p0001,popular,mh_wp,"Apparently, finding interpreters is impossible.",88,deaf,"This is absolutely unacceptable.  I am an interpreter, and I have worked in mental health settings in a supervisory capacity (not as an interpreter).  About 30% of our residents were deaf.  There was an interpreter at EVERY junction of the residents’ mental health therapy and care, AND the faculty and staff (including me, a supervisor) could sign.  A facility like the one I worked at is not the norm, but it certainly exists. Where are you in the states? Also, look into remote interpreting if there are genuinely no interpreters in your area (unlikely, and not optimal, I know).   Yeah, technically a private facility can just say no.  But there are private places that will be accommodating, as well as publicly run options.
I'm truly sorry about what you're going through. It's bullshit. 

My wife is a deaf therapist, and we live in a deaf mecca (Rochester, NY) and she's very frustrated with the mental health system here. There is a serious lack of residential treatment facilities that can accommodate deaf patients. It's even worse for difficult patients, because they typically get kicked out of RTF's due to serious behavioral issues. And that basically means they have absolutely nowhere left to go.

If it's that bad here, then it's likely much worse everywhere else. Hearing people basically don't give a damn when it comes to mental health services for the deaf, and deaf therapists have difficulty trying to push this issue through the hearing-centric system.

p0003,popular,mh_wp,rant about this community,62,deaf,"I'm so sorry you received so much negative energy.  I missed your first post, so I'm not up to speed. 

It sounds like you need immediate help in the workplace.  A CI isn't going to be immediate help.  But CART can be!!!

I had a similar experience in college and I dropped out because of it.  Years later, I decided to take a chance and the school disability office introduced me to CART. It changed my life.  I honestly never world have made it through college (let alone been on the Dean's list or getting a graduate degree)  if it hasn't been for this.

 CART is basically someone typing out every single word that is being said during trainings. And the best part is that you don't have to worry about taking notes! The whole transcript is emailed to you afterwards.  This allows you to focus solely on listening instead of taking notes but if you miss hearing a word, you just look at the computer screen, and you are all caught up.  Your brain can focus on what it is leaning rather than focus on understanding words.  

This is considered a reasonable accommodation under the ADA in America.  Your company's cannot argue about trade secrets or anything to refuse providing this. 

This may be something you use your whole life or out may be something to help bridge the gap between now and when you have adapted to your CI (which can take months and exhausts you).

Now that being said.  I had my CI surgery on my 30s. I love it but there are still some downsides.  Group conversations and nose encircled are easier but it's not perfect.  In many ways, you'll still rely on old habits because they are so ingrained.   Getting my CI did make me more comfortable and accepting of being deaf. It helped me advocate for myself, and it made coworkers really understand just how deaf I am.  I became more confident in demanding others do their share of the communication burden.   That may or may not be what happens for you.  I still use oral speech as my primary communication tool.  A CI is a tool to help you reach your goals. Nobody can tell you what your communicating goals are and who you have to be.
* Are you able to get a CART service at your college if you are still in college? The CART service made a huge difference on my end. I always had ASL interpreters in my college classes, but it did not help me because I had to focus on the interpreters. I didn't have time to translate from ASL to English. So, I couldn't write down any notes at all. The CART service exceeded my note taking needs. 
* Please let your professor know the benefits of wearing a microphone / transmitter. Hopefully, he will change his mind. 
* As for the internship, were you able to get your retraining at this time with your accommodation needs being fulfilled? How long are you staying at this internship? Are you getting paid at this internship? 
   * If yes, you are entitled to reasonable accommodations at internships and jobs in order to thrive in this workplace. There is no way for employers to decline your reasonable accommodations. Please don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. 
      * Please make a list of your reasonable accommodations in a professional manner and email the HR department (copy this email to your personal email address too). Work email addresses can be deleted permanently. So, you could have enough paper trails for future lawsuits, in case they turn down your reasonable accommodations. 
* Getting CIs is up to you. It's all about you. It's your decision. It will be part of your life permanently. You just need to ensure that you will not have any regrets in the end. I'm Deaf and ineligible for getting CIs. I have a couple of friends who have CIs. They say both good and bad things about having the CIs. 
   * Cons 
      * CIs giving static background (They can be corrected by your audiologist specialized in CIs) 
      * Hearing fatigue (You can just release your transmitter from your head whenever you take a break) 
      * CIs failed, they were not functioning at all (You can just see your audiologist to fix this issue. If your audiologist recommends removing CIs, you would spend money again for the surgery) 
      * Insurance might not cover the CI costs (Keep looking for different insurances until you find one) 
   * Pros
      * Able to hear sounds that you never heard when you wore hearing aids
      * Able to listen to music if you are a big fan of music (connect via bluetooth)
      * Able to swim with CIs (Hearing aids don't work in water if it stays submerged too long)
      * Able to hear your voice better when you speak. Adjust your voice.

When you turn off your CIs, you are still deaf, right? I treat CIs as one of the most effective communication tools for people with hearing loss.

Wow, you pretty much summed up how I felt back in HS and early years of college. As I got older, I began to realize that CI doesn't really help me as much as I expected (Idk if that makes sense?). 

When it comes to group conversation, I will guarantee to be left out because I just cannot keep up with the conversation and constantly looking at different person's faces. It really sucks and people have made fun of me for not keeping up or looking stupid when I have no clue what they're talking about. It had a big negative impact to my sense of self-worth. I just feel useless and feel like shit waking up every day knowing that I would probably get made fun of or people ignoring/give up after I keep saying ""what"". I don't know, maybe I am just soft or I just get emotional very easily lol. 

Now, I have been practicing ASL and I am currently doing ASL TA thing for a class. I honestly did feel a little better in terms of self-esteem when communicating with deaf people using ASL. I didn't keep saying ""what"" over and over again, didn't make fun of, and I did feel a little bit useful when I can contribute to a conversation. I don't mean to advertise ASL, I just find it somewhat helpful to me regarding my personal self-esteem imo (I don't feel useless every day).

Sorry for the long rant. I just really liked this topic and wished they can be more open-minded and take mental health seriously (in general) especially to the Deaf community (not saying Deaf community is perfect, they have some flaws as well).

Family gatherings I play on my phone as well because people tend to get awkward when I ask them to repeat themselves. They also like to tease I responded incorrectly from mishearing info or I am just plain exhausted trying to keep up in groups or background noise. I’m fine playing on my phone, I find it relaxing, I also need it to decompress. For some reason there’s always someone that finds it rude but hey, my mental health and being is more important than a little social gathering. 
Learning ASL after so long feels so unnatural, it’s difficult. Using ASL, the sentence structure is different form verbal so I find that challenging as well. It’s also discouraging going in person. It ends up feeling like an all day event just to learn a bit of ASL. However, when I took ASL online, at my own pace. I enjoyed learning. Gallaudet offers free courses online. See if he will start there. Then I highly recommend taking the the ASL and Deaf Studies certification. Again, the online and convenience of it I think will help.

This situation happens nearly every time I go out: Hearing person starts talking, I quickly interrupt and let them know that I’m deaf and can read their lips. They either start yelling at me because they think louder means comprehension (when it just messes up lip movement and makes it even harder to read them), or they give me a pity party: “I’m so sorry…”

I deal with it by basically staying within my circle of family and friends that I can communicate with via sign. I’ve turned down a lot of invites to go clubbing, parties, any social event if there will be more than two or three hearing people due to how exhausting it gets to follow the conversation.

You’ll just stress yourself out if you keep dwelling on how it makes you feel. Find an outlet that allows you to feel included and involved, not as easy to do as it is to type that, but that’s a method that’s helped me a lot.

Honestly it's not a bad thing to go talk to a psychiatrist or counselor.  Mental health is important and it looks so different for different people.  It's not like they're going to immediately say you need medication or you're weird, or you're going to get thrown into 24/7 mental unit or whatever.  It's just to help you sort things out in a safe, educated way.
It's hard to admit to oneself that you have a disability. At most, you want to look at it as an inconvenience or annoyance that you can just cope with. Because, for it to be a real thing, feels like an admission of weakness.

And also, a lot of people just don't know what to do about their deafness. They just think they're broken. And it's easy to get stuck in that rut.

Sometimes you need someone else to help you see past the immediate problems and find whatever the right path forward is. Deafness can be a big barrier, and a lot of people need help knowing what to do next.

p0018,popular,mh_wp,What do you want the hearing community to understand?,16,deaf,"I wish I knew more about the intent behind the slideshow, but have you considered having your friend make the presentation for you?  Maybe it's a school requirement and you can't, but it seems like the information would be better actually coming from a Deaf individual than someone trying to speak on behalf of the community.  I don't doubt your intentions, but I don't know the extent of your knowledge and understanding.  Presenting yourself like an expert is something to be wary of.

That said, I would suggest adding a section on best practice for communicating through an interpreter, especially in situations where the information being exchanged is sensitive in nature.  It might seem obvious but you'd be surprised how many people will only look at an interpreter and not the Deaf individual, or who will speak directly *to* the interpreter rather than the actual client.  In situations where concerns about confidentiality and really heavy or emotional topics are a consideration, it's important that the interpreter not be walking in totally blind, or that the health professional not assume that they are in a position to make decisions on the behalf of the client.  Things like that.

It's very important that people recognize that Deaf culture **is** exactly that... a culture with values, ideas, and behaviors that differ from hearing culture.  That's especially critical to realize when a health professional might be drawing conclusions about a person's state of wellbeing from the way that they present themselves or behave.  Honestly, it's a huge subject to try to broach.  Not a simple or straightforward undertaking at all.

p0019,popular,mh_wp,How do I deal with loosing my hearing?,11,deaf,"Hey op the other comment left here is super negative and I’m sorry that person feels that way but it is not the outlook that you also have to have if you don’t want to. Totally normal and okay to have a lot of big and negative emotions about your hearing but it doesn’t have to be so black and white like the other comment made it seem. I’m not going to say suddenly losing your hearing at a young age is easy. I suddenly lost a good chunk in one ear when I was 8 and it has progressed slowly until that ear has lost all hearing, im now 22. There are things that I face due to my deafness sometimes that will make me sad but over time those have become less as I’ve learned about how to accomodate and the things I can’t do anything about I’m getting better at just accepting. Because not everyone can do everything, we all have limitations that we have to accept. And having a good support system is helpful because a good support system is the type to learn sign language with you or find other ways to still communicate with you as you lose hearing, they don’t allow you to just get completely left out. Having a good support system means having people that may not understand but that you can vent to, and connecting to your local deaf community can give you both of those things. Having a good support system means having one that believes you when you say you didn’t hear them and makes adjustments to help you. I think it may be easy for some to say that a good support system does nothing because they’ve never had a bad one and don’t know how much that would have worsened their situation. It’s more common than not for families to not even attempt to learn sign language for their deaf family member. It’s also super common for deaf kids to have been told they were faking and not received any accommodation as a result. People who have healthy support systems are lucky even if they don’t realize it. Eta: obviously based on what you shared you are experiencing both. Your parents aren’t being the best support system currently and are adding to your feelings. Have you tried talking to them directly about it though? Maybe things are being misinterpreted or maybe they need to be talked to to even understand the struggles that come with losing your hearing. And you also have your good support system that’s there for you but you struggle to depend on. Also normal. The more you can accommodate yourself the better it often is for your mental health and it’s also good to remind yourself that everyone needs help with things sometimes. 

I’m not going to pretend being deaf isn’t a disability though. It does disable you from interacting with the world without at least some accommodation. That does make life hard. I’m not downplaying that. I’m just saying that it doesn’t have to be the end of your life being happy or good. Life can still be beautiful and happy without your hearing. It’s of course a big adjustment and doesn’t feel fair and it’s normal for it to be a lot to process but it’s possible to make the adjustment and live a good life. It’s normal to have anxiety or even panic at the loss of a sense and it’s possible to work through the emotions and find comfort in your other senses.
I'm 57.  I've been HoH since I was 7 years old and wearing hearing aids.  I'm profoundly deaf now as speech comprehension is greatly diminished and retired.  

First of all, don't beat yourself up.  It's not your fault.  You aren't a liability.  

I can relate to your anxiety of losing your hearing.  It's frightening and you feel very alone.  
Believe me, things will get better.  A lot better.  It helps to have local support and I would  
encourage you to attempt to make friends with others who are HoH / deaf.  

If you have an iPhone, I use Group Transcribe that turns speech to text.  It's quite useful  
in noisy environments where hearing aids are pretty much useless.  It's very good at  
picking up conversations.

Also keep your mental health in check.  Depression will over-take you if you wallow in  
your despair.  I had to start taking anti-depressants once I went profoundly deaf and  
had to quit my career that I loved.  It's important to keep those dark thoughts away.  
Don't give up.  

My hearing aids are bluetooth and I can stream all phone calls and music directly into  
my hearing aid.  This alone has been a life saver for me.  Also, if you want to feel the   
music -- look into SkullCandy's Crusher EVO headset.  It has haptics so there's no   
damage to your ears, but the bass will rattle your skull and you'll love it.  

Yeah, it sucks, but you'll be fine.  Lots of people out there with some type of disability,  
so you're not alone.  The advancements in finding a cure for deafness is improving, so  
keep your fingers crossed.

Stay strong.
are you able to wear the headphones over your hearing aids??? the haptics alone sound interesting so i definitely would love to give them a try.

I agree with keeping your mental health in check.. for years I could get by normally with my limited hearing until the day came where i couldn't. When you realize you can't go about your life the same as you once did, it's a hard adjustment.

**OP, keep your head up and make peace with this new normal. Lean on this community and know that you're not alone.** I'm sorry about your parents, just chuck it up to ignorance. They can't comprehend your experience without having lived it. Just focus on looking forward. It takes time for your brain to adjust to all the sound coming from your hearing aid, but if you feel that some things are too loud that's definitely worth talking to your audiologist about, they can adjust everything to a reasonable level. Once you start feeling comfortable with your hearing aids, concerts shouldn't be an issue although I'd think about getting some hearing protection of some kind (i read eargasm is a good brand for that).",hey op comment left super negative im sorry person feel way outlook also dont want totally normal okay lot big negative emotion hearing doesnt black white like comment made seem im going say suddenly losing hearing young age easy suddenly lost good chunk one ear progressed slowly ear lost hearing im thing face due deafness sometimes make sad time become less ive learned accomodate thing cant anything im getting better accepting everyone everything limitation accept good support system helpful good support system type learn sign language find way still communicate lose hearing dont allow get completely left good support system mean people may understand vent connecting local deaf community give thing good support system mean one belief say didnt hear make adjustment help think may easy say good support system nothing theyve never bad one dont know much would worsened situation common family even attempt learn sign language deaf family member also super common deaf kid told faking received accommodation result people healthy support system lucky even dont realize eta obviously based shared experiencing parent arent best support system currently adding feeling tried talking directly though maybe thing misinterpreted maybe need talked even understand struggle come losing hearing also good support system thats struggle depend also normal accommodate better often mental health also good remind everyone need help thing sometimes im going pretend deaf isnt disability though disable interacting world without least accommodation make life hard im downplaying im saying doesnt end life happy good life still beautiful happy without hearing course big adjustment doesnt feel fair normal lot process possible make adjustment live good life normal anxiety even panic loss sense possible work emotion find comfort sens im ive hoh since year old wearing hearing aid im profoundly deaf speech comprehension greatly diminished retired first dont beat fault arent liability relate anxiety losing hearing frightening feel alone believe thing get better lot better help local support would encourage attempt make friend others hoh deaf iphone use group transcribe turn speech text quite useful noisy environment hearing aid pretty much useless good picking conversation also keep mental health check depression overtake wallow despair start taking antidepressant went profoundly deaf quit career loved important keep dark thought away dont give hearing aid bluetooth stream phone call music directly hearing aid alone life saver also want feel music look skullcandys crusher evo headset haptics there damage ear bass rattle skull youll love yeah suck youll fine lot people type disability youre alone advancement finding cure deafness improving keep finger crossed stay strong able wear headphone hearing aid haptics alone sound interesting definitely would love give try agree keeping mental health check year could get normally limited hearing day came couldnt realize cant go life hard adjustment op keep head make peace new normal lean community know youre alone im sorry parent chuck ignorance cant comprehend experience without lived focus looking forward take time brain adjust sound coming hearing aid feel thing loud thats definitely worth talking audiologist adjust everything reasonable level start feeling comfortable hearing aid concert shouldnt issue although id think getting hearing protection kind read eargasm good brand,positive,0.27,0.579,0.151,0.9979,0.1339050829410553,0.3839355409145355,0.48215943574905396,neutral
p0020,popular,mh_wp,Putting all the pieces together and getting it off my chest,10,deaf,"Have you spoken to a mental health professional about your troubles hearing? I'm a hearing person working with a research group who look at what it's like being DHH in a hearing world from a psychological perspective, and I have learned a lot about how hearing loss effects mental well-being, though I am by absolutely no means an expert.

For example, you may experience more social anxiety symptoms, like say, after situations where people laugh after you say something that you thought was the appropriate response because you misheard the question, or more mental fatigue from having to cognitively 'work' harder to make up for the information that is missing about your environment.

It's something that I think you should think about, and don't leave it too long before you get your hearing assessed - at least then you can take charge of it and figure out what's going to be the best for you going forward. 

Btw, it sounds like you have an amazing support network at home, that's awesome :)
Thanks. I'll bookmark this and definitely look into it some more. Like I said, I know I'll get it taken care of, I just have a lot of obstacles. 

I also have PTSD so certain sounds (especially if they're sudden or I'm uncertain of where they're coming from) really weigh on my anxiety. When I get back to my mental health clinic I'll mention it to the doctor and see what advice they have going further. I have no doubt that the hearing loss plays a part in my mental health in some ways. I hope I didn't come off as if I don't think it's important.

p0023,popular,mh_wp,Mental health counseling student looking to improve counseling services for Deaf/ HOH Clients,9,deaf,"My experience is rather limited, as I intended to start therapy again right before pandemic hit, and my experience are from the times I was severely depressed, so it didn't really cover a lot of my life.

But... what I can say is that I have noticed that not only professionals aren't aware (or understand) the Deaf cultura, they also aren't aware of how much society can be ableist and how that can compound with other mental health issues and identities, as well, not understanding how capitalism is extremely oppressive and problematic for disabled people (not only deaf/Deaf/HoH), or even how society can teach us a lot of subtle messages in ways that a non disabled person doesn't even realize. And of course, they tend to not be aware of any disability history.

Many professionals are like ""oh yeah, but that doesn't really have any relation to..."", being extremely dismissive, as if we can just turn off our disability in our daily life and not be affected by it or as if our disability is just a minor detail that can't be connected to everything or anything at all.

I remember when I started looking for psychologist, one of my criteria was understanding how my HoH identity can tangle with other identities (such as being queer and non binary, as well asexual) and struggles and possible mental health diagnosis. For example, I have a couple of suspicions that I might be on the spectrum, however, when doing some tests, a lot of it feels familiar, but I don't know if those experience and feelings can be 100% due to my hearing loss (and all the consequences plus a lot of how society treat me) or if it's a mixed bag and so on. (Not sure if that made sense, let me know and I'll try to find a better way to explain, as English isn't my native language).

And to be honest, I didn't get far with that criteria. It's easy to find professionals that can understand how racism is deeply tangled with other stuff or even how LGBT+ identities can be tangled with other stuff, but it's extremely rare to find someone with minimal knowledge of not only the culture, but as well the disability history, and all the subtleties of the disabled/Deaf/deaf/HoH identity.

Recently, at an event, I ran into a friend's sister who is a psychologist, and one word lead to another, I mentioned that I have never felt as the main character of my own story, due to how I grew up, lack of representation, lack of understanding, as well how society teaches us that we aren't worth of affection, love, but instead, disaffection, disgust and so on, and the face of realization she had was a massive one, and even said something along the lines of ""That is so mind-blowing, I'm surprised that in no moment of my education or even afterwards, I never once stopped to think that treating patients that are disabled or Deaf/deaf/HoH is as complex as treating that are Black, queer/LGBT+, women and so on."" She wasn't aware of how deep the issues can run in the disabled community.

Im so sorry. This sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening. Have you considered applying to one of the online mental health services like talkspace?
When I was sighted I worked in mental health, specifically forensics.  Psych hospitals and residential facilities in the community.

I know it's not something you want to hear, but I can understand where they are coming from, when they require a driving licence.

Your job as mental health support, is to assist the clients with activities they cannot do and assist them in daily living activities.  Especially if you are working 1-1.

>Every place I have applied to requires a driver's license to transport clients to medical appointments, community outings, etc.

It's a big part of the job.  Just because it's a residential facility doesn't mean they are stuck inside all day.  You could be taking them to shop for new clothes, a walk in the park, or any other number of activities that require travel.

If you have a disability that prevents you from adequate assisting/facilitating the clients needs, that isn't fair on them.

If their mental health issues can cause them to lash out or act unpredictably, especially if they have poor impulse control when frustrated, it can put them at risk as well as yourself.  If you're alone with a client and they get violent, quite frankly you're fucked  if you're blind.

If they have a forensic history, you need to be able to read body language and facial expressions to stop certain situations before they start.  


At the end of the day the clients wellbeing is paramount.  I can understand your frustration but this is one area where I can see not employing someone who is blind is justifiable.
I'm in California about to start my masters in mental health counseling, but I wanted to reach out and see how things turned out for you. I know it's been a couple of years.
I would like to know more about your experience as a therapist who is blind. I noticed that you posted about it a few years ago. I am about to begin my master's degree in mental health counseling and would appreciate any advice or support you can offer.
My guess is cost.  When I worked in mental health any extra costs were tightly controlled.

Say you have 1 trip per day with a client, could be Drs, shopping, etc....

£10 each way is £20.

Say you have 4 staff members that can't drive (not just because of blindness), that's potentially £80/day or £560/week just on taxi/uber.

Due to low mental health funding, money is often pretty tight.

I'm not sure how things work where you live but do you have an IEP and a vision teacher (when I was growing up I had a teacher that came in and had a class where I learned braille, O&M, how to do things independently, etc). It sounds like you could use some adult help advocating for you with the school administration and your teacher. By all means you should also advocate for yourself but having other people in your corner is a good thing and you shouldn't be ashamed to ask people that care about you to get involved for you. Some teachers / people just suck and hopefully you get through her class and never have to have her teach you again.

..I can relate to a lot of what you said. Having aniridia, especially when i was younger and my vision was much better than it is now, my visual impairmenr/legal blindness was largely invisible to people, and in a way I never really fit in and was somewhere alone in between the sighted and non sighted worlds. Honestly it kinda fucking sucks and certainly didn't help my mental health lol.

Have you gotten the chance to meet other visually impaired and blind people your age? I remember going to summer camps that were just for those groups and it being fun and a good learning experience. I also got to go to space camp when I was little with other kids like me and it was really cool.

I feel you on the privileges thing, sighted people are way more privileged than they will ever realize or admit and a lot of people just suck and are ableist peices of shit. The number of people that can't drive for shit and don't know the right of way laws from their own ass makes my blood boil knowing that I know how to drive and can't yet these fuckers can and don't know how putting other peoples lives in danger because they don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves just pisses me off so much---anyways! Before I keep ranting lol.

I think that everyone learns differently and you just have to find the ways that work for you. You putting in the work is what matters and so long as you pass a certain grade isn't forever and won't hold you back in life--especially in college you'll find that some professors are easy graders, most are fair and follow the rubric, and some teachers are just impossible with their grading and expectations. You will get out of your degree what you put into it and the skills of how you do that are more important than what grade you get. What I'm trying to say is don't beat yourself up too much and try not to overstress. Try for great grades certainly but at the end of the day be kind to yourself.

I have seen some amazing people in this world and I don't think any career ambitions are necessarily out of the question simply because you are blind. I'm not sure what your career ambitions are but you should definitely do your research and try to connect with blind people that have been where you want to go. I think having examples and finding a mentor would be greatly beneficial to you.

Best of luck and don't give up. You need your right now.
I'm so sorry that this has happened to you.

None of this is your fault, and there is nothing lacking within yourself. People behave this way when they lack the ability to empathise, and/or refuse to educate themselves properly. As a teacher, they definitely ought to be doing so.

I do not think you are mentally unstable, I think you are a human being struggling with circumstances most cannot understand. School is hard enough without extra needs and challenges to overcome, but I do worry about the impact this could have on your mental health.

Is there someone you can trust and talk to? And does your school have any support for students with extra needs? Ideally there would be a way to report all of this and have it dealt with, but I am unsure about how the school system where you are operates.

For what it's worth you have talent, and you are capable of seeing the world very clearly (so to speak, I apologise).

p0027,popular,mh_wp,Eight years of total blindness and I'm yet to find a reason to live,49,Blind,"Well if I have ADHD, it hasn't been diagnosed yet, and I've been through a lot of mental health specialists during the last 8 years.  I've also Googled ADHD and at least the description in the featured snippet doesn't sound like me at all.  I'm not impulsive, don't struggle with paying attention, attempt to predict the outcome of all my actions, and am not very energetic.  The reason why I used to play games was twofold: I liked to immerse myself in another reality and be the hero in single-player games and I liked to help others achieve their objectives in cooperative multi-player games.

As for my motivation, I lose it because I can't perform as well as I like.  For example I just bought another Raspberry Pi along with its official touchscreen despite being totally blind because I want to play around with computer graphics on Linux and want to dedicate my first Pi to serve content on the Internet, however I will most likely get demotivated once the project for which I bought it is near completion because little things that I cannot pay attention to due to being blind will affect the final experience and I will only learn about them too late.  I've been through this before, but keep acting like I still have sight or this time it will be different.

I'm a creative person, and attention to detail used to characterize me.  My goal in life used to be to provide memorable experiences that people could feel unconsciously even if they couldn't appreciate.  I feel good not when people compliment me but rather when they try the same kind of product made by someone else and complain about things they hadn't even thought about while using my creations, and to that end I don't mind to put more effort into making things than most would, but I also expect quality as a result.

p0030,popular,mh_wp,How To Be Blind (a tutorial),30,Blind,"I, also, do not have many friends. Or more accurately, I do not have many friends outside of the blind community. And of course, even within the community, there is this, fear, of saying too much. I recognize that I am one of the luckier ones, in the sense that all I have known is blindness. I never lost something. For me, one of the most difficult aspects of it all is the mystery of my diagnosis. I am an adopted child, and the director of the orphanage created a fake record for me less than a year before the adoption. It is strange, I know many blind children who were adopted from China at an older age. For me, it comes with a different sort of... pressure to withhold my complaints. My mother told me that the director of the orphanage questioned her for a long time, asking why she really wanted a blind child. They knew exactly what they were getting into. I know, I was wanted. A strange thing for which to harbor any other emotions save gratitude and happiness. They knew that adjustments would have to be made; they were aware of the logistic challenges. But as I grapple with watching my sighted sister spread her wings and fly, while I remain grounded by limitations that I cannot change, and a splintering mental health, I always wonder, did they really know what they were getting into? I wonder how many blind people are unhappy, but refuse to recognize or attribute it to being blind for some reason or another. We are given canes and taught to cross streets. We are taught daily living skills while feeling inferior for having to be specifically instructed. We watch people drive, run independently, make eye contact, and there is a part, of me at any rate, that wants to make a venn diagram and show my parents, people in general, that they don't get it. People think it simple jealousy, petty lack of willingness to accept reality. You know those times where you set something down and can't find it? You know it's right there. Or when something, like a sheaf of papers, falls, and you wonder if you have gotten all of them, but if you haven't you should keep feeling, and if you have you are wasting your time... 
And all of this to circle back to complaining. Biting my tongue is a skill I have learned, at least when it comes to my blindness and how I feel, when talking to sighted people. I know that I use the term sighted people very loosely. I am sorry if I offend anyone; I understand that there are many people who try, very hard, to understand. Please forgive me.
My original point was simply to say, please, feel free to PM me, whether it is to complain, to revisit a past that people are telling you to move on from... I am always here to listen, perhaps because I know what it is to repress everything, and when it comes out, that feeling of being a burden.

p0031,popular,mh_wp,How is your mental health?,23,Blind,"I was born blind, premature by a number of months. The oxygen needed to keep my brain going was fatal to my retinas, and so I have had no useful vision all my life.

I was very lucky apart from that, though. Despite an apathetic set of parents who didn’t care to get involved with any blind adaptations or organisations and indeed who made it quite clear they didn’t intend to have me and it was my younger, sighted siblings who were the wanted children, I thrived as a child. I was well-supported in education, I made friends. Yes, I became one of the nerds, but the nerds were a group of their own. I didn’t need respect from the whole student body, I was used to not having it from my own parents, after all. I found my niche and settled in, and learning became my thing, backed by technology.

For a decade and a half, this worked well. I grew. I learned. I found ways of understanding things I couldn’t interpret. Proving the existence of clouds to my satisfaction meant a trip in a hot air balloon, because I couldn’t see them and other empirical tests – like covering the sun with another object – didn’t satisfy me. I was curious, polite, inquisitive and excited by the potentials offered by technology to improve my own lot in life, and happy to use my blindness as a teaching tool for others. It became a true part of me, rather than something apart from me. I embraced it. 

Mental health wasn’t on my RADAR at that point. My own health had never brought up any questions in that regard: I’d fallen out of trees and smashed my head on rocks, sprained things and pulled muscles, but nothing other than the physical. The first time I ever really felt that my blindness was a problem was a day when my sighted friends began to take off on their bikes, leaving me behind. I’d been involved in everything else up to that point, and standing outside school, hearing the tick tick tick of their bicycles fading into the distance was the first time I had a bitter upswelling of envy for those who could do what I couldn’t.

I went home. I dialed up to the online bulletin board systems and Multi-user dungeons I’d played for years and marauded my high-level characters through dangerous areas, the thrill of being good at something I’d worked hard for counterbalancing the emotions dredged up by being abandoned. After I’d cooled down, I realized that, for every trip they took out on their bikes, there’d still be more to the cinema, or shops, or bowling alley, just like all the other times. Cross-country biking was an extra to the things they did, not a replacement for the things we did.

My next real shock came when I moved from school to college. I’d had regular access to a sighted assistant up to this point: I’d not needed it often, particularly as I grew more confident in my own use of technology, and the fact that I was left alone by them much of the time served me well in bonding with my sighted peers. Still, the safety net of them being there, plus their ability to fight for accessible work or to adapt it ready for lessons, was a crutch I didn’t know I needed. The 2 years at college without such a level of support was grueling. Being handed print textbooks at the start of a lesson and told to use them like everyone else was … eye-openingly impossible, and began to make me realise just how ablest the word could be, although that word didn’t really enter my vocabulary at that point.

This pattern was to repeat itself throughout my life. For every one job interview I attended in hope, perhaps five or six people turned me away with legitimate-sounding reasons for not employing me, thinly veiling the fact that the real reason was my blindness. Legally, they couldn’t say it, but as a practical matter, if two people apply for the same job and one requires less adaptations or changes to existing working systems, most of the time, the disabled person loses.

Despite all this, I was resolute in my blind happiness. I’d known no different, after all. Seeing was a concept to me, not a way of life. I would have happily given away physical parts of my eyes to help other people see more clearly if medically feasible.  And then we had a child.

Another pivotal moment came during my child’s toddler days. She was an articulate child – she had to be, pointing at things and making noises didn’t get her anywhere. We walked into a fast-food restaurant during the school holidays. I remember vividly the flood of warm air as we crossed the threshold, the roar of noisy voices, the clangor of diners ordering and eating and playing, kids screaming, parents shouting. And us waiting to be seated in all that, and me knowing intellectually that my daughter was only a few small footsteps away from me yet utterly cut off, aurally, from my senses.   This was the point at which I really began to want vision. Getting on or off the right bus, knowing precisely if I was about to walk into the correct building or room, being assured of my place in line – these had all been things I’d previously struggled with whilst out-and-about with my child, where just a little bit of vision could have helped.  I’d grumbled a little about them internally, but accepted it as part of my life. And this entry into the furor of the restaurant tipped me into thinking that, even the smallest chance of some vision, medically, mechanically, computationally or however, would be something to jump at.

This burning desire has faded as my daughter has grown older. The more I’ve done with her, the more independent I have become and the more ability and understanding she has developed, the need has become less pressing. I was already very happy to use technology to aid me, and that’s only gotten better with time. When we left college as a couple, reading print letters required a flatbed scanner and desktop computer arrangement, taking up half our living room and minutes to read a sheet of paper. Now, I can flip through a handful of letters, point them at the camera poking out of my shirt pocket, and have them sorted by recipient before I’ve finished walking through my house. The ability to read handwriting came next, smashing the barrier of identifying who sent us Christmas cards and bringing a major upswing to my efficiency in the office (yes, my colleagues can now leave handwritten post-it notes on my desk). And just this week, we’ve sent our daughter off on a school trip and I am actually looking forward to the photos she’ll send back from her phone, because of the descriptive abilities of the large language models we now have access to. 

For me, blindness is an inextricable part of who I am. I work in the field of visual impairment. I play adapted sports. I read on a Braille display rather than an eInk kindle, although I am always careful to point out that the source material I read is now the same as everyone else’s, just on a different screen. This is a far cry from my own school days, when putting a book into Braille meant physical, mechanical  labour. Being a computer programmer has undeniably helped me through life – I’ve written dozens of tools for my own edification over the years.  And it is that comfort with and power of technology that I think is my mental life line. I am fortunate beyond my wildest imaginings as a teen. If You’d told my 16-year-old self that he would be able to access handwritten notes at work, or comprehend pictures from holiday snaps, he would have laughed at you. ‘No way’, I’d have said. ‘Blind people can’t access that sort of thing.’

I’d have been right, of course. But things change. And the pace of change has never been greater. And this is what keeps me going. The time I’d spend wallowing in misery would be time I could miss these potential breakthroughs. And so for every little niggle of inaccessibility, for every bump along the road, I think about the road ahead. If I can hop over that bump or smoothen out that wrinkle, what might lie over the horizon?  I could no more have predicted the things I can do now back then than I can predict what access I will have a decade from now. But I do know that, if I persist in living a happy and healthy life, engaged with the blind community, using my technological skills to help other people whilst earning a living and bringing up my child to appreciate that a disability isn’t a lack of ability in other areas, I can cope.

Times are hugely tough right now. My income hasn’t gone up, but the bills have. Just this month the mortgage has jumped up by nearly a third. Electricity, heating and food are also on the rise. None of it is blind related, but all of it impacts how much disposable income we have, and that is blindy – because the money we use on taxis and the extra costs of blindness has become squeezed. I guess we just have to remain careful and cautious, pick our way through the difficulties as best we can. But not lose sight of the fact that seeing is by no means necessary to live a happy, productive life in 2023 in this country, and that is something I am very grateful for.
I'm 41, and My mental health was great until I went totally blind 9 years ago, because as long as I had sight, and even though I only had 10% acuity, there were still things, like playing video-games and coding, that I could still do completely unhindered and where I could feel normal. I also led a fully independent life where my only annoyance was that my employer only let me work from home on Thursdays (this was 15 years before COVID made remote work more prevalent). Then I went blind and had a 5 year long dark period in which all I wanted was to die, and even went through a single psychotic break which ended up with me locked up in a psychiatric hospital for 3 weeks due to being considered a danger to myself. While I never actually tried to kill myself, because I was always afraid of surviving a suicide attempt and ending up with even more disabilities, if there was such a thing as a pill that I could take to end my life I would have taken it back then and would still take it right now. That said these days I try to make the best of the hand that life dealt me, and am eagerly yet patiently waiting for my natural or accidental death, or an opportunity to safely exit life.

What made me recover from the darkest times of my life was the realization that I could still code blind as well as the normalization of my current condition. I can still remember how great life was back then, and would love to return to those days, but for some reason, the more time passes, the more I tend to think of my former sighted days as dreams. Able and healthy people don't even realize how incredibly lucky they are, and to be honest I get a little infuriated with the fact that so many healthy people waste away their lifes with futility instead of investing into self development and into making the world a better place.
I’m 25. A lot of issues have been piling up over the last few weeks that affected my mental health mentally. A lot of these issues come from the visual impairment and I feel a little defeated
I’m 62 and was just recently diagnosed as legally blind. The disease is progressive and there’s nothing to be done. 

I already had mental health challenges. Now I am going through the five stages of grief as I lose my vision. I hate losing my independence. I’m hoping to find group therapy to talk to other people about this.

I’m sorry you’re struggling. I am too.
I’m 23 and recently lost a significant amount of vision due to a illness… My mental health is not good at all currently it happened six months ago and I’m still reeling from it. My life has been completely flipped upside down. I don’t know what to do there’s no resources where I live. I can’t drive anymore. I can’t do anything that I wanted to do or had planned to do with my life because of this and honestly Every day I wish that I never woke up… The only thing keeping me together is my family I guess… But everyone’s getting sick of me complaining and being depressed I’m sure I don’t even know what to do. I really hate it here… A piece of me is still holding out hope that something will change, but another part of me is like I need to be realistic and except this is the life I live… I DK how much longer I’m gonna be here, but I’m gonna hold on until I can’t any longer.
Well, I’d say my mental health is stable now, but I’ve had my ups and downs not only because of my blindness, but also because of my upbringing, and the fact that I have been moving from country to country beginning my teenage years, which has left me with no physical friends, and a bunch of good long-distance friends.  I am definitely successful academically, but the isolation that comes with blindness really sucks. Now  20 years old in college I have managed to come to terms with it by reading a lot and playing video games when accessible. Recently, after a long search, just found a quasi job and will use part of the money that I will be making there to travel around to meet up with my lomg-distance friends to see if I can find life a little more enjoyable lol

Good for you for recognizing that things need to change so that you can maintain your friendship while making sure that one person isn't carrying the load for all the practical/logistics side of things. 

While some of what you've described does come down to a lack of blindness skills, I think the bigger issue is anxiety and a lack of confidence in her own abilities, so maybe that's the place to start. She knows how to use the machine to pay for things, but gets anxious and asks you to do it. She gets upset and anxious if you ignore her requests for help. She has an app for reading labels, but asks you to do it instead. All of these things are tasks she has demonstrated the capability to do, so it's not really about skill. You can teach her over and over and over again, but if her lack of knowledge isn't the problem, you're getting nowhere and becoming more and more frustrated in the process. 

Some of these things will be beyond your ability to address. While it's great that you're there for emotional support, calming her down and soothing her anxiety all the time is a different thing entirely. Working through this with a mental health professional will help her to get to the root of what's going on in her life and empower her to make changes. It won't be easy, but it will be so worth it. A therapist or other professional can talk through the things she's struggling with emotionally, plus they can determine if there's an imbalance that meds could help with. If nothing else, it can really help to have an outside perspective, because things have been this way for so long that it's difficult for her to even imagine how they could be different. 

Others have given some great suggestions about making sure she's connected with any blindness services she might need, like a training center or an o&m instructor. While that's happening, think about some small but significant things you both could do to change things in the household. The first step is to sit down and talk about things, at a point when you're both in a good headspace. She needs to know that you truly do love her, but things can't continue this way. She needs to know you believe in her, maybe more than she believes in herself right now. She may become upset or defensive, which in no way means you have done something wrong and should drop it. 

Once you've really got an open conversation going, you could start by making an agreement together on something small that you'll work on. An example might be her makeup. Let's say you've taught her, or she's learned from a tutorial, how to put on her lipstick. You could agree together that if she'd like you to do her makeup that day, she'll do the lipstick. If she's not feeling comfortable or confident enough when the time comes, you could be gently encouraging and supportive without actually stepping in to do all the makeup that day like you always have done before. If it turns out she doesn't wear any that day, no one is harmed and it's not the end of the world, but an important boundary has been established. 

I wish you both all the best in navigating this, and no matter what happens, please do take some time for yourself. You deserve it!
I have to agree. I'm not blind or considered visually impaired (joined the sub as have some vision loss that can't be corrected) so I can't speak from that perspective but have worked in mental health and with people with varying levels of vision. I have to agree that this sounds like a confidence or mental health thing. It sounds like she's feeling vulnerable or insecure so is asking for help with things she's capable of as a way of getting the reassurance she feels she needs to feel more safe and secure.

Once you've started helping someone in this way it can feel tricky to reset the boundaries but if it can be done in a way that demonstrates kindness and compassion I think that would be really helpful in promoting her confidence and create a healthier relationship for them both.",wow sound like youre amazing thoughtful friend evident really care wellbeing said youre exhausted youre taking work two people thats fair sustainable good recognizing thing need change maintain friendship making sure one person isnt carrying load practicallogistics side thing youve described come lack blindness skill think bigger issue anxiety lack confidence ability maybe thats place start know use machine pay thing get anxious asks get upset anxious ignore request help app reading label asks instead thing task demonstrated capability really skill teach lack knowledge isnt problem youre getting nowhere becoming frustrated process thing beyond ability address great youre emotional support calming soothing anxiety time different thing entirely working mental health professional help get root whats going life empower make change wont easy worth therapist professional talk thing shes struggling emotionally plus determine there imbalance med could help nothing else really help outside perspective thing way long difficult even imagine could different others given great suggestion making sure shes connected blindness service might need like training center om instructor thats happening think small significant thing could change thing household first step sit talk thing point youre good headspace need know truly love thing cant continue way need know believe maybe belief right may become upset defensive way mean done something wrong drop youve really got open conversation going could start making agreement together something small youll work example might makeup let say youve taught shes learned tutorial put lipstick could agree together shed like makeup day shell lipstick shes feeling comfortable confident enough time come could gently encouraging supportive without actually stepping makeup day like always done turn doesnt wear day one harmed end world important boundary established wish best navigating matter happens please take time deserve agree im blind considered visually impaired joined sub vision loss cant corrected cant speak perspective worked mental health people varying level vision agree sound like confidence mental health thing sound like shes feeling vulnerable insecure asking help thing shes capable way getting reassurance feel need feel safe secure youve started helping someone way feel tricky reset boundary done way demonstrates kindness compassion think would really helpful promoting confidence create healthier relationship,positive,0.354,0.531,0.115,0.9988,0.34669211506843567,0.16366547346115112,0.48964250087738037,neutral

It is currently kitten season - that time of year when shelters are overflowing with kittens. You could volunteer to help socialize new kittens at the shelters if you're unsure about adopting.
I'm very sorry for your loss and can definitely sympathize that grief can last a very long time.

In general, the advice I've heard is that yes, assuming finances and other circumstances permit, you should get another pet. It doesn't have to replace your previous cat whom you can still continue to love and remember fondly, but it'll be a new companion and pets help humans cope with life in a bewildering variety of ways.

With pets you also don't have to worry as much if you're still processing some emotions. For example, if you rushed into another relationship with a human partner but still hadn't processed the emotions from your previous partner, you're bound to cause some confusion and hurt feelings for both of you, but this doesn't apply to pets as long as you love and care for them.

Take some time, find a cat you really click with, and enjoy your new companion.

If your boyfriend's blindness does become severe enough that he can't work then there's several variables in the relationship that need to be addressed:     
1)  Can he be considered for disability which may offset some financial stresses?    
2)  Can you two still connect on an emotional/personal level even if he's blind or severely visually impaired?    
3) Does he have meaningful hobbies or secondary interest that could occupy his time if he cannot work?  This is important for him because otherwise he could become depressed and reclusive.    
4) Can you assist him/ or you willing to assist him in certain task?    
5) Are you or him willing to redefine not only your relationship but your future lifestyle together?

How to cope learn skills and handling emotional issues,14,Blind,"Not sure if you have other symptoms as well, but when I was tested for MS I was asked about double vision and eye issues. Hopefully it’s not that, but something to look into if your doctors haven’t already.

I have keratoconus and have had issues with my vision progressively degrading since my late teens. I was finally diagnosed in my late 20s and it was devastating knowing my eyes would continue to get worse as I aged and that I would likely need surgical procedures in the future. Up until I was able to start seeing doctors who understood the disease, eye exams always resulted in emotional breakdowns from frustration and a feeling of loss.

I highly recommend getting into therapy if you aren’t already. Talking about things coming up as you learn to cope and adjust can help. Finding online communities of people dealing with similar conditions also helped me. Look for groups that are helpful, constructive, and mostly positive. Venting is helpful and sometimes informative for others, but I’ve seen a lot of chronic pain groups devolve into competitive pity parties, “life is terrible” posts, and overwhelmingly depressing environments. If I notice anything like that, I move on for my own mental health.

As far as technology, I use larger computer screens at work and increase font sizes. I set the brightness and contrast so I can see better. I always make sure rooms I’m in regularly and can control have bright enough lighting since I have issues with seeing in the dark. I’ve mostly given up driving unless absolutely necessary, especially at night. What you need may be different, but there are settings and computer themes you can use to help better with your challenges.

I use blue light filters on my phone to remove blue light, especially at night, to avoid eye strain. Voice to text is a lifesaver at times. 

For eye health, I see my eye doctors for routine checks at least yearly to make sure the rest of my eye health is still good, since my mom found out she had glaucoma around my age. I also make sure to wear sunglasses when I’m outside for UV protection.

p0046,popular,mh_wp,Seeking psychiatric help,13,Blind,"I've often said going blind is hard but being blind is easy.

Day to day life as a blind man has been way better than I expected but going through all the emotions and grieving that comes with the diagnosis was hell.

And nobody helped. Nobody explained the profound sense of loss I was about to experience. Nobody warned me how much it hurt to realize some of my dreams would never come true. Nobody told me about the jealousy and the anger and the depression in store.

All they told me was ""Call this number for a free white cane.""

It turns out most ophthalmologists don't understand the grief we go through. They aren't trained to deal with it and if we don't bring it up they don't bring it up, either.

It's a little messed up, isn't it? We're handed a life changing diagnosis and just assumed to take it in stride.

The truth is I'd be more worried about someone who didn't have a gut wrenching emotional reaction to learning they're going blind. Anybody who can lose their job and their driver's license and their hope for the future and NOT need a therapist to discuss the turning of their world upside down is scary.

Mental health counseling should be part of the diagnosis. It's unreasonable to expect us to not get messed up when we hear it. But it's not. We have to bring it up to our eye doctors to get a referral or we have to find a therapist ourselves.

I guess this is my way of saying I sympathize, I get it, and you're not alone.

There are counselors who specialize in disabilities and in grief. Hopefully someone in this thread recommends a good one in South Carolina to you,

In the meantime my DMs are always open and I'll link you to the blog posts where I write about figuring my own way through the grief and loss.
Others have addressed things well I just wanted to mention that you may be experiencing Charles Bonette Syndrome, a form of hallucinations created by the eye itself when vision is changing. It was first noticed in cataract patients but it can happen to anyone with enough vision loss. I have it and it took two retinal specialists to tell me what it was; it flares up worse when I'm sick or stressed. If the things you're seeing in the periphery of your vision are consistent, always in the same spot, and it's been going on for awhile, it may be Charles Bonett Syndrome, which isn't dangerous but it is annoying as hell heh. 

And I second what's been said elsewhere here. Going blind sucks hardcore, being blind isn't so bad once you get used to it. I think you may be eligible now for services like Medicaid and Social Security Income and if you can get on any of those you may have better help finding some mental health coverage.
It don’t have practical advice about your mental health question, except to say that I’ve found brief counseling sessions very helpful. With the state of our health care system, I think anyone seeking medical treatment would benefit from counseling support. Maybe look into a teledoc as a first step, if you have access.

I wanted to mention, though, that what you describe sounds somewhat like the visual aura that can accompany migraine in a couple of key ways:
- Visual aura often begin with the peripheral vision, and can be accompanied by other peripheral effects like tunnel vision.
- Mine typically progress to what I can only describe as flashy light worms that dance around my central vision.
- It’s fairly common for migraine sufferers to wake up with the symptoms. They can also be triggered by the whole long list of migraine triggers, from smells & foods to hormonal shifts, sleep deprivation, or stress.

You look so lovely! love your dress, it suits you perfectly!

And thank you for helping me feel validated and less like a fraud. I’m on disability for multiple mental health reasons and sometimes o feel like my family, friends, and doctors look down on me for it but my therapist has been helping me combat that. Mental health issues can be debilitating and dangerous, I’m glad it’s a valid reason for disability even if it’s a hard battle to be approved.
I’m on disability for mental health reasons (panic disorder with agoraphobia). I just wanted to thank you for posting this. Mental health struggles are no less valid or debilitating. It makes me feel a bit less depressed to know that others (like yourself) understand.
Right! Like, I'm disabled for mental health reasons (ive been on it since i was 8) and its not like i just get a little sad and anxious sometimes. i have severe breakdowns when im under any sort of stress to the point that i could not work a full time job, even though i really wish i could!
I hate you Had To go Through with that. Just tired of ignorant Ableist people sometimes 

Yeah Your Reasons For being on Disability is Valid 

Just Made me Also think about my personal experience with people like that 

Like it makes me Very Sad that Some people don't understand 

How Much Non Visible as well as Visible Disabilities effects people 

Well for me I have Severe Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder 

And bipolar disorder and unspecified PTSD, And recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability 

Just get tired Of The Abled body making disability like the Olympics 

Like people have to compete with each other to see if they Disabilities are severe enough for disability 

Which true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function 

Which this does 

Which I have Agoraphobia I'm the opposite I can't Be Around people 

I can't even go to the Hospital without having a panic attack 

like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent 

Because I still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function 

Only time I leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult 

But I live alone don't really have support 

Since I look so Normal and functional unfortunately 

Plus people think because I'm a black man I'm immune to being disabled or having a disability 

Just kinda hard Because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community 

It effects me daily 

It's detrimental on my economic status 

It's hard to just text and talk on the phone 

Even right now I'm getting a headache 

But it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability 

Try to explain to ignorant people that are Ableist like you dealt with 

I'm quite the opposite I can't stay with people I would have a panic attack unfortunately 

It's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis 

Like they force you to share rooms which aggravates my disabilities.

And aggravates my anxiety PTSD symptoms as well 

Just everyones disability effects people differently 

Mines kinda severe to me 

Like Hate the Competition Thing abled body people created 

Sound like people have to compete with each other like freaking capitalism 

Just for Disability payments 

I hate that 

I wouldn't apply for disability if I didn't need it 

I felt so much guilt younger

People saying my disability is not severe because they can't see it 

Or people always assume you faking it 

Since mental illness they quote you can fake 

Which makes me very upset 

Because they will never know how I feel in my body and mind 

If only that knew they wouldn't be saying that 

And by the way Disability payments can't even cover Rent payments 

A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is over 1500$ for the worst area 

So probably pushing 2000$+ for a good area

Just make me upset and triggered 

Because I have no reason to make up how my disability effects my life daily 

People are so ignorant with mental illness 

They assume because I'm laughing at a movie 

Or taking a selfie 

I'm faking a mental illness 

Which makes me upset 

Like My therapist tells me to watch television using coping mechanisms to distract 

Like they don't know people with disabilities don't always have bad days 

Have a bunch of bad days 

Which I do but 

I like doing the coping mechanisms my therapist taught me 

Just make me cry a little 

Because Disabilities people can't understand what they can't see

Not trying to get emotional 

Just your post resonated with my life 

Bought up bad memories I guess 

Like people think because I workout 

Which is at home by the way 

I can't handle public commercial gyms by the way 

But people assume because I'm trying to use a coping mechanism 

To cope with my disability 

That means I'm faking it 

Or using reddit as a journal like now 

Which I'm anxious as well typing this 

Just people don't understand disabilities effect people differently 

Just Ableism in society 

Might not be to abled body person that has no problems leaving their house 

Or a person that doesn't feel like a lion is being chased after him for just talking or talking on a phone 

Like I live alone but my with my disability I couldn't live with people that would make my condition worse 

I had anxiety just living with family members 

Just because I live alone people think my mental health is not severe 

That really makes me upset 

Because Disabilities effects people differently 

Mines just as severe or life altering as anyone else 

Just because I live alone doesn't mean I'm independent 

I still can't keep a job and stuff 

I don't think being independent is until I can live a functioning life 

And people that have jobs still have disabilities 

Disability effects everyone differently 

I hate this grade scale stuff 

That Ableist people use to say you not deserving of help

Just Ableism sigh

Which I tell distant family and Ableist strangers on social media sites 

I don't have to live in a group home unfortunately 

Because my anxiety would get worse and turn to a crisis 

Just I really relate to your post op 

I guess I got triggered by you quoting Ableist people that said that to you 


But hate people feel like mental illness is not taking seriously 

Which I'm not physically disabled which I definitely respect and understand 

But speaking from a Ableist person perspective 

Like they think people with mental illness or other invisible disabilities 

Should not be considered for disability 

And they always say we lazy or faking because we lazy 

Which I would love to keep a stable job 

But capitalism doesn't value that capitalism values efficiency and profit 

And doesn't value disabled people fitting in 

Not trying to rant on capitalism because I know everyone opinions is different 

I would love to work it's just hard with my conditions

Because due to Ableism they really think People getting disability checks 

That doesn't even cover a full month of rent 

Is a luxury.

Which the Lowest paying minimum wage job pays more than disability pays people.

Like This effected me for a long time 

My whole life 

Just because it gets me emotional knowing because you don't see me walking in a cane or wheelchair 

Or a Down Syndrome or something more visible 

Like I don't have those conditions I'm still disabled as them 

Autism you can't see, learning disabilities you can't see

Even some physical illnesses are invisible 

Such as Sickle Cell and Lupus 

Everything is not visible like blindness 

But my mental illness effects my life as much as any other disability effects people lives in society 

Just because I have muscle or tall black and 6'2""

Keep myself groomed 

I guess I have to look unhoused to For people to understand how my disability effects me seriously 

It's so flawed 

Invisible Disabilities doesn't work like that unfortunately 

I'm deserving of disability as much as anyone that has a disability 

Sorry for the rant OP
Absolutely. I'm tired of the nonsense that mental health disabilities are less disabling or acceptable than physical.

Ugh, nothing like having someone tell you that you can't wallow feeling sorry for yourself.    Yes, another person with a disability. 

Like, listen jackass, I literally became disabled overnight at 51 years old.  My old life and career are over.    Both my brother and father died in long, drawn-out illnesses right before and after.   My dad literally died 7 months after becoming disabled.     It takes some f***ing time to process.  Three years later, I still wake up shocked.  It's hard navigating a new life coupled with grief.   

I'm bipolar and work hard to maintain my mental health.

Sorry.   Hits me right in the feels.


One of the most influential people in my life was Eric Gallegos, though I called him Pete. I met him when we both worked at a movie theater called Krikorian Theaters in Redlands, California. Pete was ten years older than me, and he played a significant role in bringing out the musical artist and writer within me.

At the time, I was a clean-cut, plain kid with no radical style. Pete, on the other hand, was the original goth-emo type—dark and poetic, yet incredibly down-to-earth, intelligent, fit, and usually happy-go-lucky. Despite the age difference, we became close friends, and even ten years later, we remained in touch.

Around that time, Pete had just gone through a tough divorce from his newlywed wife, which also led to a separation from his baby daughter. I was looking for a new place to live, so I moved in with him. Those were dark days for Pete as he coped with the loss and loneliness. He was a trip, I tell you. He even figured out how to loop the DVD player, so ""Fight Club"" played 24/7 in our living room. At one point, he kissed his hand, poured lye on it, and gave himself a real chemical burn—just like in the movie.

While living with Pete, I was also developing a serious relationship with a young woman who was studying at UC Santa Cruz. The long distance made things difficult at times, and when the relationship hit hurdles, I didn’t always handle the grief and rejection well. But Pete was always there for me. He validated my pain, empathized with me, and pushed me to turn my suffering into motivation for creativity.

The best advice he ever gave me came during one of my lowest moments. After listening to me complain and cry for as long as I needed, Pete finally looked at me and said, ""Embrace the suck."" At the time, I didn’t fully understand it. He explained what he meant, but I took it as a way to bandage up the pain and move on.

It wasn’t until my mental health worsened—after several suicide attempts, years of hospitalizations, therapy, and constant recovery—that I began to truly grasp the meaning of Pete's words. I realized I had been bottling up emotions I wasn’t even aware of. Simply dealing with the pain only made it come back tenfold, eventually leading me to the brink of taking my own life.

Then, during the COVID-19 pandemic, my world fell apart again. The Social Security Administration terminated my benefits, leaving me homeless. I ended up living in my car on the streets of Seattle, a city that had become lawless during the pandemic. Every day was a struggle just to stay alive, and I was constantly on edge, fearing for my safety.

During this time, Pete’s first daughter, whom I had met when she was eight years old and had reconnected with over Facebook, reached out to me. I’ll never forget the message she sent. I was dealing with the daily challenges of living in my car, battling despair and uncertainty, when she told me, ""Daddy died."" Pete, my friend since I was 18, the person who had been a guiding light in my life, had passed away from a heart attack at the age of 52. I hadn’t seen him since I was 30, and now he was gone.

I never got the chance to tell Pete how much his words, ""Embrace the suck,"" had become a life support for me, especially during those dark times. I miss him deeply. His voice still comes to me in my darkest moments—when I’m heartbroken, depressed, disappointed, feeling worthless, or hurt by someone. I completely ""embrace the suck."" I live it, letting it fully affect my emotional state. I allow myself to feel the pain completely until it’s gone. I even set deadlines to cut the crap if it lingers too long, but I always give the pain a place to exist.

I use this approach when someone hurts me or when I’m full of self-hate for messing up. I let myself feel just how awful the situation is and connect with the source of that pain. This way, I understand how deeply it affects me, and it becomes a motivation to avoid that pain in the future. If someone repeatedly hurts me, I eventually reach a point where I never want to experience that pain again, leading me to set boundaries and remove that person from my life. If it’s something I’ve done to myself, the memory of the suffering helps me decide not to make the same mistake again.",severe ptsd really struggle forced positivity people less pervasive mental health issue im glad stuff solved cbt app exercise beyond bro ugh nothing like someone tell cant wallow feeling sorry yes another person disability like listen jackass literally became disabled overnight year old old life career brother father died long drawnout illness right dad literally died month becoming disabled take fing time process three year later still wake shocked hard navigating new life coupled grief im bipolar work hard maintain mental health anyone say something like fuck right sorry hit right feel one influential people life eric gallegos though called pete met worked movie theater called krikorian theater redlands california pete ten year older played significant role bringing musical artist writer within time cleancut plain kid radical style pete hand original gothemo typedark poetic yet incredibly downtoearth intelligent fit usually happygolucky despite age difference became close friend even ten year later remained touch around time pete gone tough divorce newlywed wife also led separation baby daughter looking new place live moved dark day pete coped loss loneliness trip tell even figured loop dvd player fight club played living room one point kissed hand poured lye gave real chemical burnjust like movie living pete also developing serious relationship young woman studying uc santa cruz long distance made thing difficult time relationship hit hurdle didnt always handle grief rejection well pete always validated pain empathized pushed turn suffering motivation creativity best advice ever gave came one lowest moment listening complain cry long needed pete finally looked said embrace suck time didnt fully understand explained meant took way bandage pain move wasnt mental health worsenedafter several suicide attempt year hospitalization therapy constant recoverythat began truly grasp meaning petes word realized bottling emotion wasnt even aware simply dealing pain made come back tenfold eventually leading brink taking life covid pandemic world fell apart social security administration terminated benefit leaving homeless ended living car street seattle city become lawless pandemic every day struggle stay alive constantly edge fearing safety time petes first daughter met eight year old reconnected facebook reached ill never forget message sent dealing daily challenge living car battling despair uncertainty told daddy died pete friend since person guiding light life passed away heart attack age hadnt seen since gone never got chance tell pete much word embrace suck become life support especially dark time miss deeply voice still come darkest momentswhen im heartbroken depressed disappointed feeling worthless hurt someone completely embrace suck live letting fully affect emotional state allow feel pain completely gone even set deadline cut crap lingers long always give pain place exist use approach someone hurt im full selfhate messing let feel awful situation connect source pain way understand deeply affect becomes motivation avoid pain future someone repeatedly hurt eventually reach point never want experience pain leading set boundary remove person life something ive done memory suffering help decide make mistake,negative,0.175,0.562,0.263,-0.9957,0.14713555574417114,0.4787040650844574,0.37416037917137146,negative

p0052,popular,mh_wp,Why are people needlessly cruel to those of us with invisible disabilities? ,258,disability,"You need to block these people. Right now the world is experiencing a rise in extreme rightwing ideologies, particularly the F one. These ideologies emphasize physical strength and condemn weakness. It is a form of brainwashing. One US presidential candidate told his nephew to let his disabled son die; as former president, he packed his administration with eugenicists. 

Lots of people have internalized these beliefs bc of the constant onslaught on social media by bots and disinformation; other people attend prosperity gospel churches where the same message is hammered in. Their god prefers the Uberman; mental health issues are caused by demons. The cult of Ayn Rand glorifies selfishness and greed, and Calvinist theology reinforces it.

Feminists say “the personal is political.” The converse is true as well—the political becomes personal. People absorb this propaganda and start to believe it themselves. Even people who consider themselves “liberal” will treat disabled people like shit. I am estranged from two of my siblings for this reason. Outwardly they are all about supporting liberal causes, such as helping refugees, but they will call me “lazy” and “crazy.” 

It can be helpful emotionally to get involved in disability advocacy and counteract these negative ideologies. Online, it’s all about language use and framing. You can learn to spot negative language and replace it with positive by focusing on positive values. George Lakoff is a linguist and cognitive scientist who explains how the human brain uses metaphors to frame the world. In his book [Don’t Think of an Elephant](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/dont-think-of-an-elephant-know-your-values-and-frame-the-debate-the-essential-guide-for-progressives_george-lakoff/263729/item/27240142/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=high_vol_frontlist_standard_shopping_retention&utm_adgroup=&utm_term=&utm_content=698403107263&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADwY45jsPFVpxuJXUsfn92woJIeYH&gclid=Cj0KCQjwh7K1BhCZARIsAKOrVqF_qxm3JKj9QntgsSZR178cHEKuYhUOfKSZvid0A9aLo1E0Bni1JP4aAoY9EALw_wcB#idiq=27240142&edition=8081469) he explains how the Right creates and spreads the harmful disinformation you experience on social media. He also teaches how to combat it, by reframing. Focus on the values of empathy and compassion. Actively correct people by using different words. 

But you also need to block the negativity and seek out positivity.
Ever since a toddler I have picked my fingers and still do, so for 40 years I have picked them till they bleed and afterwards i get embarrassed and shamed. This is from a trauma as a baby that caused a permanent bruise mass on my upper lip from being held incorrectly and bashing my lip on my dad tooth, after this my mum said I started picking my fingers, being shy nervous and not wanting to go to school because felt sick. She said she took me to doctors and the doctor prescribed medication for heartburn and indigestion to settle tummy, and put plasters on fingers!! She just thought I was shy and nervous and not mentally traumatised by the accident so don’t know in 1983/5 how help with these symptoms in the UK were diagnosed. It took 20 years to get an anxiety diagnosis and another 10 to say it’s agoraphobia and a disability. As you do research of other symptoms of anxiety because not sure if it’s normal behaviour or due to anxiety I’m so confused with results. I’m a shamed of my past because of the things I did as a teenager like unprotected intercourse with different men, dangerous driving, moody, frustrated, always arguing with parents self destructive actions, failed relationships, could stay in job, struggled with every day life every single thing is so difficult for me, at school couldn’t concentrate so had low grades, always takes me longer to learn things . My parents were very protective of me because of bullying from my lip appearance so I had always had all my battles and problems for me so I never developed that action and still struggle with this to day as someone else has always done that for me which is my husband now. until I was 18 that’s when these started to happen I thought it might be retaliation of being controlled but it is because I had not been allowed to learn by own experiences so after research of why I have these behaviours because I was shamed of my actions afterwards and would pick my fingers for hours and have dark thoughts to get relief from all the pain and fear and worries and frustration I was sort of relieved it is to do with the trauma I suffered as a child, I never told anyone this before not even a councillor because of worrying about what people would think which I have since the traumatic experience. But now that mental health is becoming more known I have been told it’s 4 years wait for a full Psychiatric Evaluation, or pay private of £600. I have had 5 CBT sessions and not helped just made me more frustrated as was just told do these things but I try and get frustrated 😣. I lost friends because I never know how to be one I struggle with peoples emotions and can’t express emotions as from having to attend my grand parents funerals I felt nothing I actually smiled and had to force to cry to show people I did care I was embarrassed of my actions I think the medication has stopped this more than use to. People thought I was nasty, rude self centred selfish person and would be avoid and not included or invited always choosen last in PE like the movies, my parents said it’s who I was like!!! They still don’t understand and never helped me so not seen them 5 years, can anyone help with explaining why I am like this? And any help with dealing with own experiences would be very appreciated. Thank you for listening 🥰
Can relate to this so much. I have mental health issues after trauma and since being out of crisis state from my ptsd, my family think I’m ’ok now’.

I’m not. I mask. Every single day. I deal with it all the time just underneath the surface. 

I also have some disabling medical conditions. I don’t even tell them when it’s affecting me as I’d never shit up.
I always get shunned for smiling or having fun or being relaxed when say about my mental health, my parents or friends didn’t understand my pain or disability, smiling was my disguise 🥸 so they thought I was ok so didn’t worry about me. As soon as you start showing some symptoms it’s like your lying 🤥 or they over mother cuddle you like I am about to die. They don’t know what to do so I just mask it to avoid that with close friends and family, so can understand completely about being asked if need help all the time and how suffocating it can be as you sometimes feel like voiding places but why should we, but I also get the opposite when out and about because If I have an anxiety attack because of the place and situation it’s like I’m contagious because people don’t understand what’s happening and that it’s a disability. People either leave or stare or whisper so makes me even more anxious so just Avoid going out altogether because this causes anxiety just thinking about having to go out and most of the time it causes so much distress I can’t go out and end up cancelling appointments because of other people’s actions. It seems If you’re in a wheelchair your incapable of doing anything and if you aren’t in a wheelchair it’s your very capable as can’t see your inner pain and struggling with it. Because of some peoples lack of understanding and actions and thought processes around disability we have these problems so Until they stuffer them selves they will never know. I really appreciate all the help for us but it’s the people who don’t understand need to be educated more.
PIP because I can’t travel alone in public transport or using sat nav in a car without help I have to have someone with me or just a simple journey to shop without support because of my anxiety I can’t leaving the home alone as having a panic attack and being around people alone causes my anxiety to cause me disoriented this is caused from my work causing this from accusing me from being on holiday when off for mental health.
Aww 🥰 it’s very worrying with what is going on, yeah I try not to read the news. I’m glad you have an out let that works for you. My fear is other peoples opinions and thoughts of how I come across because of my mother always criticising my appearance, my weight or hair style or clothing so I cut ties with my family. My husband is my safety net he understands. My agoraphobia came from work when they accusing me for using my mental health as to get time off to go on holiday, it made it worse as now I can’t go out as I think people are judging me for going out and having fun when I have mental health like we are supposed to be miserable looking all the time and also in case I bump into my family I’m constantly looking over my shoulder even though moved far away.
Oh bless you hun. It’s so hard when our self esteem has been chipped away so much that there is so little left to support ourselves. Thank god for your wonderful husband, just having one person in your corner can sometimes be a huge difference. 

Around the time of my health diagnosis and the trauma I was also being emotionally abused by my narcissistic SIL. I cannot describe how much she destroyed me. Bit by bit. Death by a million papercuts. She did it so covertly that my partner didn’t even believe me until he saw it. Obviously he was so upset he didn’t see it in time and it had been going on for years. We are now also no contact with his family, but that’s a very long story.

My mind has blanked out some parts of this time period but I just remember coming home from work (I worked with my SIL) and just crumbling in the corner of the kitchen and just wanting to not exist anymore. I couldn’t understand why someone wanted to hurt me and hate me so much when I’d done everything I could to include her in our lives and the kids lives.

I also remember falling through my mums front door crying the day of the thing that happened but again bits are lost. 

Six years late, I’m still trying to put myself together. 

If it wasn’t for my partner and our kids, I wouldn’t be here. 

He has made me fall in love with him even more,  a hundred fold more than I ever thought possible for being the most amazing human being and helping me recover. Funding thousands of pounds worth of therapy and never once judging me. I thank the stars every day for this man. 

I don’t think we will ever be the same again hun. But we can rebuild as better versions of ourselves. 

The only good thing to come from it all was, for me, it humbled me. 

I’ve always tried to be a kind person, it’s probably my biggest value I hold but I did used to be judgy of people in my head. I remember thinking about someone I knew who said they had anxiety and thinking ‘what the hell have you got to be anxious about’. 

I’m so ashamed to admit that I thought that. I had no idea what hidden battle they were fighting. No idea the depth of damage mental health could cause. 

I’ve made it my mission to educate myself on mental health. To learn tools to help and share my knowledge. 

My daughter has recently been diagnosed with severe OCD and I think maybe what happened to me happened to prepare me to help and understand my daughter’s battle and to help me grow as a person.
It’s just so bad you have to feel like that, that you need to prove yourself of having a disability people cant see, wheelchair users don’t choose to be in a wheelchair because they want to be, they choose to be in a wheelchair because they NEED to be for support or safety when getting around. But If you aren’t permanently in a wheelchair your also get classed as not being disabled or lying because you can either walk or get up, being made to feel you are more understood in a wheelchair than not being in one just proves the ignorance and stupidity of people who are self centred of disabilities of any sort. People who do fake disabilities because they feel they need it for sympathy or likes or ego boost are the ones to cause the problems of people not understanding mental health and disability and when they are real. Why do people think that having a disability when they don’t gives them the idea you have the advantages or a passage to a easy life and being centre of attention when you are disabled for real it’s like their jealous of us so pretend to be so can get the attention!!!! If they just knew the real pain and heart ache that comes with it, but the so called advantages and attention they think it is isn’t too us they just use our disability for own agains, back when the asylums where opened it was different my granddad was in one for his schizophrenia when he was 21 after being in the army guarding Scotland castle, he started to show signs so was put into one and the stories aren’t nice. I knew my granddad as a kind happy person.  Us kids my siblings was shielded from his past by my mum so wasn’t till we were much older did we find out, although mum was not the one to tell us she was embarrassed of his mental illness it was my grandma who told us as she noticed my anxiety and could understand me and explained grandad, I asked about my grandad to my mum for my own curiosity of having a mental illness and she just shut me out and pretended I wasn’t mentally ill either she denied it to her self making me feel unloved, I haven’t seen my family for 5 years because of my mental health for my own health I had leave so my husband and his family are my family and fully accept me. I use to wish every day to be different to be normal understood but that doesn’t exist.

p0053,popular,mh_wp,It is not appropriate to tell people whether or not they can use a mobility aid.,254,disability,"From what I’ve seen most of these “can I use a mobility aid?” Questions are people who are experiencing enough pain/difficulty weight the aid that they aren’t able to engage in activities they want. That is exactly what mobility aids are for, to enable people to do the activities they wouldn’t be able to do otherwise (or would feel significant pain/discomfort). 

There is a difference between being “disabled” and having a “disability” though which some people don’t seem to realise. “Disabled” as a legal definition refers specifically to people who struggle to carry out daily living or mobility activities without equipment.

A “disability” can be anything that makes a specific task harder, and does not need to actually limit your ability to live. 
For example dyslexia is a disability, if you’re in work or education you might need extra support or equipment, but the vast majority of people with dyslexia will not classify as disabled.
Someone who’s elderly might be perfectly able day to day but would struggle with a big trip so might use a wheelchair or scooter temporarily. They aren’t disabled, but the use of mobility equipment can still enable them in certain contexts.

Obviously anyone who’s using equipment unnecessarily because they want attention or to be part of a protected group is completely in the wrong. 
However, it’s an extremely small minority of people who might do this. Evidence suggests that people under report disability and equipment is used less than it should be. Stigma against people using equipment is huge, and equipment is cumbersome, it’s not some fun ride and anyone who doesn’t need it and doesn’t have significant mental health issues is unlikely to keep using it long.

So for the most part telling people “if you think it’d help you live your life then you’re the judge” is not likely to be problematic. Gatekeeping equipment is far more likely to cause issues. Most people don’t act they luxury of waiting for mobility equipment to be prescribed either. It took me 2 years to get a wheelchair prescribed, and I’ll still have to self fund most of it. Those 2 years after years of being housebound I’ve been able to live a full life and get back to work because I went ahead and got myself a small mobility scooter.",ive seen use mobility aid question people experiencing enough paindifficulty weight aid arent able engage activity want exactly mobility aid enable people activity wouldnt able otherwise would feel significant paindiscomfort difference disabled disability though people dont seem realise disabled legal definition refers specifically people struggle carry daily living mobility activity without equipment disability anything make specific task harder need actually limit ability live example dyslexia disability youre work education might need extra support equipment vast majority people dyslexia classify disabled someone who elderly might perfectly able day day would struggle big trip might use wheelchair scooter temporarily arent disabled use mobility equipment still enable certain context obviously anyone who using equipment unnecessarily want attention part protected group completely wrong however extremely small minority people might evidence suggests people report disability equipment used less stigma people using equipment huge equipment cumbersome fun ride anyone doesnt need doesnt significant mental health issue unlikely keep using long part telling people think itd help live life youre judge likely problematic gatekeeping equipment far likely cause issue people dont act luxury waiting mobility equipment prescribed either took year get wheelchair prescribed ill still self fund year year housebound ive able live full life get back work went ahead got small mobility scooter,positive,0.128,0.805,0.067,0.8781,0.048689279705286026,0.6209733486175537,0.33033737540245056,negative

They should have someone filling in while she is off. Also, report rights violations to their recipients right attorney. Group homes can be a great option, but this one sounds terrible.
I live in a SNF, I've been here since the beginning of September. The food is around 70% awful. Most of it seems to be canned or frozen, over salted, under seasoned, or just tastes gross. The soup is usually the Campbell's condensed kind and a few times it was barely thinned out. I think the eggs are powdered and they are almost always wet. I don't know how else to describe them, but it's just gross. I keep having to order from Grubhub because I cannot stomach what they give me. The nurses and CNA's are nice to me, but I feel like one of the ladies in social services doesn't like me because I can speak up for myself and what's going on.  She ignored me for weeks when I wanted to change rooms. The other patients though, a lot of them do not belong in a nursing facility, but either in a memory care facility or a mental health facility. Some are verbally abusive to the staff. They yell, scream, and curse at them. They will shout out their demands over and over instead of hitting their call light and waiting their turn. The staff here are not trained to deal withse types of patients. Then there are the physically abusive ones who hit the staff and throw things. And the staff are basically told to put up with it. It's disgusting. And they are way understaffed. 10+ patients for 1 CNA sometimes. I've thought about contacting someone, but it needs to be through email as I don't want anyone to hear what I have to say.
You need to reach out to your social worker and DEMAND to be moved! I am currently living in medical foster care as a charge of the state (I have a significant TBI that left me with a significant cognitive impairment and anger control issues, I’m also a paraplegic, I have refractory [uncontrolled despite being on 3 meds at once] epilepsy which is how I became paralyzed and got my TBI in the first place, I have severe agoraphobia and anxiety disorders along with OCD and depression, I’ve also got autism and severe ADHD.), and when I finally decided to relieve my family of the burden of caring for me by leaving the family home and going into the custody of the state, I made it VERY clear that I was NOT going to go into a group home setting or a “facility” of any kind. I told her that I would only accept a medical foster care situation (Because the point of the foster care setting is that it is a HOME based setting. You literally move into a regular family home, where a family or an individual who has gone through all of the necessary medical and foster care training and continuing education is supposed to treat you like part of the family, albeit one with whatever special needs that the social workers have asked them to manage, assist with, or simply observe.), and that I even had already picked out the foster home and foster guardian I wanted to move in with. I was lucky enough timing wise, that one of my close friends who runs a medical/cognitive health foster home had just kicked out his last client a few months before, so he held off on accepting any new clients until my social worker could place me in his foster home all by myself. No other clients with me here! It has been working pretty well so far, though inevitably when a friendship adds in a caretaking and business aspect to it, there are ALWAYS going to be some growing pains. Lol. Obviously you probably don’t just randomly have a friend who happens to provide the exact type of care that you need at the exact moment that you need in, which I really wish you did so that you could get out of there right away! BUT, I tell you all of this to tell you that it sounds like medical adult foster care sounds like it is exactly where you should have been placed instead of the hellscape you are currently in. So PLEASE call your social worker immediately to report the abuses you have been subjected to and DEMAND to be moved IMMEDIATELY, and that you will only accept a foster care/family setting. Because of the fact that you are being abused, you should be able to forgo the 30/60 day notice of breaking your tenancy at the group home (or however many days your state mandates/whatever your lease or contract with the group home mandates). Go online to look up the number for reporting vulnerable adult abuse by a DHS provider, and call ASAP to get the ball rolling on a proper report of the abuses and mistreatment you are suffering from. ESPECIALLY the suddenly watching you bathing thing, which sounds really sexual assault/harassment-y to me! If it was not on your cares sheet that you saw and signed at the beginning of your stay in the home that you needed to be supervised for your safety in the bathroom/tub, there is ZERO excuse why a staff member should be watching you bathe! Make sure you voice your discomfort with this situation ESPECIALLY with both the DHS reporting line AND your social worker! (I have to be supervised in the shower due to my epilepsy having nearly killed me in the shower more than once, but even that doesn’t mean someone STARES at me while I shower!!! WTF?! My friend just sits on my wheelchair reading articles about gaming and stuff like that while I shower with the shower curtain fully closed. He’s there close enough to hear if I start having a seizure and act quickly enough to hopefully prevent me from hurting myself, or if I need help with something I can call out to him and ask him to grab a thing and give it to me, or something like that. I NEVER would’ve signed my care contract if it had said that I needed to be WATCHED with eyeballs the whole time I bathed! No way!) You may have some mental health struggles, but you sound MORE than competent to make decisions as to how you wish to have your cares completed and as to where you’d desire to be placed while you get better. (Because, let’s face it, NO ONE gets better while being abused and underfed! Honestly, your lunchtime looks worse than the slop we got in the school cafeteria!!! Yuck!) There is absolutely ZERO reason, based on how you’ve presented yourself and your living situation here, as to why you should be left to continue suffering in that madness! I wish you all the best, and I really hope that you are able to get out of there quickly! Hopefully I was able to help, at least a little…. If you have any questions about how to present your arguments to your social worker, or if your social worker doesn’t listen to you, feel free to reach out to me, and I’ll do what I can to help! I can also ask my friend who is my foster guardian what steps you could take and who else to contact if you’d like me to!

America has so many problems with mental health care that it actually worsens my depression.
I see you have BPD too OP, dealing with the lowest common denominator of mental health professionals while borderline is FUCKING HORRIFIC. I was fortunate to be able to access DBT while I still could, but these days I feel like a robot that hasn't been tuned up in forever. Now all that ever happens is I get treated like a drug-seeker or outright abused if I seek help. My most recent inpatient stays I was there both times because I wanted to die because my mom passed away in 2015 and then my house burned down a couple of months later, and both times I had the same psychiatrist assigned to me, who completely ignored that I show serious signs of PTSD from being a caregiver to a cancer patient and surviving a fire, tried to diagnose me with autism and accused me of being addicted to whatever meds I happened to be using for anxiety at the time. Now I'm permanently banned from benzos when I have absolutely debilitating anxiety (and despite that I only took my klonopin like twice a week tops, I feel MUCH better just knowing I have the option), and all that does now is force me to self-medicate, which just leads me to being accused of drug seeking again! 
There is a debate on whether suicide is selfish. I do think suicide is selfish, but I don't think being selfish is a bad thing. We're all selfish to an extent. When a person is committing suicide they are in a place of hell and want to escape. The people who don't want them to commit suicide are usually concerned about their own feelings around death rather than the persons suffering. Yes there is mental health treatment, but it's hard to access. There aren't many good psychiatrists available, especially those that take insurance. Even then you get comments like ""What do you have to be depressed about. You're in a 1st world country."" ""Everyone is a little bit OCD"" ""Medication should be a last resort."" ""She's bipolar. One minute she's happy the next minute she's angry."" ""You look fine to me."" ""Every teen does that."" Heck people are called drug seeking for seeking non\-controlled medication to help them. Until we start taking mental health seriously, we have no right to complain about suicide.
I think this might be overstating it a bit, but I also happen to live in one of the most liberal regions of the country, so maybe I'm just spoiled. We definitely suck compared to other developed nations on healthcare coverage, especially mental healthcare. It's still so stigmatized that people I work with who come to me at the independent living center are often very reluctant to share their disability when it's part of what we ask after (they're entitled to not disclose and I respect that right fully, just wish people hadn't become so conditioned to treat behavioral health as this weird taboo.)
God that is so fucking awful! Yeah, they really don't know shit about mental health. I was diagnosed with CPTSD when I was put on an involuntary hold, and they didn't try to help me at all?  Like I got 3 sessions of therapy, and they were like, ""That's probably enough to combat the years of abuse!"" I want to be hospitalized, but it is so hit or miss, and the chances of me actually getting help are soooooo low.
Trying to get help for prolonged abuse is honestly really difficult, and not just in America. My partner's from the UK and while the NHS exists, some areas are just total shit for mental health. Almost every time he started a new therapy and told me what they were doing, they were doing it completely wrong. Not just differently from what I know, straight up wrong. They would end EMDR sessions without going through the safe space thing. They didn't even set up a mental safe space for him if I remember correctly, which is crucial if a session ends in the middle of processing a high stress situation.  
The first time I did a few asshole moves to get assigned to a different doctor, and the same asshole moves put me on suicide watch.

I always feel guilty about being disabled and getting SSI benefits thanks to people who pay taxes in my country.

It's like I want to prove that the economical effort people do for my sake is not going to waste.

This leads to getting burnt out because of trying arduously to get a job or study and just not being able to.

""Your job is surviving. That SSI benefits you're getting are your monthly pay for your survival task.""

My mother and I are in a pretty abusive love-hate relationship and I want to emancipate so we can't hurt each other anymore, but the SSI benefits are not enough for that and the more time I spend in this house, the worse my condition gets.

And that affects my studies and job seeking, which are the factors that could let me emancipate. It's an ouroboros situation.

I think the SSI benefits should fill the economical needs we disabled people need without having to relay on relatives: rent, energy, food, medical bills, special education, and maybe some basic leisure like sports, outings, books, etc.

I mean... it's not a whim, right? We didn't choose to be disabled. I think we have the right to get help to live peacefully. We already have it very difficult because of our disabilities, isn't it?

Of course, if we improve and become able to study and work, we will immediately want to try and do our best! Because nobody feels good being neet and getting excluded from everything in life...

&#x200B;

I'm sorry about what I'm going to say, but sometimes...

...It feels like it's not worth to live like this, always being escrutinized by rude people, like poor OP has felt today, even with all the titanic efforts they do everyday.

Or always depending on a relative and not having anywhere to go or anything to do, in my case, while every non-disabled friend or classmate is doing much better.

You are awesome, OP and everyone here.
I feel you. My physical limitations are pretty mild, but my mental health disabilities make things very challenging. 



Most days are a struggle to get out of bed. My dog helps a lot with this, and he physically forces me out of the bed if it's a really bad day. Each day I track my ADLs to review with my counselor each week. If I comb my hair and brush my teeth every day, it's a really good week. 



In addition to the daily grind, each week I have a ketamine treatment. I have to find transportation to and from because I can't drive for the rest of the day. I spend 2 hours at the doctor's office under medical supervision after they give me the meds. I also have counseling every week. 




Once a month I go to the hospital for an ECT treatment. It takes an hour to get there in good weather. Usually I'm at the hospital for about 4 hours. The treatment itself is short, but it takes a while to get checked in, hooked up for anesthesia, and recover afterwards.",pretty bad relationship mother sometimes say useful thing like exact thing said always feel guilty disabled getting ssi benefit thanks people pay tax country like want prove economical effort people sake going waste lead getting burnt trying arduously get job study able xb day told feeling said job surviving ssi benefit youre getting monthly pay survival task mental health issue think physical disabled folk feel like xb mother pretty abusive lovehate relationship want emancipate cant hurt anymore ssi benefit enough time spend house worse condition get affect study job seeking factor could let emancipate ouroboros situation xb think ssi benefit fill economical need disabled people need without relay relative rent energy food medical bill special education maybe basic leisure like sport outing book etc mean whim right didnt choose disabled think right get help live peacefully already difficult disability isnt course improve become able study work immediately want try best nobody feel good neet getting excluded everything life xb im sorry im going say sometimes feel like worth live like always escrutinized rude people like poor op felt today even titanic effort everyday always depending relative anywhere go anything case every nondisabled friend classmate much better awesome op everyone feel physical limitation pretty mild mental health disability make thing challenging day struggle get bed dog help lot physically force bed really bad day day track adls review counselor week comb hair brush teeth every day really good week addition daily grind week ketamine treatment find transportation cant drive rest day spend hour doctor office medical supervision give med also counseling every week month go hospital ect treatment take hour get good weather usually im hospital hour treatment short take get checked hooked anesthesia recover afterwards,positive,0.258,0.628,0.114,0.9934,0.0403541699051857,0.727636992931366,0.23200877010822296,negative

It was treated with a few weeks of IV antibiotics but I have a lot of residual brain damage like balance problems, problems with loud noises, mania/depression, and paranoia.
I have fibromyalgia and Dyxpraxia on top of mental health issues.
My disabilities are mental health, psychiatric and developmental (autism) + a physical disability that’s mostly improved but how it is now is likely permanent damage

Some of my symptoms aren’t diagnosed yet but are disabling. But I consider those separate from the list above due to the lack of diagnosis

My most notable are: 

Officially diagnosed: Persistent depressive disorder, 2 Anxiety Disorders, CPTSD, migraines 

Symptoms with no diagnosis: Hallucinations (smell, touch, verbal, noise and visual), panic attacks, mild confusion, mind fog, memory issues

It used to be so much worse and it could easily get that bad again :(
I also have CVID, fibromyalgia, seizures, and a multitude of mental health issues. I've passed my bad genes onto my kids which I can't help but feel guilty about. My Dr is currently testing me for lupus which I really hope I don't have. I really don't need another diagnosis right now lol.
absolutely. and the ways and reasons for why our disabilities are so difficult aren’t the same either! for someone like me, my disability is a challenge because of itself. supports and mental health advances can be helpful, but there’s a certain degree of “shitty” that’s always gonna be there, so I’d personally much rather not have this disability. disabilities that are associated with things like chronic pain are likely often a similar case; the difficulty is self-sustaining.

on the other hand, disabilities like being Deaf or having autism are more complicated in their challenges. I’ve met many folks with these disabilities who say that the most difficult part is access - living in a world that is unprepared and unwilling to meet their needs, even though it’s possible to do so. so, they view the core difficulties as being more external. a sort of, “my disability is only labelled that because the world doesn’t want to accept anything that isn’t cookie-cutter,” and I totally understand that mentality!

obviously not everyone with those specific disabilities feels that way, but it’s a sentiment that’s there. these are also really big differences in the lived experience that different folks with disabilities have.",diagnosed neurosyphilis mental health issue treated week iv antibiotic lot residual brain damage like balance problem problem loud noise maniadepression paranoia fibromyalgia dyxpraxia top mental health issue disability mental health psychiatric developmental autism physical disability thats mostly improved likely permanent damage symptom arent diagnosed yet disabling consider separate list due lack diagnosis notable officially diagnosed persistent depressive disorder anxiety disorder cptsd migraine symptom diagnosis hallucination smell touch verbal noise visual panic attack mild confusion mind fog memory issue used much worse could easily get bad also cvid fibromyalgia seizure multitude mental health issue ive passed bad gene onto kid cant help feel guilty dr currently testing lupus really hope dont really dont need another diagnosis right lol absolutely way reason disability difficult arent either someone like disability challenge support mental health advance helpful there certain degree shitty thats always gonna id personally much rather disability disability associated thing like chronic pain likely often similar case difficulty selfsustaining hand disability like deaf autism complicated challenge ive met many folk disability say difficult part access living world unprepared unwilling meet need even though possible view core difficulty external sort disability labelled world doesnt want accept anything isnt cookiecutter totally understand mentality obviously everyone specific disability feel way sentiment thats also really big difference lived experience different folk disability,negative,0.139,0.617,0.245,-0.9816,0.033159926533699036,0.7544345259666443,0.21240559220314026,negative

I came out of teenage hood disabled with no diagnosis due to my family just deciding obviously I was 'lazy'. It didn't matter that I was unable to get up for 20hrs a day from 13 onwards.

I'm still fighting for help from the system and it in itself is exhausting. My job is exhausting. Consistently explaining to my workplace that 'no I cannot take on more work' is just too much.
 I'm under paid in my field which is probably the only reason they haven't fired me over this. 

The worst part is that I love working and really rather work than sit in bed in pain on a bad day. Time, and the pain, just pass faster when you have something to do.
honestly i was just about to make a post about a similar sentiment. a lot of my family friends/family are disabled but can work and they are so sure that i should be able to push through what im going through to make it work. that pain is better than being reliant on other people. the reality is i can barely walk, i have several other physical health issues at any given time, and my mental health is so fragile that i just cant handle pressure. there isnt a job that exists for someone like me and of there did id love to have it just so people would stop looking down on me so much.

not to mention, most of those folks are barely holding it together and throw their health into chaos by constantly pushing themselves. some people have to but a lot of the people i know are too proud even just to lighten their workload.

p0059,popular,mh_wp,Discourse? ADHD as disability ,222,disability,"You're wrong about one assumption, and that's the assumption that ADHD is a mental health disorder. It's not. It's a developmental disability that's also neurological. And physically disabling someone isn't the only way to disable someone. 

Combined type ADHD is typically the type that makes someone unable to work and require disability, but the other two types can do this as well. ADHD impacts basic functioning and can prevent you from doing tasks. ADHD causes ""time blindness,"" which is when someone can't feel the passage of time. Two hours could pass, but the person with time blindness would think that only 15 minutes had passed, so ADHD literally takes away our sense of time. There's also ADHD Paralysis, where the body is paralyzed and can't move because the brain is too overwhelmed with stress, the environment (a messy room, for example), or exhaustion. 

ADHD takes over the entire brain and body. It makes life harder and puts those of us with it at a disadvantage. That's honestly just a few reasons why it's a disability. 

I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Congenital Heart Disease, Autism, and other physical and mental disabilities but my ADHD is still one that I struggle with the most even though it was my first diagnosis. 

I hope that helped.
Diagnosed with ADHD last year, DID last year, and bipolar 2 the year before. My ADHD was the last thing to be diagnosed to treated and being on medication has changed it from disabling my life to being manageable. There are a lot of factors. It was making treatment or commitment to any of my other mental health issues impossible. 

Some people may have “mild” ADHD and not consider it disabling. When I can’t get up to go to the bathroom, get to a therapy appointment, or take my meds because of executive dysfunction it impacts my entire body/life. My focus used to be all over the place and I’d fall asleep constantly. 

So I think compounded with any other mental health issues or physical health issues then yeah it makes a persons disabled.
Technically, I guess that's right. Sometimes it's used often incorrectly as an umbrella term for learning disabilities though a lot of times it seems to fit. I have a strong diagnosed case of it myself, but I never considered it a disability in of itself. There are several ways to work with it (at least in my case), but I can see where some people will struggle no matter the method used. If nothing else, I have empathy with genuine cases, but it makes me cringe when people casually blame their imaginary ADHD for a rare small mistake or minor lapse in attention. Like, ""Oops, I forgot my laptop for the first time in 6 years, must be the ol' ADHD kicking in, hyuck, hyuck!"" Now I know this can differ immensely, but my experience goes something like this:

-Wake up, take my Adderall, clean myself.
-Spend too much time in the shower thinking about all the things I need to do before coming to my senses and moving on to getting dressed.
-Spend a full 5 minutes staring at my bottle of stimulants, which I've set upside down as an indicator that I did take them, to try to recall if I took them or forgot to flip the bottle right side up the night before.
-Repeat the phrase ""wallet, phone, keys, and vape"" while patting down my jacket.
-Turn my attention to the pot of coffee I forgot I made, fill my Thermos.
-Jacket on, walk to the door; freeze.
-Turn around, grab my lunch from the fridge, back to the door; freeze.
-Repeat the phrase ""wallet, phone, keys, and vape"" while patting down my jacket.
-Turn around, track down my keys... and my debit card that I just remembered I took out of my wallet last night to impulse buy something that caught my interest.
-Finally, out the door unless I see my reflection in the window as if to remind me my hair is way too messy for the office. Grab a hat, then fix it during break later.
-Walk to work, enjoy the fresh air of freedom for 10 minutes.
-Reach the door to my workplace, have a small moment of dread while frantically feeling for my security tag. Feel relief if found or like you your whole day is ruined if not.
-Reach my cubical, no one but me there and the lights are off; silent, peaceful, and the best part of my shift.
-Begin my work routine (which I've written with a timed itinerary and pinned to my wall).
-Realize how far behind I am when coworkers file in. Notice our daily webcam Teams meeting is in 5 minutes.
-Work during the meeting to catch up, retain about half the information. Meeting ran long, factory floor walkthrough with dept. heads starts in 2 minutes and I have to use the restroom. Go as quickly as possible without seeming frantic. Say an awkward ""good morning"" to any coworkers I happen to see on the way.
-I have 1 minute, shove my messy hair into a hairnet and pack it down to look decent. Head downstairs, check to see if my fly is open along the way.
-Walkthrough runs a bit long, but that's fine until my supervisor needs to ask me a few questions. He's about a minute from his next meeting and still chatting with me like a psychopath. My blood pressure goes up on his behalf, but I joy down a few notes of the minor tasks he's given me.
-It's 9AM and the Adderall is finally kicking in. Time to accomplish something of value. I work straight through lunch, I'm not even hungry due to the side effects, keep working. The only limiting factor is how long it takes to respond to my voicemails and emails.
-Recall that I had some minor tasks to complete, have to run downstairs to grab the note that lists them that I left behind. I have 1-2 hours to complete. Finish quick, go home at 3PM.
-Run back to work because I forgot my phone or something important that I put in a drawer early in the day (once or twice a week).

That's just my professional life, but obviously some days are better than others and ADHD can vary widely in severity. I wouldn't discount it as a disability, still, people seem to think I'm forgetful, quirky, a fast worker, and (ironically) laser focused all at once.
Disclaimer: *I don't have ADHD, but I do have mental health disorders that contribute to my disability*

In my opinion, I really think the term ""disability"" should be used as liberally as people would like. If they feel they are disabled, then they're disabled. I think gatekeeping the term really isn't helpful for disability rights (1) , and can cause a lot of unintentional harm (2). 

1) Obviously there's a spectrum of disability, and there can be concerns about including those who have ""less severe"" conditions as disabled. My response to that is that that's always been the case, and that that rhetoric is often used to reinforce systems of ableism. (For example, mental health disorders, other invisible disabilities being included as disabilities) Labelling yourself as disabled is such a personal thing based on your own experiences with the world around you, and I think denying someone that is really counterproductive to promoting a less ableist society. 

(Also, I think the world is so ableist and the term ""disabled"" carries so much stigma, that if there really are any """"non disabled"""" people using the term when they shouldn't, they'll be quickly weeded out)

2) I can't begin to tell you the number of people (myself included) who I've met/heard of be terrified of using the term ""disabled"" because they don't feel their condition is ""bad enough"". (Especially people who don't have stereotypical/visible disabilities) For me, the term was liberating and validating and invaluable in getting the help I need. Not using the term meant years in delayed treatment and care that I could have been using sooner. I just wouldn't want to deny anyone else that experience.

Context is important. Untreated ADHD in an educational or workplace setting can be a huge barrier and have a major impact on your life and wellbeing.

p0060,popular,mh_wp,Laughable ableism on Reddit,218,disability,"Just for clarification, is there a difference between excluding disabled and mentally ill from your consideration for dating or dating pool just because they are disabled versus knowing your needs and capabilities and that you can't manage certain challenges that come with certain conditions one has (like you won't consider being with someone who has bipolar disorder or schizophrenia because you'll feel unsafe with their instability, and you know you will have a better quality of life and have your needs met, it's what is best for you given your circumstances, and you connect better with someone who has minor mental health conditions or none at all also this is very important to you because most of your life, you didn't have the freedom to do what is best for you)?
I don't want to date someone who doesn't have coping mechanisms for their disability/mental health conditions and I don't think it's fair to do the same to others
After being in a relationship with someone with severe mental illness who physically abused me and my pets, I have a hard line now when it comes to mental illness. But only those with cluster B personality disorders who show they have a propensity for abuse. 

My mental health isn't stellar either so I know no one is perfect. I have clinical depression, ADHD, autism, and now PTSD. I've also come to the conclusion that my conditions probably make me more vulnerable to predators and it's important to learn how to protect myself from them. 
 
After what I've been through, I'm not sure if I'm being ableist. I'd like to think that I'm not, I'm just protecting myself. I guess it's a blurry line into ableism for me. 

I do find ableism abhorrent though and those who display it are to be avoided.
I don't think that's ableist at all. I think it's just a lot of awareness about the limitations your own disability creates- you know what you can and cannot offer. I have physical disabilities due to chronic pain disorders, so I could never be in a Shane & Hannah Burcaw kind of relationship. It's not that I wouldn't WANT to date someone with SMA, but I would be physically unable to provide care to them. I think you're saying something similar- it's not that you wouldn't WANT to date someone with a mental health condition, but you can't offer the support someone with similar symptoms to you would need. That's totally valid.
I also don't think it's fair to get into a relationship while knowing you're struggling with your mental health as it's a lot for the other person. I've been on the receiving end of it twice and it's horrid to be shut out because of that",clarification difference excluding disabled mentally ill consideration dating dating pool disabled versus knowing need capability cant manage certain challenge come certain condition one like wont consider someone bipolar disorder schizophrenia youll feel unsafe instability know better quality life need met best given circumstance connect better someone minor mental health condition none also important life didnt freedom best dont want date someone doesnt coping mechanism disabilitymental health condition dont think fair others relationship someone severe mental illness physically abused pet hard line come mental illness cluster b personality disorder show propensity abuse mental health isnt stellar either know one perfect clinical depression adhd autism ptsd ive also come conclusion condition probably make vulnerable predator important learn protect ive im sure im ableist id like think im im protecting guess blurry line ableism find ableism abhorrent though display avoided dont think thats ableist think lot awareness limitation disability creates know cannot offer physical disability due chronic pain disorder could never shane hannah burcaw kind relationship wouldnt want date someone sma would physically unable provide care think youre saying something similar wouldnt want date someone mental health condition cant offer support someone similar symptom would need thats totally valid also dont think fair get relationship knowing youre struggling mental health lot person ive receiving end twice horrid shut,negative,0.128,0.609,0.263,-0.9836,0.03597386181354523,0.6588991284370422,0.30512702465057373,negative
p0061,popular,mh_wp,how do you stop grieving who you could've been if not for disabilities?,215,disability,"I acquired my physical and mental health conditions in my teens and 20s and it was hard knowing my life would be more limited than most. I'm 31 now can I can't say I don't grieve for who I might have been from time to time.

I think it is very much a grieving process. I found looking at advice on losing a loved one helped. Obvs it's not the same but there's still the same sort of emotions to work through.

I battled a lot in my head in my 20s I had nearly made it. I had gotten a job I loved and although financial things were not great I felt I was finally on the way up. A year later I'd been in hospital so long I'd lost my home and didn't even have enough to buy a drink in my bank account let alone public transport to my home town. Life had really reached rock bottom. But that experience taught me something. Relationships, friendships and the interactions we have with others and the world around us are so valuable.

Although several years on I have a stable living situation I still can't do the job I loved and as I couldn't get home I ended up living in a different area away from much of my support network at the time. Since then I've started to build my life back up. I have friends who really care about me and still see some of my family. That's what matters the most to me.

Life didn't take me the way I expected and while things are likely harder I've still been able to find a few really good people to have around me and I'm getting by. My future looked rubbish when I just looked at the practical stuff like being independent and working but I forgot that there's so much more to being human than working my backside off for someone else. Plus there's people in my life who I can just sit next to. The simple act of being in their presence improves their quality of life just because they like being with me, sounds a bit mad when you think about it like that. They might do practical things for me but that makes them feel good about themselves and they get to have a bit of a giggle at my sense of humour while we are at it - I'm by no means a comedian but do like finding the funny side to stuff.
I'm 30 and have several of the conditions you do, though I wasn't diagnosed until recently. I have ADHD, GAD, HEDS, POTS, probably CPTSD, plus some other stuff with my heart and eyes. 

Like you, I also didn't graduate high school due to mental health, and I went on disability assistance right at 18. I didn't get a job until 23. 

Unfortunately, stress is only going to make everything worse, which I know in the position you are in now feels impossible to stop. My best recommendation is to really focus all you can on your health. Look for every option, insist you need it and don't wait until you feel at your worst before taking action. The sooner you can start treatment for all of these things, the better your outcome will be. 

since i wasn't diagnosed with ADHD or HEDS until i was 27/29, i spent a lot of my early 20s trying anxiety treatment after anxiety treatment, not knowing why it never made me feel much better. The moment I was treated for my ADHD I was able to get my GED and graduate from university in two years. Now that I know I have HEDS, i can better understand my limitations and work around them while also doing what i can to make sure i don't get worse(tho this is still pretty new for me)

There is a story in Greek mythology about Odysseus Needing to sail his crew past some sirens. Knowing their weakness to the creatures, he had himself and his men tie themselves to the boat as they drifted past, rather than just assuming, through force if will, they would resist them. Thanks to their preparation, they survived the encounter. 

This is just like having a disability. We have limitations and can't just walk right into situations that non disabled people can. We can, however, get to the same outcome as everyone else. We just have to do some work beforehand. This requires us to acknowledge our limits so that we can prepare for them. Odysseus was no less of a hero for acknowledging their weakness and finding a way around, and the same goes for us disabled people. 

I'm saying all this because you are young and have a lot of time to plan your strategy around what challenges you may have. It might feel like you're falling behind, but in reality, lots of people have needed to wait and prepare before jumping into their adult life. And even more rush in and end up needing to learn the same lessons later in life. It took me until my late 20s and I'm super happy now! Sure, I still live with the issues I did before, but I now have the tools to manage them.

I hope some if this helps. I know exactly what it feels like to be loosing hope and even how scary it feels to accept that there might be hope. You can 100% live a happy life despite all that seems in your way.

edit: I want to add that I don't mean by this we should be able to do everything or that we all have equal access to all resources or that this stuff is really easy. I mean that, if the end goal is happiness, accepting that we cant do some things can be the preparation we sometimes need to make in order to get there. It's OK to grieve those lost options, but don't let grief cover up other paths you can take. I have grieved who I could have been with better support, but dwelling on that doesn't really help. We live in the now, and who we are now definitely deserves our love and attention ❤️

another edit: please feel free to message me if you have any questions! I'd be happy to offer some kind of advice or point you in some directions for help.
Personally, I don't you ever stop completely grieving for what could have been. 

BUT I think what's helped me the most is one simple prayer.

 God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the strength to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. 

I don't consider myself religious and also learned that this is basically a philosophy called Stoicism. ""Stoicism teaches us to focus on the things we can control—our thoughts, emotions, and actions—while accepting the things we cannot, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us.""

We can't change our physical or mental illness, accept it and let that burden go. We can change how we react to our situation by learning ways to cope: meditation, yoga, hobbies, spending time with friends and family, medication, exercise, eating well, therapy ect. You just have to find what works for you.

 Like you I craft, it's my therapy and can even be a meditation of sorts. Focus on what you CAN do and let go of what you can't do. You're 18, you're perfect just the way you are right now. Who you can be still has endless possibilities. 

Lastly I highly recommend considering cognitive therapy if it's possible, because it's your thoughts that are draining you and causing your mental health to decline.

p0062,popular,mh_wp,"""Disabilities only exist because of society"" is an ignorant statement made to cope with internalized ableism imo",206,disability,"I consider the terms 'condition', 'impairment, and 'disability to be very different.  As an advocate for Accessibility and Accommodation in the workplace, I help the members of my grassroots community to speak with the policymakers and ensure their concerns are heard. I am not always confident that progress will happen, but we persevere.
Depends on the disability. 

Personally, my adhd is something where the problems I face are largely societal. I don’t want a “cure” for myself because I honestly don’t want to be NT. The best thing would be to build systems which are more inclusive. I’m lucky enough to be in a field and in a workplace which suits me well and can capitalize on that difference. 

But my chronic pain and joint injuries are not disabilities because of society. They’re miserable because I’m in pain and I can’t sleep or function when they’re acting up. Yeah they’re way worse because societal factors have frequently made them worse by forcing me to use my limbs and increase my pain anyway, but I’ve been working to cure them for years. 

I’m the middle I’ve got allergies to fragrances (including vapes) and weed. That makes lots of situations around other people potentially deadly. If we as a society didn’t think creating a cloud of fragrance or smoke around you in public spaces was acceptable since it gets into other peoples bodies in potentially harmful ways, I wouldn’t have this issue. But so many people are allergic to different things that I accept eliminating everything that releases compounds into the air is not a reasonable ask. A few hundred years ago, I’d be able to breathe just fine so it’s technically created by society, and many of the issues I face are because of the way different situations are designed. So I need more thought out into how we design airflow in different spaces, but won’t go so far as to claim that my disability there is only based on how disability is treated.
Yeah, the aspie supremacists are quite cringe. Nothing is wrong with feeling empowered by your disability, the problem comes when you try and take it to the point of claiming that autism is a superpower.

I can totally understand how this reactionary ideology came about as a reaction to the demonization of autism by groups like Autism $peaks, but it is basically fighting fire with fire.

Saying ""autism isn't a disability"", is often said by people who forget entire segments of the autistic community that are definitely disabled by having autism. It's cool you're aspie and all but that doesn't mean there aren't people with higher support needs than you. That's basically what I would say to them.

It's also worth noting that aspie supremacy is also anti-disability pride, because aspie supremacy and declaring them to be not disabled is an attempt to distance themselves from the concept of disability. And that is something I simply refuse to accept. Aspie supremacists can do whatever they want... Over there... While the rest of us maintain disability solidarity and the idea that we need unity to stand together.

Neurodiversity is interesting because in a way it is a separate movement but it is alongside disability rights just with the addition of all mental health not just disabilities. Aspie supremacists try and claim the Neurodiversity movement for themselves occasionally but I oppose this strongly because solidarity is more important than *being right all the time.* If we have disagreements or different perspectives, we discuss them cleanly and productivity, we should never ever fight another comrade who believes in solidarity.

As we move forward and we start becoming more organised... We need to remember, what makes us strong is our differences, our experiences are all different, and we have so many unique perspectives. We would be a swiss army knife of an active movement. I hope one day we will be recognised alongside LGBT pride and other large movements. Because if we don't, we won't see the world we want to create.
* condition: we all have them. Nature of life, biodiversity and neurodiversity.
* impairment: if a condition cannot be treated and it leads to limitations in function.
* disability: when a condition or impairment reaches a barrier in home, society, workplace, and it prevents access to services, opportunity, and equity. The barrier in question is often there because of poor design or thoughtlessness of the functional authorities.

These are my definitions for them.

My autism is an impairment in some regards, but I do not consider it a disability (to me).

Thank goodness that my psych diagnosis didn't enter my claim. I'm sorry to see that things haven't changed.

In general people don't understand how severe mental illness works. You can get bursts of happiness and still be depressed. Also, most people smile in photos in modern times because it's socially expected. Mental health tends to fluctuate over time. Mental illness can cause cognitive & executive function deficits.
We understand that it's not a permanent disability that the pay for, but there is a clause which they will compensate for mental health.
That's interesting. The absolute best thing I ever did for my mental health was getting off social media. No FB, IG, etc.  I decided my real friends deserved actual phone calls and text messages.  I also eventually got off every psych med too. Which made me feel human again.  But, we all have different needs.
Also, I was off work for 2 years and received payment first from my job for 6 months and then from my insurance. I was also able to travel and do any activity that would be helpful for my mental health. So no, I couldn't be outside because then I'm not really sick bs. Being happy and being on the beach is obviously no sign of mental stability. That sounds very absurd what you claim even when it is the US.

p0066,popular,mh_wp,I reported my therapist today. Is he discriminating against me for being disabled?,172,disability,"> Because of my mental health issues and/or medications, I seriously struggle with focus and memory. My wife helps me remember things and I rely on her to remember almost everything because I forget so much. If I don't write it down, it literally didn't happen.

I completely identify with that!  I've started asking my doctors if they're ok with me recording our appointments.  Not every provider is ok with it, which is why I always ask.  I've been recording my therapy sessions for years.  It's great because I don't have that anxiety around making sure I'm taking good notes or remembering every little thing that's said.  I think I've gone back and listened to... maybe 10% of the sessions?  But for those sessions, it's *very* helpful to have the recordings.

It's even better for medical appointments because I can focus on what the doctors are saying rather than worrying about trying to remember it all for later.  Again, I never do it without asking the doctor first and making sure everyone is ok with me recording them.  I explain that I have cognitive issues and auditory processing disorder - my therapist suggested I explain is an accommodation for my disability.  Most doctors are fine with it. Some are not.  I even had one doctor refuse to let me record the appointment, but then at the very end of the appointment he recorded a summary of his diagnosis and recommendations, which was better than nothing.
First, I am so very, very sorry you were treated so horribly.  Therapy is supposed to be a safe place that supports, not causing more issues.  Second, your story is almost identical to mine.  I am a veteran and thought it was just the VA, but obviously, that’s not the case.  I have ptsd from a few sources, but the main one is literally from the way I am treated by medical staff.  I once had a dr fold her arms in front of her chest while listening to me beg for help with the pain, and she and her nurse LAUGHED at me.  My new psych told me that the reason I’m not getting mental health help is because of my attitude and the way I treat people.  I have been begging for therapy since I lost my therapist in October.  I was supposedly starting with a new therapist today, only to find out it’s just an intake, to see if/what I might qualify for.  I’ve had one of these at least 5 times in the past 6 months.  I could go on and on.  I understand😢. That said, never see this person again.  You are supposed to be comfortable with your therapist, that will never happen with this person.  Report them, contact the advocate, and keep looking for real help.  You did not do anything wrong, and you did not deserve this treatment.  I’m so very, very sorry you were traumatized by the very person who is supposed to be helping.
Good to know. My son is on SSDI and we are asked to list all providers he’s seen. 
I just thought it best to move on to another provider rather than have something negative he might write in the medical record. 
Mental health services in this country are very lacking and advocating for yourself can be very difficult. I wish him well.
It was just my take. You asked people if you should have reported him? I didn’t think you should. You will most  likely receive a letter dismissing you as a patient. 
I realize you no plan to see him again but it’s in your medical record now. Wish you the best.

You get excited. You look forward to that future. You might even try to find some nice clothes or something. 

""Oh happy birthday. Yeah I decided not to throw you a party or anything like I said I would"". You're sad. You miss the future you were looking forward to. You are mourning your lost party. 

""By the way could you come serve cake at my kid's birthday party?"" Salt in the wound. A big reminder of the party you were expecting and didn't get. 

That's a completely possible scenario. It would be totally normal and natural to feel those types of feelings. Maybe you'd also be angry that the person got your hopes up then didn't do it. Or like an idiot for believing them in the first place. Or some other negative emotions about it. 



You're in the same type of situation. You expected something to happen in your future. You expected to graduate and get an office job that you would be good at. You weren't able to graduate and weren't able to get an office job. And to make things sting even more you had to watch other people celebrating. 

That sucks. That really sucks. And yeah it's absolutely normal and okay to be mourning like you lost something. You never actually had it, but you thought you would. 


 I'm really sorry you're going through that. That you have these medical and mental health issues. That they're causing problems. That you lost out on something that could have been really good for you. I hope you can find a new future that's still good. And that you'll be able to enjoy your future enough that you don't miss the one you thought you were going to have. But until then it's totally okay to feel bad about all of this. 

And even if you end up getting a really cool job that you really enjoy and you have piles of money it will still be okay if sometimes you wonder how things would have been if you were able to graduate now and get that office job. And to maybe feel a bit sad that you didn't get the chance to find out. It should be something you dwell on or that takes over your life. But it's okay to think about it sometimes.
I just want you to know you can go back to college. I have severe mental illness, have had over 50 psych hospitalizations in 8 years, dropped out of college at the beginning of the hospitalizations, lived in group homes for the mentally ill for several years until I stabilized, and went back to college after 5 years and took low credit semesters for 4 more years and just graduated in December. I'm also physically disabled and use a walker or wheelchair and a service dog. It's hard work and now I only need to be hospitalized for my mental health every 6months to a year apart and am going to grad school in the fall. I still do therapy twice a week and see my psychiatrist about once a month. But it is possible if you want it. 

And, it's completely normal to grieve for what you thought was your future. I think we all go through that at some point when we come to terms with our disabilities.

p0069,popular,mh_wp,Getting divorced due to disability,152,disability,"OMG are you me?? Seriously, I've gone through exactly the same ordeal one year ago. The only difference in my case was that my wife also moved out right away (literally the next morning after telling me she'd leave me) and moved in with another guy 3 weeks later. Turns out they had already been seeing each other for a while. But I don't think he was the main reason she left me. Her main reason was my disability, which has gotten significantly worse during the past 6-7 years. Just like in your case, my wife didn't talk to me about her struggles and when she finally dumped me, she refused to give our marriage another chance. I begged her to go to therapy with me. I made a million different suggestions. I told her she could move out but we could stay married, so she'd feel more free. It was very painful to make these suggestions but I made them anyway. But she just said no to everything.

I, too, wanted to have kids really badly. And although I'm a bit younger than you (34), I'm not sure I'll ever get that chance. I don't even know I'll ever find a new partner. I definitely won't ever find a woman like her... she was the love of my life and perfect in absolutely every way.

I, too, have indescribable regret and I, too, feel a lot of anger. Towards myself, towards her, towards others. I've been seeing a therapist for several years and after my wife left me, my therapist said: ""I saw this coming a long time ago, I should've told you to do something about it before it's too late"". Yet, she didn't. No one told me anything. And I wasn't able to feel it because I was too busy with my disability wrecking my body and soul.

I, too, was very scared of the practicalities. But looking back from 1 year in the future, I can promise you that the practicalities will be figured out. I was very stressed about them in the beginning but I'm now doing pretty well in this department. I'm living a very independent life and I'm proud of that.

What hasn't gone away is the pain and lovesickness. Still today, I think of my ex-wife every single day and I dream of her most nights. I miss her so, so, so much. When I masturbate, I think of having sex with her rather than other women. I know it's not a healthy behavior but I can't help it. It's humiliating, knowing that she's living and having sex with some other guy now but I can't help it. I'd do absolutely anything to get her back. Just like your wife has done, my wife told me some extremely painful things right after she left me. Still, I'd take her back in a heartbeat.

For roughly 9 months I've now been hanging out on various dating apps, trying to find a new partner. But it's fucking hard man. I hate how literally every single woman on every dating app wants a guy who is ""optimistic"", ""positive"", ""cheerful"", ""fun"" etc.. I'm so sick of reading crap like: ""I love my life and you should, too!"" and ""Live, love, laugh!"" - obviously written by able-bodied women who don't have any major problems in their lifes. You're basically not allowed to have any baggage. If you do, you're immediately sieved out. But how CAN'T I have baggage when I've gone through some truly traumatizing experiences thanks to my disability? Just today a girl on a dating app texted me: ""It sounds like you take life lightly and don't worry about the things you went through, is that right? Cuz I like people like that."" How does one even respond to a message like this? If I say: ""yes, that's right"", I tell her a giant lie (something I hate doing). However, if I'm honest and I say: ""Not exactly, of course my disability has taken a serious toll on me"", she'll ghost me right away.

And then, my thoughts are naturally drawn to my ex-wife again. Despite 9 months of intensive dating app usage, I haven't been on a single date and I've had longer conversations with maybe 3 women. It's so indescribably depressing. And so, naturally, I think to myself: ""God, if I still had HER, I wouldn't need to talk to all these clowns on these dating apps."" But I can't even talk to her in a regular fashion because she has completely broken off contact with me. After my wife left me, I asked her if we could at least remain friends but she said: ""No, you'll just use the friendship to ask me for help with something and I don't want to help you with anything anymore.""

So... unfortunately, I don't have much advice to give. As you can tell, my mental health is still miserable. I've been suffering immensely from this break-up. But at least I can empathize with you 1000000%. And just one recommendation: try to find something that gives you joy. I started participating in a theater ensemble. It's not quite easy with my disability but the people in the group are very nice about it. I've always wanted to perform a theater play and now I get to do that this year. They even gave me a lead role, which I'm very proud of. The new hobby hasn't made the pain go away but it has made it at least a little more bearable. I practice at home almost every day and at least during that hour that I practice, I forget about my wife and I focus completely on the material. So... if there's some kind of hobby you can do that would give you joy, maybe you should consider trying that out.

I relate to this a lot! Even within the disabled community I am not disabled enough. I have a lot of mental health conditions and am chronically ill. I have a service dog to help me and thanks to him I can work again. But I constantly feel overwhelmed and like I’m doing too much but I don’t have another option. I need money to get the healthcare I need. And to get that money I need to work. It doesn’t matter how dizzy or depressed or weak or exhausted I feel. I have no other option.

so, I got denied once, almost died and then got it approved by an ALJ the day before I was supposed to have a hearing with her. I have a bunch of physical and mental issues. But I am obsessed and terrified daily that I will lose SSDI because I am close friends with two people who did lose it. And those people seem sick enough that they should still qualify (one has incurable cancer, is an ABK double amputee and was on SSDI, and the other has severe mental health issues and has been hospitalized hundreds of times throughout her life, but was kicked off SSI just because she applied for college. She's still trying to get it back)
yup that would be the beautifully prepared case i mentioned (well documented)... i've been hospitalised a few times and sent to the er even more, but my admittance is not consistent even though i've landed in the er for that or other reasons at least once a year. my documentation is all over since i'm not applying for mental health reasons alone and have seen more doctors than i can count. i also don't have the ability to compile everything myself, even though i do participate as much as i can, so my case, which i foolishly started before getting a lawyer and only got one once the appeal phase started, is over 2 years in. been waiting on a court appeal date for more than half of that because my lawyer requested *closed captions* when i expressed issues with using my voice on video calls.

Here is exactly what he said: ""We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally
disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement."" We already have laws that allow for the involuntary confinement of people who pose an imminent danger to themselves or others. This has nothing to do with ""mental health disabilities"" since the vast majority of the mentally ill never commit a violent act.

[Here's his speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVO5GVqtosY), this sentence is at 6:40.
As a nurse that spent 3 years as a prison nurse, I will say that many mentally ill people should be locked up for their own safety and for the safety of others and they are at great expense in our jails. Mentally ill people are in need of help. One of the saddest stories I ever heard was a new inmate telling me that the reason he held up a McD's was he was hungry and couldn't figure out any other way to get food. When he had eaten his fill he told them that they could call the cops. Others that could not on their own take their medication correctly. Saw one guy trying to renew his meds two weeks early at the drugstore because he had already taken them all. 

Many mentally ill people ARE locked up 'involuntarily' and it is the jails that they are in where they get basically no mental health care and when they have served their time, they are released back onto the streets to yet again ""lather, rinse and repeat"". One of our nurses left for a community health position and where she met up again with one of our ex-inmates, and he had been going for his care. He had stayed in jail without parole - his choice - served his whole sentence. One day they found him with a blood sugar reading of a 1000 and for those that don't know, the normal range is around 70-110 or thereabouts. These people can not take care of themselves. The guy that held up the McDs for food, I'm sure that the corporation would have rather given him food that he needed, rather than the possibilities of the tragic outcomes that could have happened. Our mental health system in the USA is a disaster and we should be ashamed that these sick people are left to try and function on their own.  

I see a guy wandering around our town also an ex-inmate that sexually molested his niece and nephew when they were way little. Now he hangs out at the local grocery store or wandering around town. Apparently doesn't have to register as a sexual predator. He has his problems but every time I see him hanging around little children makes me cringe, however, nothing I can do about it. 

Mental health is not the sole purview of any President and reading Trump's post in total shows that he acknowledges that there is a problem and something needs to be done but no one has had the guts to do it yet.

Saying that all Republicans should be locked up is even more inflammatory than anything else here. We all have the right to follow our convictions about politics in our own way and I get so tired of Democrats thinking that they are the only ones  allowed to have opinions or be allowed to function according to their own convictions is doing more to destabilize our country than anything our current, former, and/or next president can do. If you look to the right, one of reddit rules is decency and civility and statements like that from Jeffe333 is certain against the rules.
Not technically during the holocaust since that process is used for describing the systematic killing of Jews.

Exact moment he transitions to this ideal: 3:25 - Racism and White Supremacy are addressed. 5:20 - Identify early warning signs. 6:03 - stop violent video games. 6:40 - mental health  laws/treatment/involuntary confinement when necessary. 7:05 - Remove access to firearms for those who pose extreme risk / remove firearms through rapid due process. 7:30 death penalty - quickly - for mass murders.   


For what it is worth, over the last year (Aug 2018-Aug 2019), there were 20 notable mass shootings (defined as those which have made national news, resulted in multiple casualties in the same location, and firearm related). There is no universal criteria for what is considered a mass shooting. Of those 20, 8 were committed by individuals reported as being mentally ill or having some sort of mental disturbance. 4 were committed with racism/political goals/white supremacy motives/ideologies. Crime, Domestic violence, workplace violence, and drug raid make up the remaining 8. With a staggering number having mental health crisis / disturbances as a contributing factor, a change of some sort needs to happen with mental health. I am not saying Trump is right. He's actually far from it. What we need is access to mental health treatment instead of 3-6 month waits for new patients and sometimes 1-3 month waits for current patients with psychiatrists or even several month wait for counselors. Many who reach out for help do so at the lowest point and are turned away because provider shortages/unable to meet demand of the public.

p0078,popular,mh_wp,someone on this sub equated my severe mental disability with “being forgetful and bad at conversation”,128,disability,"My husband and I are both on SSDI, me for mental health issues and him for a severe TBI he obtained from a high elevation fall. We applied and got benefits 10 years apart, both approved at the first stage (so that should tell you how severe our disabilities are; that is, how serious the documentation was).

This was not our plan. We couldn’t believe it when I started failing at my job (he was already on SSDI) and it began looking like I would have to go on disability also, because I was on the fast track to being fired. We never intended for neither of us to be working. We had a small child to raise, suddenly on fixed incomes, at 50% what our family’s previous salary had been.

Long story short, that is not what anyone sees or cares about. We have had pure hatred and vitriol thrown in our faces because we “sit around all day and do nothing.” All people see is a pair of people who look very much like we could be working, home all day every day. What people don’t realize is that we each wish we could be working desperately. We lost our house, both car, most of our belongings, etc, when I was declared disabled. Even worse, I fell into a deep depression upon the loss of my career, one that led to my husband actually leaving me. 

Then I was a single mom on disability with just our son, until the day I had a psychotic break alone with him and as a result, I lost custody of him for 3 years. I missed all of his middle school. So yeah - people may have their challenges with work, but we face our own challenges - and sometimes they’re life-shattering. I eventually got custody back of my son when I remarried his father, a whole other story in itself, but partially which occurred because I was afraid no one else would ever marry me or love me again.

We DON’T just sit around all day. I volunteer as a crisis counselor for two helplines, while my husband, who has more limitations than I do, takes majority care of our home (a small apartment that we are blessed to be able to rent) and our son (who is now 18). I have gotten used to people ghosting us as friends when they find out we’re disabled. Locally, we have my MIL and my parents are out of state but very financially and emotionally supportive. It’s fine - we don’t need anybody else, especially if they’re going to be jealous of how we live without knowing the first thing about it. I have learned to stay in my own lane and count my blessings that we have landed on our feet.
I’m sorry for what you’ve been through - it’s a lot, even for one lifetime. I wish more people could read this and understand. Especially when it comes to mental health, I wonder if people think ‘I get depressed sometimes too, where’s my money’ without having any idea of the havoc severe mental illness (especially psychosis/mania) can wreak on your life.

I have been in your position, 2009 I attempted suicide due to the chronic pain I had endured for 13 years. I couldn’t take it anymore. 

However I was able to get to a place of radical acceptance. It takes time and you need to be in a place whereby you are mentally strong. 

Defo consider changing or starting anti-depression meds. Once mine were changed, I felt so much better and gradually the depression began to lift. 

I accept now that my body doesn’t work like other people, and it never will and I’m ok with that. 

It has taken 20 years to reach radical acceptance but I no longer think about or pine for my life before this disability. 

I moderate what I do and listen to my body. I’ll never go ice skating or skiing again but I still participate in hobbies I love, like collecting gemstones and playing the flute. 

It is possible darling, you have to switch your mindset. 

Please do not ever consider suicide. Please. Life is precious even with a disability. You don’t stay in a point of crisis. Being suicidal is being in crisis, and nobody stays in that crisis phase forever. 

Consider getting mental health support, I promise you it’s worth it.

Thank you for this harsh truth. I’ve felt such a pressure (even from other disabled folks!) who’s all so positive EMBRACE IT! LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE! LOVE YOURSELF! etc. It makes me mad and it’s so forced. I can’t lie to myself. 

And it’s normal. I mean, I don’t want to hate myself, I don’t wanna d1e from ED, I don’t wanna suffer that much. But i DONT have to be positive and fully accepting of myself. And it’s normal. Maybe I will learn it, maybe it’s a life-long process… who knows. 

I’m trying to be realistic, especially when it comes to my mental health treatment and protocol. I always say to my doctors - please be realistic, don’t lie to me, I know that some things will probably stay forever. Like, you can’t just do lobotomy and forget about trauma or get rid of effect it has on your brain, because it’s permanent.

I Was In Your Ex Situation Unfortunately. I definitely Understand that Especially Financially and Emotionally 

As Taking care of a Disabled Person is Very Mentally Draining 

And Society is Individualistic and Ableist so it makes it no better 

I Tried to help my situation. I reached out to every organization for help

I have Invisible Disabilities as well so people can't see it so therefore I look abled bodied 

I worked jobs Lifting 300lbs 400lbs barrels of water and fruit and vegetables 

Crowded job had panic attacks blurred vision lightheadedness and dizziness 

Everyday at the jobs

Till the fact my body couldn't handle feeling like that everyday 

Plus it was messing with my mental health 

I felt like a burden on family for a issue I didn't ask to have.

Like I understand people Houses and if I can't keep a job 

Which I couldn't I tried but always quitted 

So I got kicked out a lot by family and friends of the family 

Which I understand and stuff 

Really Don't Agree With The ""Learned Helplessness"" thing 

I understand it has some valid points 

But I just personally feel like it's a Individualistic approach or judgement 

To someone that is trying to get their situation atleast for my situation 

I was trying to work jobs getting headaches and Panic attacks just being on the phone 

And I worked a lot of public open jobs 

Which I wished people seem my disabilities so they wouldn't call me lazy or such

Or say things like ""Learned Helplessness"" and stuff 

Because I actually was trying to help myself 

Just I can't control the Disability process 

I can't put a gun to nobody head and say approve me for disability in less than a year 

Or tell a job to get me accomodations that actually benefits me and not the business 

It's so easy to go to Jail than actually trying survive in society

But I understand my Family and friends kicking me out 

Wasn't anything personal it's capitalism 

If I can't bring in a profit or benefit individually to a household or someone life.

I'm a burden and I understand that. Can't Force nobody to help you 

And I understand people mental health just taking someone else in 

Or caring for a disabled person 

Even though I didn't ask to have a disability 

But if it's making you comfortable evict them don't feel guilty 

I understand taking care of people with a disability or just anyone is difficult as well 

Atleast for me I didn't get evicted like that 

Atleast in the black community we don't do all that legal stuff 

They just put a Gun out on you or make physical threats to you 

From my experience 

I left the same day 

Remember my uncle making a threat 

That ""My Shit Better be in the Garage By Saturday"" it was a Thursday that week in 2018

Had to Leave unfortunately 

Which I did plus living with people that doesn't want you there 

Is very mentally draining 

I was scared to leave my room

Because I got threats violent threats 

Because I couldn't keep a job 

Just Disability takes years for people 

Especially non invisible disabilities 

So it took years 

I was seeing my Mental health workers 

Which I was in Georgia so I didn't have insurance 

So they kept supplying me with the same medicine that didn't work 

And I couldn't afford to get the new medicine my doctor prescribed 

I understand you have to do what's best for you 

I know I was trying 

Like I felt like I was a burden and unaliving myself at. That time 

Because I didn't want to be a burden 

I hate being a burden on people 

That's why I'm scared to get in relationships with women 

Because my disability is something I'm trying to figure out 

But I didn't ask for this

Feel like Eugenicists want me dead 

Not trying to trigger anyone 

Just your ex situation sounds like my situation 

But you have to do what's best for your mental health 

I didn't take it personal.

Even though it was family members 

That I couldn't reach out to 

Disabilities in my life is just hard 

Just people don't realize saying Learned Helplessness 

They don't realize it's not too much help as you think 

And plus it's a very huge waiting list 

Sometimes years long

Just getting help is not immediate

Just not enough resources 

Especially for a person like me that couldn't keep a stable job 

Which I felt bad I couldn't 

But people wasn't in my body they couldn't see how I was feeling 

Not trying to trigger anyone
At the end of the day, it isn't your responsibility.  They need to make an effort to either get a job or file for SS disability, section 8, food stamps, Medicaid, and find housing.  You didn't indicate what the disability is.  Are you actually caregiving, like feeding, bathing, etc, or just financial?  You're not family.  Even if you were, it's not worth sacrificing your mental health for this.  It sounds like you have your own family in the home as well.  So they're dealing with this as well?

It's very easy for someone with ""learned helplessness"" to give up and just rely on someone else.  My VA therapist introduced me to that term.  It sounds like your ex is experiencing this.

p0085,popular,mh_wp,"Is anyone else with a learning disability sick of hearing about ""growth mindset""?",112,disability,"I experienced this a lot in highschool. I was in an online program that my school provided due to issues with anxiety ADHD that made it nearly impossible to learn in a traditional classroom setting. Basically, instead of attending normal classes, we went to a small building on the school property and worked independently online, having teachers there to help if we needed it. The administrator of this program who also worked as one of the teachers was such a bitch to me about me having ADHD, and when I became severely anorexic which caused even more learning issues due to malnourishment, it got even worse. She had this mindset that anyone who didn't work to her standards just ""wasn't trying,"" no matter what their situation was, and treated people with mental health and/or learning issues like we were being actively malicious and defiant. She always tried to frame how she treated us as ""giving us motivation"" and ""making sure that we worked to the best of our ability,"" but instead of doing any of that, she just treated us like we were supposed to be robots, working nonstop not only in class, but at home as well, with no life apart from schoolwork. 

For example, one day, I was having more difficulty than usual with focusing and was fidgeting a lot. She came up to me and started bitching at me about not working as much as I ""should,"" despite the fact that I was ahead of my classmates in terms of overall progress for the year because I pushed myself to complete as many lessons as I could every day. I apologized and told her that I have ADHD and that I was still in the process of figuring out what meds help me manage my symptoms. She told me, ""No, you're just being insubordinate and don't want to work. If you can't control your ADHD, that's your problem. I should just expell you right now."" She fucking threatened to expell me, which she didn't even have the power to do, because I have ADHD. 

Her behavior continued, despite all the teachers defending me and trying to explain that I not only had a learning disability but was dealing with an eating disorder that caused severe malnourishment. I had learned to ignore her for the most part until my senior year. The shit she said to me made me immediately walk out of class and drop out. A couple weeks before school started, I was in a severe wreck that nearly took my life. The two biggest injuries that impacted my schoolwork was my back being broken in 6 places (can't sit up for very long without severe pain) and a brain hemorrhage (caused cognitive and functional issues). Because of the wreck, I was in the hospital when school started and couldn't go back to school for a few months, which meant I was quite a bit behind on my classwork. When I did finally get back to school, I worked my ass off to get caught up, though it was pretty much impossible when I started so far behind and was still dealing with my injuries, which caused me to need to go home early a lot of days. One day, she came up to me as soon as I got there and immediately started her bullshit. I told her that she couldn't reasonably expect me to have made the same amount of progress as my classmates given my situation. She told me that if I didn't finish my remaining work, at least half a year's worth, in the next 2 months, she wouldn't even allow me to come back next year and finish my classes, and that she would make sure I would never have a chance to graduate from highschool at all. I just gathered my stuff and left because there's no reason I should destroy my mental and physical health to do something that was basically impossible for someone in my position to do, only for me to not be able to graduate anyway. I sent the HS principal an email stating that I was officially dropping out and told him exactly what the program administrator said. Apparently, she got in trouble for it because when I came back to turn in my school laptop, she tried to say she ""didn't mean I actually wasn't allowed to graduate"" and ""was just trying to 'motivate' me.""

p0086,popular,mh_wp,people with mental disabilities do you feel like you’re treated weirdly by physically disabled people?,109,disability,"That really sucks, I'm really sorry that's been your experience :( For me, it's been the exact reverse. I am physically disabled (with mental health issues as well but the physical disabilities are much more disabling for me) and I had to leave my school's disability advocacy group because it was full of people with mental disabilities who were ableist towards me with my physical disability -- to list just one example, telling me not to ""complain"" about the distance between my dorm and the dining hall because their dorm was further, when they can walk perfectly fine and I'm the one who skips meals because I physically cannot make it to the dining hall and whose mobility is so bad that I've recently been prescribed a custom wheelchair. I am telling you this not to be like ""um you're wrong actually people with physical disabilities get discriminated against people with mental disabilities 🤓"", not at all. Just to say that unfortunately, any kind of disabled person can be ableist. We always tell abled people that disabled people are not a monolith, and it's true. It really sucks that sometimes disabled people beat down on other disabled people who aren't like them. We really need to stick together and advocate for each other because it only helps everyone in the long run!
(I am both physically disabled and neurodivergent.) I found the opposite to be true actually. There are a lot of folks with mental illness who refuse to identify as disabled. They like to seperate mental illness from disability because they still have internalized ableism. There often conversations and advocacy around ""mental health"" but they *never* identify or view themselves as disabled. 


However, on both sides, there is a long history of disabilities being segregated from each other - charities work that focuses on one disability only. This is in line with the charity and medical model of disability, which wants society to view disabilities as individual medical conditions that need to be cured. Disability people have been taught from the beginning to separate ourselves by ""medical condition"" or individual disability. 


We all need to work on cross-disability solidarity for sure. Some folks with mental health issues need to shed there internalized ableism and not shy away from the disability label. And some visibly physically disabled people need to expand their own definition of disability to include and support folks with invisible disabilities.


It's tough. We've all be taught a bunch of ableism garbage that we need to unlearn. But everyone is at a different stage of unlearning.
Sort of?

In my experience the overwhelming majority of people with physical disabilities are extremely chill and supportive. I mean, mental illness is five times more common in people with physical disabilities, so that dude with the cane probably understands psychiatric conditions pretty intimately, man. In my experience if you tell someone who's stuck at home due to shitty mobility options or whatever that you are also stuck at home due to agoraphobia, their reaction is, nine times out of ten, ""it sucks, right?"" and not ""ACTUALLY I'm stuck at home for real while you're just stuck at home for pretend"" or whatever. Like it happens but it's extremely rare.

With that said, I'm schizophrenic and have run into a lot of disabled people, both physically and cognitively disabled, who only understand that in terms of stereotypes, like the idea that missing a dose makes a schizophrenic dangerous, or that our behaviour in states of psychosis is our ""true selves"" coming out. **I blame the poor public education around mental health** and what psychiatric conditions can really do to people in extreme cases for that, not disabled people as a demographic that should be held to some kind of exceptional standard just because they're disabled, if that makes sense.

Although, if you want to see bad opinions galore, mention body integrity identity disorder. [This is the ONLY chill take I've ever seen on it personally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pyw6ORugUU) ([follow-up video](https://youtu.be/GAouhje5Vm8?si=fr07CLqqIU9ALa4P)) but it's not hard to find old posts of people dunking on ""trans-abled"" people and by extension ""crazy people"" without any empathy or understanding of the psychiatric condition.
I have mental (bipolar II, anxiety) and physical (degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia) and have never been treated differently by people with physical disabilities. 

The people who have treated me the worst were perfectly able bodied, and seemingly mentally stable who were freaked out by mental health disorders and made my life a hell.
As someone who's posts could be taken this way sometimes I think some clarification is needed. While I can only speak for myself and the opinions I have offered, it's not a case of diminishing or bashing mental health as an inferior or lesser form of disability. 

My bugbear is people who are self diagnosing based off of stuff like ""I watched some tiktoks and they convinced me I have ADHD/bipolar/ocd but no Dr will sign me off so I cant get benefits.""
I make myself feel weird bc society (social services, mental health professionals, peers) think my disabilities can be cured or are just a rough patch in life.
For me it’s hard to not envy other physically disabled people because of how much my physical symptoms are shrugged off as being in my head. A friend of mine was in the same boat; physically and mentally disabled but having her physical symptoms shrugged off and her concerns ignored while being accused of being a hypochondriac. Then one day about a year ago she had a grand mal seizure. Finally they couldn’t ignore her anymore and she’s got specialists for her physical AND mental health assigned to her now. 

I’ve been being gaslit for years over physical symptoms that are just getting worse and worse. Even though I’ve actually had a psychiatrist *and* a psychologist confirm that they’re not ‘in my head’, I continue to be gaslit and shrugged off. Now, am I to the point that I wish I’d just collapse with some major symptom so they **have** to stop gaslighting me? You bet your ass. Do I actually *want* my symptoms to get that bad? Obviously not. I’m just so desperate and tired of being brushed aside because someone slapped a diagnosis on me that the medical community thinks means I’m a ‘troublemaker’.

But this is all to do with how doctors treat me while having both. I’ve never had another disabled person invalidate me.
It's also been the same for me. I have both, but primarily physical disabilities (chronic illnesses) that precede my mental health issues. 

I think that the most frustrating aspect for mw js when people try to frame mental illnesses like ""What if you had a disability nobody could see!? People never say this ableist stuff to people with physical disabilities!!"" And I'm sitting here with my invisible illnesses like 😬
I think it’s also worth mentioning that, contrary to (seemingly) popular belief, a majority of physically disabled people aren’t neurotypical. Many of us have developmental disorders (e.g. autism or ADHD), and it’s also very common to develop mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. as a result of our experiences as physically disabled people (many of us experience abuse from family or our partners, get bullied by our peers, or have medical trauma). Hell, sometimes we even start out with mental health conditions that end up causing or contributing to our physical health problems! (Psychological trauma is thought to play a part in some health conditions, such as fibromyalgia, autoimmune diseases, etc.)

Able-bodied mentally disabled people have a lot more in common with physically disabled people than they may think, but a lot of them still accuse us of being neurotypical when we push back against their ableism toward us. It’s very frustrating. Showing solidarity would be a lot more helpful to the both of us in the long run, but othering and attacking us isn’t productive at all.
Honestly? I'd bet on internalized able-ism. I was guilty of it for a lot of years as a kid. My sibling was higher support needs than I, and I was got so angry he couldn't just lie or mask like I did. Like ""don't you want to be *normal?*"" ""Just lie it's not that hard!"" ""Come on and just stop doing that!"" Which I've apologized profusely for and adapted for. 

So there's a lot of ""we can choose to mask, we should 'try to be normal', why do you get special language and recognitions and supports?!"" kind of lashing out without understanding the parallels that exist there. For  instance: my sibling is just starting to pick up on spoon theory for Autism and anxiety. And mobility aids aren't very different from stimming aids, and both are discriminated against. 

I'd also argue there's a huge lack of recognition about how physical disabilities were fought for and still are constantly because they see the effects of the ADA every single day. But a lot of people don't understand that Autism wasn't recognized 25-30 years ago and the supports they have now were not the norm - that is to say that we are all *still* fighting.  And there's half a dozen posts every week that talk about invisible disabilities being ignored because the media portrays them as being easy to take care of.

There's likely also the ""well I was born with this, *you* developed it!"" resentment which is so utterly ironic because on the physical side you have older people telling you that ""you haven't earned your pain, you're too young/didn't work a hard enough job/have kids/whatever justification"" on top of genetic conditions. 

And most importantly: intersectionality! LGBTQ+, racial minorities, mental health, physical health, and abuse victims often check multiple boxes. We all are parallels of each other and all have similar struggles. And we have to band together because this is just another way to keep us divided and unable to fight for our rights.",really suck im really sorry thats experience exact reverse physically disabled

Of course no one cares here in America as long as ur paying Big Pharma. Having your blood sugar too high feels like shit having it to low feels like shit.

p0088,popular,mh_wp,AITA for telling her to stay in her lane?,105,disability,"Im disabled with mental health issues. I am ABSOLUTELY ALLOWED TO JOKE ABOUT MY DISABILITY AS ARE YOU. The audacity of some “professionals” is hilarious- she should accept being upset, we have to a million times in our lives. Especially since she WAS way out of line. The moment i left group If have contacted someone to file a complaint. Joking about a disability is NOT equal to putting yourself down and that person sounds ill fitted for their job tbh
I don’t like to frame things in an AITA way. I think it is a hindrance for resolving the actual issues at hand, and pushes people into their corners rather than restoring or developing a sense of understanding.

There seem to be a few issues here: 

1- Is it ok for people with disabilities to use humor that we direct at ourselves or in a mutually agreed upon way among each other?

Again, I want to get away from judgements about “ok” or “not ok.” It is a thing some people with disabilities do, and some people don’t. Some people will feel offense— all, some, or none of the time. Some people will feel relief, connection, etc—all, some, or none of the time. This is just the way it is. Then question then becomes, what is a helpful way to facilitate a conversation among people with different feelings, perspectives, and abilities?

2- Is it ok for a person who does not have a disability to feel offended by jokes made by people with disabilities about their disabilities?

Just as with anybody else, feelings are feelings. See above.

3- Is it ok for a person to tell you how *you should* feel about a joke you make about yourself?

A person telling you how you “should” feel about something doesn’t change the way you “do” feel about it. It usually has the opposite impact and makes you defensive of your feelings or perspective, causing you to cling onto them even harder.

4- Is it helpful to talk about one’s unease with jokes somebody makes about themself?

It depends on how one goes about it and how the other person receives it. Sometimes it can be helpful, and sometimes it will become unproductive. If both people (or the group) have an intention of listening and hearing each other out without judgement and allowing room for everyone to “be,” than it can be a workshop for developing understanding, even if people still disagree at the end of the converation.

This kind of communication can be a challenge, even for people in the best state of mind. For people who are experiencing mental health problems, it can be really challenging to feel triggered and not become reactively defensive. Some people may be able to practice skills that make it a bit easier to manage their triggers in a more productive way, and some have less capacity for it. For those who have some capacity to do so, these skills can help diminish triggers from turning into unmanageable emotional cascades.

5- Is it helpful for a therapist (or anyone) to tell a client (or anyone) to shut up.

No. Maybe only in the very rarest circumstances where silence is needed for safety and the two people have a very trusting relationship already.

6- Is it helpful to tell someone you disagree with that they are “out of their lane?”

Usually not. Not if you are interested in having a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas. If you just want to push someone away in defense, it can go either way. The other person may either back off, or they may respond by escalating the situation further. It’s a gamble.

&nbsp;

7- Who was wrong...were you out of line...were they out of line, etc?

That’s really impossible to judge based on only hearing one side of the story. I’m cautious to jump on the “they are the a-hole” bandwagon, because I don’t think it will really be helpful to you in moving forward with what’s next. 

What you may want to consider, is being self reflective in a way that is kind toward yourself but also recognizes if there are ways you may have contributed to the breakdown of communication. If you feel able without getting easily triggered back into a defensive posture, apologizing for your part can sometimes loosen others up to apologize for theirs. It still may not, but practicing that skill can still be helpful for you regardless of what the other person does, **if** it doesn’t send you into a defensive spiral if they don’t respond the way you hope (which they are unlikely to do 100%, but 10% is really good.) You have to judge where you are with your own mental health and capacity. If you don’t feel able to approach the person, it can help to write it down, even if you don’t end up giving it to them, as long as you are kind to yourself in the process. 

Sometimes these kinds of challenges can be an opportunity to develop other skills that are helpful besides humor (when it goes well.) The more tools one has, the less conflicts one tends to get into that create problems in relationships. Conflicts can be more easily resolved and nobody has to be the a-hole. We can all just be human.
Honestly, it sounds like your therapists are having a power trip (both of them). 

This reminds me of feminists that put down other women for their choices; this is why I detest third-wave feminism. 

They claim to be about ""self-empowerment"" and ""choices"", but then if a woman wants to stay home, wear dresses, and bake pies and cookies, she's ""disempowering the rest of woman-kind!"" (because she won't wear pants and work outside the home). 

It's actually not dissimilar to what cults do. 

Step 1), pick an issue that correlates to a certain demographic that doesn't have a universal answer (in this case, is it acceptable to laugh at your disabilities? a = yes, b = no) 

Step 2), claim that, if such and such *does* a, they'll be disenfranchising the people that chose b (while conveniently ignoring the disenfranchisement of those that chose a)

Step 3), collect your paycheck at the end of the day for disenfranchising half of the very group you're claiming to help (because you know better than the people that are actually part of that demographic)

It's mob mentality. They're talking about ""Carrot"" like she's not even there; like her thoughts and feelings on her own condition are ""less relevant"" than what the therapist thinks about it. 

But than again, that's most the mental health field; people acting like their subjective evaluations of the human condition are scientific laws, rather than just another opinion.

p0091,popular,mh_wp,Medical Assisted Dying: Does it freak anyone else right out?,99,disability,"On one hand, I’d accept it in a heartbeat. After three suicide attempts, that sounds like a dream come true. I have treatment resistant depression and over 10 years of treatment hasn’t done much. On the other hand, I am poor af and can’t really afford all the snazzy new treatments that they’re offering now so maybe that’s why. Which brings up the point… desperate people (like me) will die when they don’t actually need to. Regardless of my severe mental health issues, many people will say that it’s a bad thing when people who could have lived healthy lives are instead killed because they are part of a specific bracket like poor. Canada might not go down that path, I don’t know. But if they start offering this in USA, very specific demographics will 100% be targeted.
I am all for The Right to Die. Doctor assisted suicide. But there is a slippery slope. Is there a link that I can read up on it? The mental health aspect of it?

My issue with doctors is: Say I've been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the doctors push and push me to undergo surgeries, chemo, radiation, whatever to extend my life...The doctors NEVER ask a person, ""do you want to live?""
I don't think it should be allowed for mental health. Unless it's treatment resistant depression, I see no reason. It just stigmatizes getting mental health treatment and working on it, people just will choose this path.

I have pathological depression that's not treatable with anto depressants, pretty much the term isn't used, but it's because my depression was caused by a TBI. 

It's different than depression that's caused by a chemical imbalance that can be treatable.

I also think this sets a slippery slope because at what point does it go and become physician assisted homicide when a person pushes the individual to do it.
For me I feel the current treatment of mental health is impaired to pharmaceutical companies pushing meds.
For me I met the criteria for MAID under mental health that was non-treatable! However, a few years ago I started receiving testosterone treatment for fertility and low and behold my chronic depression/bipolar cleared up and I'm successfully ""cured"" of my previous condition.
What I'm trying to get at is when I told my psychiatrist and DR. About the changes they said it doesn't work that way here try these meds! I have been off my meds for over a year now and I am doing better now than anytime in the last 10 years of treatment for my ""treatment resistance"" depression 
Well low and behold there are proven studies about the effects of improper hormone levels on mental health and I feel that there will be people like me who will qualify for MAID when all they need is a simple shot and follow up therapy to come to terms with the suffering they had under mental health. 
What we need is a mental health overhaul and update!
No.  You're not those people, claims about ""other options"" are wild speculation from people not actually involved with the treatment of the patients.  Wherever it's been made legal it's a long complicated process with tons of checks in place, not just someone ticking off a box.  The idea a ""cranky burned out doctor"" is going to go through the massive complicated effort involved in approval just isn't a real concern.  Following the idea of denying something because of the remote off chance it might be used inappropriately can be used to justify not allowing anything.

And you or some journalist or anyone not directly involved with a patients treatment extensively, with access to all their private information, records, and everything else, and with the appropriate training and knowledge, have zero right to decide if a person with mental health problems should or shouldn't seek assisted death.  It is as absurd as people who tell someone suffering from mental health issues to ""just exercise and you'll cheer up"".  You're not that person, you're in no position to make a judgement about anything.  No one but that patient and the professionals involved have any right to make that decision for them.

You don't get to decide for another person if their life is or is not worth living.  You don't get to decide for another person if they should or should not pursue other ""options"".
I have significant mental health issues as well as a rare, life limiting, often terminal genetic disease and I think people deserve the right to decide when the pain of living, be it physical or mental pain, outweighs any quality of life. Of course this needs to be done with qualified physician guidance and oversight, as well as documented attempts at treatments that have failed, but in the end it’s far better to allow someone to die with dignity than to force them to resort to far more painful options that can end up increasing suffering if they fail or to suffer far longer than necessary. If we respect someone’s autonomy over their body, that really needs to include their right to decide (under the mentioned circumstances) whether or not to continue their life. 

I do not live in a state with any form of death with dignity or assisted suicide, and the thought of how painful my life may become both physically and mentally (I have tried almost every medication available for bipolar disorder, severe anxiety, ptsd, etc and have been told we may be near the point where there are no other options to try) terrifies me. I have had to live within this broken body, I fight daily for quality of life, it should be my right to decide when it’s enough and I no longer want to live in constant pain. 

Sorry, this topic hits too close to home for me so I kind of vented.
The article I added above discusses this. By and large MAID patients have been privileged people seeking the same control of death that they had in life but those suffering from severe mental health problems are often impoverished and have histories and existing realities that include complex trauma. Like…we’re passing seemingly careless MAID legislation before fixing social housing problems and having a decent mental healthcare system. Like…maybe trusting patients and giving them an opportunity for autonomy will prevent people from doing it themselves which will give them access to mental health care. But I’m scared this will be abused.
I feel you on this and if I ever don't have any family members in my life anymore (as in they get old and die).  I too have a brain injury and have chronic pain.  MAiD is my backup option but I think I probably qualify for having a mental health issue too. 

If I had money for treatment that would be great.  Right now my disability probably doesn't pay for me to live in a comfortable quiet housing to not cause my symptoms to go up.  It really sucks.
This is my fear as well. Most people with severe mental health problems are being failed by the system and now the system is trying to give them an out.
I’ve been wondering about bias. The one above seems pretty balanced, though. I know ‘we’re not ready’ is often a tactic for people trying to stop things altogether but the optics of rushing this out when mental healthcare isn’t great is pretty bad.
Sound word for word what I have and promised my parents. Unfortunately I also have other disabilities as well. Currently in the process of applying for it. My.docters are not on board. Over a year later and they are still having me talk with ""advocates"" who try to find resources and help. All the advocates have been able to do is give me information for things that do not apply for me.... 
It is not easy to even have doctors think about it. They say you are not required to try every possible treatment, that what they want you to do and will not start it untill you do (my experience).  Almost 30 years with mental health trauma related. Over 15 physical, born with neurological. Every year a new issue arises, not I have one covid to add, and haven't had a day without painful migraines for months (almost constant migrane going on since 2018).
The mental health angle makes it so complex. It sounds like there’s a good way to approach this. I’m just worried Canada is rushing it for reasons I’m not clear on.
The issue here is that the current proposition does not have a long complicated process. MAID for mental health reasons is currently only legal in the Netherlands where mental healthcare and healthcare in general gets far more support/funding than in Canada and has far more of a process than is being proposed.
Dying isn't the only way to end the suffering. It is the most permanent one, though, and in the depths of depression or other mental health crises, it may seem like the best option. 

Suicide survivor. I'm ever grateful I was given treatment and not help in killing myself. I would have gladly chosen death at the bottom of my mental abyss, but instead I was given help and support I had never had before. I wasn't making logical decisions when I was in crisis. Just grasping at emotional straws.
I think the reason it’s different is that mental health conditions often make people feel like it’s hopeless. Also there’s still stigma around mental health and it’s poorly supported.
I’m conflicted on this. The class/income disparity issue is a massive issue. Kind of how rich are “eccentric” but the poor are “crazy.”

On the other hand, I’m a doctor and even when well resourced and w good support systems, some people’s mental health issues are crushing. I really don’t know how I would feel about signing off on something like this.
It will be interesting come March, how doctors make their decision and all. Does Canada have a lot mental hospitals? Or are there waiting lists for that too?

I had a stay in one here in the US and I'll BE DAMNED if I ever put myself through that again, it was like prison. I would be scared this new MAID for mental health would be a trick and I'd be locked up again.
And throw other mentally ill people who want to live but struggle financially under the bus? The system is so broken. No.

**Build a functioning mental healthcare system, expand access to mental healthcare and THEN we can have this expanding MAID to mental illness discussion. With heavy safeguards in place - right now there are none.**
I’m a physician and trying to learn more about this kind of thing. The mental health issue piece is not palatable for me at all and as you say - groups will be marginalized. Checking out that website.

In broader terms…is there an “ideal” MAID model?  I had an end stage Huntington’s patient writhing on a bed as he attempted to hang himself with his sheet and bite off his tongue…there was nothing I wanted to do more than help him with what he was trying to do in a less painful way.

I’m conflicted. As some have said, the medical community can be very patronizing and short-sighted in their definition of “quality of life.” But for some patients…it does really seem like this might work out?
US mental health facilities are atrocious.  “Therapeutic environment” my ass.
Not saying it shouldn’t be an option. But it feels like the way it is implemented says more about the intent. I’d much rather someone who wants to die do it in a safe and supportive environment rather than improvising at home where it’s going to cause more trauma to other people. I’d also much rather the request start a general mental health conversation rather than someone going it alone in a bad headspace.

I didn't really identify myself as being disabled until my late teens/early 20s but even at that point it was so clear to me that this shift in how I navigate the world has profound impacts on the way I think and approach problems in ways that can't be separated out from ""me as a person"". To attempt to distance myself (or for other people to distance me) from my disability is to pick and choose the parts of me worth ""humanizing"", or at least that's how it feels to me.

I also personally kind of get the ick from person-first because although well-meaning, 1) if anyone needs reminding that disabled people are people, they're the problem, and 2) it feels like wanting to separate the two out comes from the assumption that disability is intrinsically negative/shameful, like people want to detach you from a stigmatized term instead of destigmatizing the term. Maybe this is just me projecting because my extended family very much treated my embracing of my disability as like, me somehow insulting myself or putting myself down or underestimating my own potential/self-sabotaging?? ""You can do anything you want to if you put your mind to it!"", except no, learning that I have limits, and why I have those limits, and hiw to work around/withing those limits has been more freeing than trying to dissociate myself from disability ever has been. ""Disabled"" is a neutral modifier to me and in my experience most of the able-bodied people uncomfortable with me using it or pushing person-first are struggling with some ableist mentality even if it's not intentional/realized.

Linguistically I also just dislike person-first because it feels weird. I'm not a ""person with queerness"", etc. All that said, I can also understand why certain people/groups tend to prefer person-first and I'll always use what people prefer. In my own academic work on disability where I'm often describing all disability writ large, I usually alternate/use both, recognizing that there's people on both sides of the fence. My own personal feelings/preferences don't make other people's feelings or preferences wrong. It's a very personal choice.
I believe that it is more widely and kindly accepted to use person first. I should say that my opinion on that may come from the fact that I worked as a behavioral specialist for 23 years before having to leave due to SFN and what ended up being an entire group of other related diseases. Mental Health industry definitely pushes for a person to be what we see first, and therefore speak of first as well. 

I went out of work 2 years ago and it still drives me crazy but there’s no way I could ever do the work again, or anything productive in the work force again. 

I don’t get offended at all if someone refers to me as a disabled person or as disabled, but it bothers me to hear other people referred to that way. I’ve head so often people referred to as “the wheel chair person” or something like “he is ADHD” or a number of other ways. Regardless I work to always speak in a way that is kind to everyone.
Person first language is heavily used in the mental health field. It is important to remind people that all people deserve to be seen and treated as people, not only as the disability they have. I spent 25 years in the mental health field - 23 of those years as a behavioral specialist. You would likely be surprised how often people need to be reminded that. That said I use it across the board, unless someone has expressed they would like me to say something different.
It makes sense to use it at first until someone says hey I prefer this, given that there really isn’t one exact answer as to which one is the correct phrasing. 
However for me specifically, when I’m talking about myself, using language to help remind people they’re speaking to a human feels weird because like they’re either able to see it or not and I’m not going to be of that much assistance. 

Tbh it feels different in the mental health field because of how incredibly stigmatized it is and the fact that people will use diagnostic labels for mental illnesses as jokes. 
It does feel more dignified to say “person with SUD” than “drug addict”. 

Maybe people needing to be reminded that we’re human is just a sad reality. I just don’t know how much the way I talk about myself can change a person who is so quick to dismiss my personhood. It genuinely seems like that’s something a person would have to do some soul searching about in order to figure out why they’re doing that. 

I don’t really care what way people refer to me, if theyre using PFL that’s probably what they were taught to use and have been saying for years, I’m just throwing a wrench in there and making things more confusing. I’m bipolar and I don’t think u would notice if someone referred to me as a bipolar person or a person who has bipolar disorder. 

But I’m sure the distinction matters significantly to a lot of people and it’s more delicate to use person first in a psych setting. Especially for newly diagnosed individuals. 


In the context of how one chooses to refer to themselves I feel uncomfortable with the idea that someone dehumanizing me would be changed by my verbiage. Most of the time it’s a non issue but I have been corrected on the way I refer to myself before and that was especially irritating because it felt like it was placing the onus on me to convince people I’m human. 
It’s not a simple issue and it does depend a lot on how stigmatized it is, I just don’t feel like making communication clunkier, already so hard to get my thoughts across at all that extra level of complexity is just too much and there’s so much social stuff wound up in just the phrasing of something. Too much.

p0093,popular,mh_wp,Just had the Psych eval for disability...,93,disability,"Husband here.

The man was an absolute ass. He kept making the point that he had a list of questions to answer with limited time so he derided Ren constantly about explanations that he determined were irrelevant to the question being asked. He made jokes from his own perspective and when called out on for using the term Shrink for mental health professionals (which we found to be grossly unprofessional compared to his strict timetable), he doubled down saying that he is one and its a term that gets used between them. ""I have thick skin so it doesn't bother me. I don't see why you're offended by that word.""

I was floored by his inability to speak alongside us in the conversation. It's one thing to stick to a protocol for government work, but this was demanding my spouse be quieted and carved into the correct shape to fit the box while he prattled on about what he found amusing between questions.

The only good things to come out of this are a completed form and the confirmation of diagnoses. And yes, I was very tempted to become violent at his dismissal of the beginnings of a panic attack from Ren. The complete lack of human empathy and the underlying expectation of power and obedience to him was disgusting.
I had a guy who did my evaluation be not only somewhat dismissive but when I got denied and appealed, I looked at his report… he said I had a hair color I don’t, ruddy skin, and my mom was PHYSICALLY WITH ME. At the appointment. I think he was hallucinating because I have a very different hair color, very clear skin, and my mom never left her car. How was she in the office with me?! 

He proceeded to say in this report that dyslexia wasn’t real and it didn’t apply to me. I have documented proof of 25+ years  of MANY multiple people giving me an unquestioned dyslexia diagnosis. He said my mom (who wasn’t there) and I were trying to “convince” him I was disabled. He fucked up my whole evaluation and got me denied. I’ve got a stack of documents, inches thick, documenting over 25+ years of various learning disabilities, mental health problems, and physical health issues.

Adults with disabilities experience higher levels of mental health conditions and substance use than do adults without disabilities.  
  
*What is added by this report?*  
During February–March 2021, 64.1% of surveyed U.S. adults with disabilities reported adverse mental health symptoms or substance use; past-month substance use was higher than that among adults without disabilities (40.6% versus 24.5%, respectively). Among adults with a diagnosis of mental health or substance use conditions, adults with disabilities more frequently (43% versus 35%) reported pandemic-related difficulty accessing related care and medications.

p0097,popular,mh_wp,Do you ever feel that because of your disability that you need to be more ruthless?,92,disability,"I feel like it's possible to be ruth-neutral in this regard. At least, that's what I aim for. I am not usually a dick, but I will do everything I have to do to make sure my situation is understood. For example, making sure everyone in HR knows my diagnoses and their symptoms, in appropriate medical terminology so as to be polite, even when they can't ask about them and don't want to know anyway (and they really, REALLY don't want to know, but I NEED them to know, you know?). Like, if I need some sudden PTO due to needing to see my doctor, then I'll mention what type of doctor it is and what's being treated. (If any of them ask me not to be so detailed because it makes them uncomfortable, then I make sure I know who doesn't like it and won't do it again if I talk to them, but they can't unknow it after I've already spoiled the beans.) Same with the employee calendar -- I'll mark myself out-of-office and explain the same way in the ""Reason"" field.

That's not the only situation in which I feel like it helps, but employment is a good example of needing to cover your ass as much as possible when you have a life-upending condition. I call it ""belligerent disability"", if only for the reason that other people seem to find it rude or downright hostile to discuss health, be it physical or mental health, out in the open and with total candor. There are people (essentially, everyone) who are going to make assumptions about you based on what you do or what you don't do without regard to your illness, because they won't consider it a possibility; the default state is to be well. I gave up being embarrassed or shy some years ago now in matters of health for that very reason: Everyone needs to understand the true nature of disability, how any random person could have a disability, and how expectations of a person's limitations due to disability can be both confirmed and thwarted, even between two people with the same disabiling condition(s).

That said, Theodore Roosevelt once said ""Speak softly, and carry a big stick."" I have the capacity to be ruthless if I have to be. (Insurance comes to mind.) I may never use it, but I like having information and I like planning ahead for possible unpleasant scenarios so I can make them, at the very least, equally unpleasant for the other parties involved. One of the best ways I've found to do this is to make yourself increasingly unpleasant to deal with, by steps so the ratcheting effect is less noticeable, all the while signaling how much easier the other person will have it if they just lay off already. For instance, it seems like the state of Arkansas is freaking the fuck out because I take opipd pain meds and an anti-anxiety medication, and now it looks like I'm going to have to do separate consultation each with my psych, my pain specialist, and my pharmacist. The psych and pain doctors, I've been seeing for years now; they know I have not been abusing either medication, nor other medications in breach of my opiod use contract. They know my entire health record, and how each medication improves my life. They know that potential interactions at the prescribed dosages are not occurring, and have both given me plenty of information each year as required on things to watch out for, such as seizures, respiratory distress, and seratonin syndrome. The only new factor here is the pharmacy, since Walmart recently decided not to fill the pain doctor's medications, as they seem to believe he is prescribing way more than he ought, in spite of the fact that both major medical networks out here have begun requiring primaries and specialists to farm out chronic pain management to pain specialists specifically, so literally every pain management doctor is suddenly doing bigger numbers overall, even if the percentage of prescriptions of varying types does not change for that doctor. So, I think it's thanks to this new place, who gave me quite a lecture over the phone I'm sure I sounded riveted by, that these consultations will be happening. I'll need to make sure the new place has my complete medical history as well.

Sorry, I have nothing bright to add. Just that I strongly relate and I feel your pain.
Thank you. I appreciate your perspective, but disagree that “something is better than nothing” when it comes to therapy. There are plenty of bad therapists, and self-help is sometimes either detrimental or not possible for everyone with certain conditions for various reasons. If you re-read the original post, you’ll see that people are talking specifically about having had therapy, and it not being effective. I’m glad that your abilities allow you to get effective help when you’re desperate, but I think it’s important for people to know that not everyone has that ability, and therapy has limitations and even down-sides. 

There’s a very pervasive culture these days of self-diagnosed “codependency” and confusion about “support vs enabling.” Too many abled people are being taught in therapy and self-help groups/forums to withdraw from relationships where people need support due to disability, under the false premise that someone who doesn’t get therapy for their challenges is being enabled. They are taught to go “no contact” because withdrawal of friend/family support allows the targeted person to reach “rock bottom” where they must seek out help. This is a false and dangerous example of when “therapy” is harmful, and actually becomes a form of abuse/neglect toward the most vulnerable. Not everyone can “think” their way out of their physical and mental health challenges by talking to someone or doing a workbook. Sometimes it’s not negative self-perspective that is the problem, but one of a lack of ability and adequate support.

The waitlists where I'm at take years to get on. If you can try to get a social worker who can help you get an emergency section 8 voucher to avoid homelessness vs an abusive situation. This may be hard if you never pressed charges against your parents for abuse. Otherwise I'd say start preparing to be homeless.

If you can find even the most part time of part time jobs that you can do so you can get your car signed over to you that would be ideal so you can live out of your car. Ots much nicer than living on the street. 

You should qualify for medicaid since your on your own and have no income, although some states have a work requirement. Same with snap. 

Get your disability application in NOW. They can take years to get approved but once you do you get backpay to the date you filed. It took me over 2 years to qualify, with a lawyer, and I got 20k in backpay. I am hemipalegic, a wheelchair user, and have difficulty speaking and mental health issues severe enough to hospitalized me several times and I got denied and had to appeal twice. I couldnt even push my own wheelchair, dress or bathe myself, or communicate effectivly verbally and i still got denied. Make sure all your doctors are on board with you getting on disability or it likely won't happen. 

Work on finding resources now, like where the local homeless shelters are and how to navigate them. Once your on medicaid and if your disabled enough you could also move into a nursing home environment, but you have to be pretty sick to get into those. 

I'd honestly move back in with abusive parents and go back in the closet to avoid being homeless somewhere it gets cold, but that's just me. I can ignore a lot of shit. YMMV. If you get ssi while living woth your parents the amount will be reduced because you aren't paying rent but will go up to $900ish once you move out. 

You could also try and find a job as a live in nanny if you think you could handle taking care of some kids or as a caregiver to another disabled person. My mom has a room she ""rents"" for free just to have someone around to take care of the house amd cook meals amd her last caregiver was disabled just not as disabled as my mom.  

If you have a local center for independent living I'd check them out too. If your on medicaid and ssi there are some alternative housing arrangements for disabled younger people some places. Mostly for ID but you never know unless you ask. 

You may also want to look into your states vocational rehabilitation programs. We have a program here where you live on campus while you do vocational school and voc rehab can help you find a program like that if you think you can handle the training.

Mind you I couldn’t access payment or nothing I met my bf December 2021 and we started dating on his birthday December 8th 2021. So it was a lot of back and forth jumping place to place went to a shelter January to February 2022 and I left again. I been traveling all over my state. And then move with my bf and his family at the end of march and everything was fine but I’m still here but it’s not what I’m trying to do. I became my own payee at end of January 2023 and since I started my payment march 1st and it’s more stressful being my own payee but I’m managing I’m getting my back pay from  Nov 2021 all the way to February 2023. What I’m basically what I’m trying to say even though it’s hard out here I have a faith everything will work out in your favor. Talk with your doctor counselor case manager. Try to get low income housing and stuff like that. Try renting a room from someone in the mean time so u won’t be in the street and you have a roof over your head and so you can shower as well try to be able to get any type of government help like food and cash assistance if you’re able these will help a-lot and best of luck
Well, this is a tough one. I really wish that they had retirement style communities for younger people with disabilities.

I have POTS, hEDS Narcolepsy (shows up with those more frequently than in the general population).

I don't have much advice here, but I do on finding Drs and applying for disability.   I got it without having to appeal. 

I'm 47, and I don't think i could live on my own, and NOT with my family, and I need out of my marriage as it is a disaster and my spouse wont do counseling. 

I plan to call around to social services and see if I can get a case worker to help me find resources.  Sometimes they can help with remote jobs. 

My other thought for Me is to post a roommate ad looking to offer low rent in exchange for help, or another person on disability where we can compensate for each other. 

Sadly, you probably need to move to a new location.   I had to move from Seattle. 

I would call the SSA too, and find out if you qualify for SSI or SSDI.

You are young, but you might have enough credits for SSDI.

I would add to your list of hopes in a job for one that has disability insurance and buy it up, if you can.

If you aren't eligible for SSDI, trying to get enough credits, if you can push yourself enough to get them, is going to help you long term. I went on disability at 27.

If you lost your last job due to your disability, I would talk to an employment lawyer.   Did they offer a disability policy?  Maybe you can still qualify.

Here is info on finding a good Dr for hEDS & dysautonomia. If you live in NC, I can make recommendations.

I would also consider talking to a sleep specialit, if you are having any sleep problems. They can get masked or exacerbate or get mistaken for mental health, though i an NOT discounting your mental health.

If you (or anyone) wants to DM me, I have a bunch of stuff on applying for disabiliy and how to have your best chance of being approved right away.

I also have something on how to ask for accommodations properly...

In addition to a post on finding eds/pots drs that are GOOD.

On the PTSD/mental health, you might want to google Ketamine and depression or PTSD.  Its legit FDA approved, and seems to work well.

So, DM me if you want any of those three things.

p0102,popular,mh_wp,"Is it ableist to refer to people with Down's syndrome as ""younger in the mind""/""mentally younger""?",88,disability,"Well apparently ADHD and Autism are both cases of being ""mentally younger"" which is about what could be expected from neurodevelopmental disorders... however mental age doesn't say much about anything. Mental age merely means that my abilities may be comparable with someone who is younger. It doesn't mean I am incapable of consent or other things related to children. I would only accept the concept under the clause that people understood kids are far smarter than they realise.

So I think these ideas would also port over to Down Syndrome as well in some ways. But only folks with it could really give a fully applicable answer, but I honestly am starting to believe that intelligence is a misunderstood concept in general. Someone with an intellectual disability is not someone who lacks intelligence but merely lacks the ability to make as efficient use of a tool of intelligence. Intelligence is relative to the subject in question and intelligence is an unmeasurable statistic. We can only measure intelligence in regards to subject matter, such as core skills like English, Literacy, Maths, Science, etc.

Perhaps core skills are more useful generally, but I doubt that my inability to do maths in a timely manner means I am incapable of maths, merely my clock time efficiency is lower than it should be because of less working memory as a result of ADHD.

A really good example of the flawed concept of intelligence and mental age... I bet the average 8th grader is more proficient in general or complex mathematics than the average 30 years old. Obviously this doesn't account for the average 30 year old who works in a field which requires complex mathematics... It just comes down to the good old fashioned... ""this maths wont help us in the real world"". The human brain is a sponge, not a hard drive. Sponges dry out eventually without constant practice. This is why elderly people are typically seen as less intelligent... It's literally because they have been retired for 10-30 years. lol

So mental age is merely a comparison metric, otherwise we would be saying certain ethnicities are mentally children compared to their peers. And I merely point it out because the link between Ableism and Racism is pretty solid. What else would all of the bullshit about race and IQ be about?

Perhaps poverty and lack of access to early interventions or supports increases the risk of being ""less intelligent"". At least that's the conclusion made when public education was found to be a huge success for development of core skills. Perhaps many disabled people just haven't been properly included in that system? 🤔

Does this mean the person who cut you off in traffic isn't less intelligent or childish? CORRECT! That's a result of workplace stress! WHICH is a separate topic I will spare others for now.

Just 2 days ago I got denied for a second time. I have autism spectrum disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder.   
  
I had to quit working 5 years ago due to autistic burnout and I didn't even know I was autistic until last year. I had already been going to therapy for 5 years before that. Therapy was a joke, and still is, but I've been forcing myself to go because otherwise I would not get approved. The guy who diagnosed me said that I could probably handle work if I would get on medication. I am against medication for a couple of reasons which I don't need to go into, because the entire point here is that the system is so messed up that the only acceptable way that they will support our need to survive is if we alter our brain chemistry and risk getting side effects. And even then, we are just putting a Band-Aid over a gaping wound and going on like there's nothing wrong. They will not look at the core cause of mental health issues, which are made worse by the system itself.  
  
I also want to agree with the whole entire process in general.  I needed to have my ARMHS worker help me with the paperwork and calling the lawyer and everything else. I can barely make decisions, phone calls, or carry out daily tasks sometimes. And they expect us to be capable of organizing a lifetime's worth of information and paperwork, especially when paperwork is nearly impossible with people with mental health issues. It is mentally draining for anyone to think. It is even more mentally draining for someone with mental health issues to think. It's also mentally draining for someone with mental health issues to do tasks even with somebody helping them. Like you said, we struggle to gather the medical evidence because of our disability. And the way the system is set up, there's nothing we can do about it.  
  
My next step is to schedule a hearing with a judge and this involves way more effort than I've already put in so far, so I'm debating whether or not I even have it in me to keep fighting.

Doesn't make it right, you can be disabled and still be an asshole. They are not mutually exclusive. 

In cases like that, I just try to get away from them. Don't leave it for someone else to be put in a position of ""wanting to go look for some and come back in legal trouble of their own"". Because that doesn't help you, and it really doesn't help whoever goes out looking. 

Best safety tips are ones that apply regardless if you are disabled or not. Simply because they are the most basic things people can do. If you have to, go into a store or building, avoid confrontation. Go towards a crowd, safety in numbers. Make a statement about are you going to calling the police or asking others to do this, as long as they are not the ""Karen"" types they generally will go away fairly fast. If they won't leave you alone. That is absolutely when you call for emergency services, ideally with much distance as possible.

I’m 33 and filed in September of 2019 so I’m excited to have my hearing soon but also terrified of being denied. I will still consider myself disabled if I get denied though because I know myself (I think) and hopefully this will help me keep boundaries for myself so I’ll help myself not go too far.
I'm physically disabled and have C-PTSD. Mental health disabilities are totally valid.  The C-PTSD often disables me more than my physical disabilities.
I have been on disability for my mental heath issues since I was 21. Its hard having an invisible disability and i do get judged a lot but regardless of a govt stamp, you are valid. i wish the world wasnt so fucking hell bent on demonizing all things mental health still. i struggle with identity a lot, tbh and its hard to “look like everyone else” and not FEEL or be able to FUNCTION like “everyone else” around it all.

Is there anything you can do about this type of behavior from others? Yes and no, you need to consider the fact that because they’re not disabled, they don’t get it and just move on. I think the first couple years I was disabled was the hardest.

I can only speak for myself though, and unfortunately I've been in both situations when I felt the impediments  was due to my blindness and others when they were due to the causes. 

I have aniridia, a rare eye condition that has consequences such as ulcerations, cataracts and glaucoma as well.  For now I only have cataracts and a corneal scar on my right eye.   A few years ago  I started getting a lot of ulcerations and it was very painful . I had to leave in the middle of class a lot because I couldn't bare the classroom lights or screens, and just any sort of sensory stimulation made it somehow worse.  I spent a while at home until I finally recovered and stopped having pain, but it was a a major set back in studies and affected my mental health. So, I know what that's like to a certain extent. 

Without the pain,  which would be most of my life, the impediments I've comed across have been caused by the blindness itself.  It's a real shame because glaucoma is such a shitty thing , but I still think there should be a way around it. I know people with glaucoma who manage to do pretty normal activities, they just have to find the way adapt it to their needs.  Perhaps you can't jog but you can do some exercise on a fixed bike, or just gp for long walks . Sure, it isn't as thrilling, but its better than nothing.

p0112,popular,mh_pa,"The older I get, the more I realize Hearing people are the ones disabled and not the Deaf people.",0,deaf,"I agree with your usage of the German word behinderung, ""being obstacled (sic)"". However, you are directing it in the wrong direction. Hearing people are the one suffering from behinderung, that is, via creating policies, procedures, laws, medical models, and many other environmental harms that causes normal Deaf children to become literally cognitively and/or psychologically disabled from linguistic deprivation and/or educational deprivations. 

Don't believe me? Here is a simple snapshot of a disabling world Hearing people created against the Deaf people: 

Google Scholar - [Deaf mental health language deprivation](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C24&q=deaf+mental+health+language+deprivation&oq=Deaf+linguistic+deprivation) 

It is the Hearing populations failure to understand the world in a proper way that causes no harm that makes them disabled and we need to assist them with their disability. One way is by creating threads like this to address it, especially addressing misconceptions such as yours. 

Example: 

1. If Hearing people get bored because of no sounds while driving, then they have been taught poorly on how to drive properly and how to keep themselves properly simulated via environmentally appropriate coping skills that doesn't rely on sounds. That's not the Deaf people's fault but solely on the shoulders of the Hearing world. Even ASL interpreters (mostly CODAs) agrees with this perspective, thus adding weights that even a Hearing person can correct the problems by using Deaf visual solutions. 
2. ""Bigger screens"" = more problems? It actually led to less problems because the screen is big enough to quickly glance at it to grab more information before looking back on the road. The smaller screens were causing a lot of problems, hence the change to bigger screens. Do your research first before making strange claims. 
3. Do you know why I ""generalized""? Because I cannot write a whole thesis on a Reddit page. I expect educated people to understand why I generalized by being able to extrapolate prior point of views and use creative thinking and abstract reasoning abilities to obtain new thoughts and ideas. If you had to accuse me of generalized statements, that only goes to prove that you cannot broaden your own horizon by your own efforts, thus defending your own status quo by making accusations towards people like me who CAN create those kinds of broad ways of thinking. 
4. In fact, here is an example of being able to extrapolate. Is the fact that you socialize with people that can think on a broader horizon because you're unable to do it on your own and need to depend on others to do it for you?

p0114,popular,mh_pa,Disabilities only exist because of society is an ignorant statement made to cope with internalized ableism imo,206,disability,"I consider the terms 'condition', 'impairment, and 'disability to be very different.  As an advocate for Accessibility and Accommodation in the workplace, I help the members of my grassroots community to speak with the policymakers and ensure their concerns are heard.

Depends on the disability. 

Personally, my adhd is something where the problems I face are largely societal. I don’t want a “cure” for myself because I honestly don’t want to be NT. The best thing would be to build systems which are more inclusive. I’m lucky enough to be in a field and in a workplace which suits me well and can capitalize on that difference. 

But my chronic pain and joint injuries are not disabilities because of society. They’re miserable because I’m in pain and I can’t sleep or function when they’re acting up. Yeah they’re way worse because societal factors have frequently made them worse by forcing me to use my limbs and increase my pain anyway, but I’ve been working to cure them for years. 

I’m the middle I’ve got allergies to fragrances (including vapes) and weed. That makes lots of situations around other people potentially deadly. If we as a society didn’t think creating a cloud of fragrance or smoke around you in public spaces was acceptable since it gets into other peoples bodies in potentially harmful ways, I wouldn’t have this issue. But so many people are allergic to different things that I accept eliminating everything that releases compounds into the air is not a reasonable ask. A few hundred years ago, I’d be able to breathe just fine so it’s technically created by society, and many of the issues I face are because of the way different situations are designed. So I need more thought out into how we design airflow in different spaces, but won’t go so far as to claim that my disability there is only based on how disability is treated.
Yeah, the aspie supremacists are quite cringe. Nothing is wrong with feeling empowered by your disability, the problem comes when you try and take it to the point of claiming that autism is a superpower.

I can totally understand how this reactionary ideology came about as a reaction to the demonization of autism by groups like Autism $peaks, but it is basically fighting fire with fire.

Saying ""autism isn't a disability"", is often said by people who forget entire segments of the autistic community that are definitely disabled by having autism. It's cool you're aspie and all but that doesn't mean there aren't people with higher support needs than you. That's basically what I would say to them.

It's also worth noting that aspie supremacy is also anti-disability pride, because aspie supremacy and declaring them to be not disabled is an attempt to distance themselves from the concept of disability. And that is something I simply refuse to accept. Aspie supremacists can do whatever they want... Over there... While the rest of us maintain disability solidarity and the idea that we need unity to stand together.

Neurodiversity is interesting because in a way it is a separate movement but it is alongside disability rights just with the addition of all mental health not just disabilities. Aspie supremacists try and claim the Neurodiversity movement for themselves occasionally but I oppose this strongly because solidarity is more important than *being right all the time.* If we have disagreements or different perspectives, we discuss them cleanly and productivity, we should never ever fight another comrade who believes in solidarity.

As we move forward and we start becoming more organised... We need to remember, what makes us strong is our differences, our experiences are all different, and we have so many unique perspectives. We would be a swiss army knife of an active movement. I hope one day we will be recognised alongside LGBT pride and other large movements. Because if we don't, we won't see the world we want to create.
* condition: we all have them. Nature of life, biodiversity and neurodiversity.
* impairment: if a condition cannot be treated and it leads to limitations in function.
* disability: when a condition or impairment reaches a barrier in home, society, workplace, and it prevents access to services, opportunity, and equity. The barrier in question is often there because of poor design or thoughtlessness of the functional authorities.

These are my definitions for them.

I'm 43/M with CP. The last intimate contact I had with a member of the opposite sex was at the age of 22.

The infantilization of the disabled is a real phenomenon. An interesting (but sad) side effect of that is the fact that it puts most sexual relationships off limits, too. I have never had any real luck with females, mostly because of a culture and social pressure that tells them they can ""do so much better"" than a person in my ""situation"".

I've given up on looking for a partner because repeated rejection took a negative toll on my mental health. I'm a lot better now.

She is physically violent, and verbally abusive - this is not okay anywhere, and certainly not in a workplace. By supporting this behavior the owner is contributing to the creation of a dangerous and toxic workplace. It is a harassment suit waiting to happen. The owner is failing the entire workforce. 

Disability is not a free pass to being an asshole. Honestly, stories like this are damaging to the whole community as they are used to justify not hiring folks who have disability but would meaningfully contribute if allowed reasonable accommodations.
I feel like this person shouldn't be allowed to drive? Or be at a workplace? Since she deliberately puts people at risk and hurts them in these situations? 

Disability isn't a free pass to be abusive and get away with it giggling. 9-12 year olds know that hurting people and animals is wrong. Even toddlers know that it's wrong. If she truly doesn't understand that, she shouldn't be in a work environment putting people in danger, or driving a car. But it sounds like she does know, and just wants to take advantage of the fact that she gets to enjoy a double standard. This is an incredible disservice to all the other people who have to suffer the owner's failure to grow a backbone and protect the workers from an abusive colleague.
This isn't a safe working situation for you and it doesn't sound like it's a safe one for her either. 

You should not be abused in your workplace, regardless of who is doing it. Teachers have every right to refuse actual children who are attacking them. Heck if somehow a literal baby was abusing a staff member and hurting them they would also be booted from the nursery. 

You never have to accept abuse just because somebody doesn't know better. 

Them having cognitive issues gives them the accommodation of you not hitting them back, not of you keeping on accepting their abuse. 


I would talk to your boss and tell them the same thing. That they don't have to continue employing somebody who is abusing their staff and creating a hostile work environment. And actually that they shouldn't. Because by trying to accommodate this one person they are entirely neglecting the rest of their employees. 


Besides it doesn't sound like this person is safe in your workplace if they amputated a digit. That's a huge safeguarding issue if somebody working there is not able to understand that risk. God forbid they hurt somebody else to that extent. Kicking an already injured leg is bad enough.
It is not ableist to expect a disabled employee to adhere to the same standards of conduct and courtesy as a non-disabled employee.    The goal of the ADA and other non-discrimination laws is to level the playing field and treat disabled employees equally, not give preferential treatment to disabled employees.   Yes, a disabled employee is entitled to reasonable accommodations, but the key word here is ""reasonable"".

It is not reasonable to allow a disabled employee to harass, bully, or physically strike out at other employees.  This also ignores the duty of care you have to other employees.   It is not reasonable to basically allow one employee to run roughshod over everyone else and not face consequences.  It is ableist to assume she is incapable of controlling her behavior or shouldn't have consequences.

You are sending mixed signals when you don't correct her firmly every time her behavior is unacceptable or she uses physical violence, because you're afraid of making her mad or hurting her feelings.   ""Rarely"" addressing her behavior, letting her hit AT ALL, or backing down because she throws a tantrum just sends the message that she can get away with doing these things.  She doesn't know where the boundaries are because you keep redrawing the lines.

Develop an employee code of conduct.  Put clear expectations in writing and have everyone sign it so she isn't singled out.  Then enforce it, consistently, every single time.

And some things should be ZERO tolerance regardless of her level of cognitive ability.  Treating an animal or child roughly; hitting or striking another employee; threatening physical violence.  That behavior would not be accepted in any other employee - stop accepting it from her.   If your boss is unwilling to make the hard choices here, point out to him that he's been lucky not to have been sued already, and at some point, his luck is going to run out.

I assume you are in the U.S. - in which case you're very lucky not to have been investigated for OSHA violations if the amputated digit was a workplace incident.   If this employee has the cognitive level of a child and her employers know this, allowing her anywhere near dangerous equipment is reckless at best, and willful endangerment at worst.

A local mom and pop grocery in my area got slapped with a significant fine for allowing an ID employee to operate a meat slicing machine in their deli.

p0131,popular,mh_pa,Client is emotionally dependent on us personal care assistants,7,disability,"I see that and acknowledge that. Thing is, we are with him 8-12h every day and in order to do our job professionally some sort of boundaries need to be in place. 

We are to be friendly and understanding with our clients but we are not to replace a social circle, friends, family. The reasons for that are the possibility of burnout on our end, or depression if a client passes away. On the other hand, when a client is emotionally dependent on us and too attached there is danger of abuse, I have heard of cases like this in health care, when caretakers take advantage of someone. 

Furthermore, would you really like a caretaker / assistant to not assist but rather influence your life to the point you feel lost and helpless when you are without them? Wouldn’t it be much better if you would let an assistant help you with your daily tasks while being as self sufficient as possible? Having real Friends of your own? If you feel blue and don’t know what to do with yourself, wouldn’t you want to talk to a professional about it and work on it with them? We are not psychologists or social workers and not only may we not provide such help because we aren’t trained in it, it is highly unadvised to do all this, we simply lack the expertise. 

I can’t be an assistant, a motherly figure, a buddy, a psychiatrist, a chef, a comedian, expert for official affairs, the person who cleans you or gives you a respirator while also being an entertainer, nobody can be all that at once. I saw too many colleague’s quit this occupation due to burnout. Boundaries can start to blur when you are so close to someone all day every day, but we really gotta be careful that this doesn’t happen. The social aspect and the mental health aspect as well as the physical / psychological aid, those are tasks that need to be spread and shared among people. All clients except for him understand that. I want him to not dread being with himself for a bit and to find something for himself that makes him happy. My clients can’t be my friends. Happened to me once and when he died I was broken for months. We are friendly, but I could quit this job tomorrow or he could get fewer hours of PCA next year. I might be replaced by someone who isn’t as chatty and he becomes lost and depressed. Or someone who is SO friendly, it’s borderline grooming. God forbid any of our clients crave so much closeness they end up being taken advantage of. 

So to answer your question, it’s not too much of him to crave human connection. However, there is a reason why in society we have several roles that are separate. Your wife can’t be your mother, your workmate can’t be your psychiatrist outside of working hours, you can’t be romantic with your children. We try all we can to encourage him and take opportunities that are available to him so that he can live a fulfilling life, but he denies. He wants to rely on us playing all the roles in his life.

p0134,recent,mh_wp,My father has done next to nothing for the past two years,1,Blind,"So to start with, I am 54 and became legally blind two years ago. So much of this resonates with me. I am not at all trying to judge your father because this is brutal and I get how he feels.

This all sounds like a form of depression that is very familiar to me, and if a few things were different in my case I could definitely imagine myself getting into the same kind of state. There is a brutal downward spiral effect that just sucked every ounce of willpower and determination out of me on so many days, and whenever it went on for more a day it would get rapidly worse. If things had gone a little differently for me, I could see those days turning into weeks and then months. It is entirely possible that your dad needs mental health professionals helping him at this point, because it just can get that bad. You all might need to get together for a little intervention to get him to seek this help. My prediction would be that he won’t do it independently at this point and will probably be very resistant to the idea. Hopefully you can all come together and show him that you are truly with him and want him to have help.

I went through something similar very recently with another family member who needed that kind of help, and it was not fun. This is going to suck. But from my own experience with these feelings and from what you’re describing, this is probably something that he needs you to do for him.

Now, there is a whole other aspect to this that is also worth investigating, because it sounds like your father needs to cultivate some blind life skills that will help him regain his independence and self identity that he so badly needs right now. I believe that at a certain level of visual impairment you need to develop blind skills or spend the rest of your life thinking everything is closed off to you. I have pretty good acuity for a legally blind person but enough problems to make me have to do almost everything the blind way, as much as possible, so that I can use my little bit of vision for the things it is still good for. I can’t read long text, get very little out of screens and can’t do any fine work visually. I have to use screen readers for everything tech-related and other assistive tech and alternative techniques for everything else. Using these tools is what helps me keep working, keep paying bills, be on the Web and every kind of self fulfillment. Without them I would probably be in exactly the same place as your dad. So, is he using any assistive tech and learning blind life skills? Has he had any kind of assistance from vocational rehab? BESB? Is he using a cane or screen readers?

My guess would be that he is a bit resistant to these things and is trying to do everything like he would as a fully sighted person, which is probably really holding him back. A lot of people our age would try to deny how visually impaired they really are and stay away from all the assistive tech that could free them. This is something that talking to other low vision people could help with, as I’m pretty sure the results are fairly self evident. You just can’t be successful at life as a blind person if you keep on denying that you’re blind.

(I am doing a lot of guessing at he state of his vision here, but even if he is not legally blind he may have enough of a visual impairment that a lot of these things could help him. Canes, for example, aren’t only for the blind. There are quite a few people who are not legally blind but can still benefit from using a cane in situations that require it.)

I think this is a very hard road ahead for all of you, but he needs to get out of that spiral before it’s too late. Please get him talking to other B/VI people and/or mental health professionals. I am happy to talk to any of you in DMs if it will help, but what I really think would help most is real life contact, not a random weirdo on Reddit. (This is also a guess, but I’m guessing that if he was inclined to look for support from Reddit he would already be here.)
Thank you. Your response was very thorough and your assumptions were accurate. I think we do need to bring the focus back to mental health, community and therapy.

Have I mentioned I am a therapist? Lol. I do not attempt to do work on my family, way too exhausting. 

He also is very resistant to using technology. I have mentioned screen readers before and he mentions how embarrassing that would be (but shoving your face into your phone to read a text is not? Lol)

Find your state's disability advocate/employment aid and discuss your mental health needs with them.

As an example, in Texas, it's known as Texas Workforce. My aide/advocate helped me get recommended into the Austin center's waiting list. There have been some disappointments with loss of communication and missed messages regarding O&M and tech, but that's been on me.

She did help me find a local support group of visually impaired folk to talk about troubles and generally bitch when things like power outages happen or the mute Domino's driver tries to wave a piza in my face so I'll take it...

p0149,recent,mh_wp,TO guide dog or not to guide dog.,7,Blind,"Do you mean emotional support animal as in one that goes with you everywhere?

Pets can definitely be good for mental health and emotions, whether that’s a dog, cat, or anything else. And I’m definitely not going to hate on someone who has a pet for the benefit of their mental health. 

The problem with emotional support animals is that there are no training standards. Someone can buy a vest online, and slap it on their ill-behaved pet, and take them places. And I’m talking dog that barks or lunges at other people, dog that poops inside, or dog that is otherwise disruptive. 

Understandably, business owners don’t want a dog in their establishment who is going to poop on the floor or jump up on other customers. And they may, not knowing the difference, assume guide dogs and other service dogs are equivalent, and refuse them service (even when they legally can’t). Thus, the poorly trained ESA makes it more difficult for trained service dog teams. 

As far as I’m concerned, if ESAs were trained to the same high standards of service dogs, I wouldn’t care about them. I don’t even really care if someone takes their well-trained pet with them. As long as the dog isn’t making a mess or being disruptive, it doesn’t bother me, whether they’re doing a specific job, or not. 

However, as long as there’s no training standard for emotional support animals, and people use it as an excuse to try and take their badly behaved pet with them, the whole thing is going to be a problem to guide dog handlers. 

BTW, I’m not a guide dog handler myself. I would like to get one in the future but don’t currently have a lifestyle where I would make good use of a dog.
No, I don’t want one that goes with me everywhere. A service dog that did travel with me on certain occasions would be a benefit, however that’s not something I want every day. I understand the repercussions of having a poorly trained E S A. That is why I want to go down the avenue of a service animal for mental health support rather than a dog guide.
Perhaps emotional support is not the word I'm looking for. There are dogs for mental health, and do bare in mind that laws in different places aren't the same as the US.
If I wanted a guide dog, I would have a guide dog. As I explained in my initial post, I don't always want to be traveling with the dog. There are days when I barely remember to take my house keys and all the other important stuff. If I can barely focus on myself and where I need to go, how can I also focus on keeping anyone else safe? People approaching me is something else I don't handle, hense not wanting a dog guide. If I'm going somewhere, I want to get from point A to Point B with was few distractions as possible.
Of course, your O&M skills have to be good to have a dog guide. I believe that my skills are sufficient enough and provide me enough independence that I don't require a dog. As I stated in a previous comment, there would be times more often than not where I would be doing the dogs work for them, making the job of the dog almost redundant.
If a mental health provider or other medical provider involved in your care writes you a letter stating you medically need the dog as part of your treatment plan, that ESA dog is protected the same way a service dog is, at least in the US.

Gap Quarter (Gap Year?),6,Blind,"I'm blind in my left eye, been that way since birth, and usually when i go out in public, i wear an eye patch and people usually don't really bring it up or say anything about it. So in regards to that, based off my own experiences, it shouldn't really be an issue. Though if like me, you end up using a white cane to help with ""seeing"" on your blind side and the lack of depth perception, expect people to be super awkward and weird about it and just always assume you have less sight than you actually do and people seem to always notice the cane and never notice the eye patch, at least in my experience. But if using a white cane helps you, don't let how others react to the cane discourage you, though I do realize that's significantly easier said than done. And if others are super weird and awkward about you using a white cane, getting a cane that's customized to be colors you like/to fit your aesthetic will help a lot in making other people less awkward and weird about it and in improving your confidence/willingness to use it.

p0154,recent,mh_wp,seeking braille fulltime.,10,Blind,"You can modify all screen readers to do things similarly to the Braillenote.  For example the students I teach who come from the Touch like to check their power with enter&p, their time with enter&t and so on. They're familiar commands that let them move to Windows or whatever with less of a jarring change.

Unfortunately a Braillenote won't get you terribly far in many workplaces. I'm afraid you do need to consider moving to some more mainstream tech.  For all the Braillenote is a neat idea, they are not a one-stop solution for life. Every app in KeySoft is so cut down as to make it useless for adults who need to lead fulfilling, productive, employed lives. The evidence for this is simple; they had to move from KeyWeb, a cut-down web browser, to something more mainstream to keep up.  
you can probably bury your head in the sand and pass at college or whatever because 1, people may feel you can't move to something new and, 2, they'll believe Humanware's marketing that the BrailleNote is a modern, powerful and all-in-one solution for productivity.  But I've never seen a respected colleague using one exclusively. Sure, some people use them for noettaking, some even check their emails now and then, and a very few people browse the web with them.  But everyone with whom I work as an adult who is blind can also use an iPad, or a phone, or a computer of some sort to do the things where the Braillenote falls down. 
With a Braillenote, you won't be able to collaborate with sighted colleagues on a presentation or a document in real time.  You won't be able to access the vast majority of online training materials an employer might require you to undertake. You'll struggle to react to suggestions from colleagues on your own documents or to track changes and make comments or suggestions in theirs. You'll find almost any online platform - for timesheets, tech support tickets, live chat, knowledge-base work or any number of other things difficult and, unless you're going to lug around a computer monitor, nobody's going to see what you're doing as you do it or work side-by-side with you on something.

I'm not saying give up Braille by any means, but learn to use it with hardware that the rest of the world uses too. That way, if your phone or computer dies, you can connect your Braille to another one.  If there's a necessary upgrade or change, everyone else will be going through it too. And if the Braille device itself dies, you can rely temporarily on using Braille Screen input, or 6key entry on a qwerty keyboard. So many more options if you untie yourself from Humanwares handholding, expensive, underpowered, inefficient and dumbed-down system.
Perhaps we just see things. Differently.
I’m no voc rehab teacher or anything, but you’re going to need JAWS to be successful in college and in the workplace. I would recommend having a laptop with JAWS and a Braille display so you still have tactile feedback. You may need further training to use the computer if you’re not used to it. If you can get a Braille display funded, I would go for one that’s a hybrid like the Brailliant, because I assume you’re quicker at typing with a Perkins keyboard rather than a computer keyboard and if that’s the case, that’ll be really beneficial during lectures.
I don't see what's wrong with humanware system



Maybe it's because I've been raised on it but I kind of love the way the humanware devices work and none of the other screen readers have the three metal buttons that the brown notes have which are the most convenient things ever when paired with a thumb keys and everything I can navigate it so quickly



You brought up key web and how that's proof that they don't advance but I think it's proof they do advance because they did switch over to Chrome and a whole bunch of other things and it works really good on Chrome I've used it so they can catch up and keep up with other technology



What is it exactly that would leave me out of most workplaces honestly someone mentioned the example of needing to play a disc or something but I don't think most workplace is used those



And I'm not really looking for a job in corporate America anyway as I'd rather do something more creative



Besides there's workplace life and then there's personal life isn't there



I could still use one for my all my personal everything and maybe have a backup that I could use for a workplace job if I really needed one




And I'm sure I could work around jobs that would make it completely non-viable I already will have to ask for accommodations anyway  lots of people don't take jobs where they have to do something they aren't comfortable with


There's a whole wide world out there I'm sure I could work with something 


There's got to be something out there I can do
The Braille Note touch plus has full internet connectivity

It can access pretty much any app my phone can

I'm sorry I thought I was facing I guess I forgot to press the line twice every time most Reddit posts seem to have everything they write in spaced out when my reader reads them

As for job it's not about John specifically it's about the idea of a computer without any access to Braille

I can do some basic job enough that I can use the computer and probably an emergency if I need to but I don't want it to be my main device for the rest of my life

Especially not for anything important I might want to do they say I might not be able to use the device I want for every job but ... Well the field I want to go in I I probably be a better writer if I could use braille and not a computer that made me uncomfortable so if I want to be a writer Braille would be more beneficial than a computer
And if I want to be a voice actor which is another career path I've been considering since people have scared me into not wanting to write anymore I don't see how a computer would change me being able to record myself I could do that just if easily on the Braille device

It's hardly a slate and chisel as mentioned it connects to the internet and runs every other app just fine it's not as if I'm deciding I'd rather run on a Perkins or even a mountbatten or even an apex or even a braille Note touch all of which are somewhat outdated 

The brown Note touch Plus is a perfectly usable modern device that they don't want to give me because and I swear I'm not making this up

I won't be able to change the font on PowerPoints I'll need to do for college presentations

At least that was the argument the use for switching me to job mid-school year

Just about the only important thing that that device wouldn't be able to do we have to place a phone call and I do have a phone for that

Anything else it wouldn't be able to do probably isn't important to my day-to-day life

And therefore for the personal device I want to live the rest of my life using I don't see why I couldn't use this one other than the fact that the provider won't give me one because they say it won't be useful for as you said every possible job

I guess this resource is very specifically about getting a job but I thought part of it was also about living independently which this would apply to

And I could look for jobs I could do with it

If a blind person I'm already used to be idea that there are certain jobs I won't be able to do because of me being blind and me using advice that couldn't do a certain thing I'll just add to the list of reasons why I couldn't do a certain job

But you'd think if they weren't going to let people use these devices they wouldn't actually provide them and raise kids on them their entire lives

I need to have a physical connection with my words in order to write and feel comfortable with it audio only doesn't really work with me even now I'm using my microphone on my phone to dictate what I'm saying and I'm worried that it's not working because it has a history of sucking but going back to edit it would be a pain I'd have to go line by line word by word character by character with individual little swipes if I was using Braille I probably could have written and posted this comment minutes ago I'm much faster at it it's more convenient it works better and I feel more comfortable with it and safer it

If I was stuck on a computer for the rest of my life it would pretty much destroy my sense of Independence and make every interaction with technology uncomfortable which isn't what I want for the rest of my life

I know it's pathetic but yeah the specific devices actually important to my mental health it always gets worse on summer break when I have to use my phone and don't have access to Braille

Call me a dinosaur if you'd like but I do think that device is relatively modern and in fact I'm pretty sure it's a lot newer than Windows computers or the Jaws program
I did use double lines


And there's plenty they can do


I've been on one for years trust me there's a lot you can do with them if you know how to use them correctly plus they might have changed it a bit since whenever you did did it since they do adapt




And there's a difference between learning to adapt and completely changing your entire system for no real reason



And personal preference and mental health aren't just excuses I mean it's so much more than that 


If the position was reversed and they you were told you could only ever use a braille note and couldn't use a computer you wouldn't be thrilled is that just a preference or would you learn to adapt



It's one thing if there's a reason to adapt like I said I've gone through about five different stages of device through my lifetime


But it's another thing to switch all together notice those five different devices I'll use a Perkins keyboard all you similar systems all you similar operating


Lord adapt means to alter something to fit a new environment not to throw away everything for something completely new that has nothing to do with anything else and no connection to the previous anything whatsoever that's more than adapting


Looks like expecting someone to go straight from a landline to a smartphone without something in between or sometime to get the hang of it



What is it exactly that you think this device can't do that's so important that I need to change everything to get it instead



Cuz it can access the internet and work with a good amount of speed it can send emails it can access any app on the Android play store and it has a really good keyword editor that allows me to save and monitor and access all my files that I have on my flash drive
It has Braille and an accessible and easy to learn system with the thumb keys and the cursor routing keys and the e chords and everything else that another device from another system wouldn't know wouldn't have
It's faster and more convenient and doesn't have a slow robot voice
It has a neat screen under the keys that a fighter person could look at or that you could use touch Braille with if you needed to so it wouldn't cut you off from any sighted people
It can connect to a large monitor if absolutely necessary if the screen is too small
you can use apps like Google sheets for when you need to make PowerPoints although I admit it not great with PDF but a PDF is kind of recited people anyway and I can just get it changed to a keyword document if I need the information
It can download attachment from emails easily
It comes with a neat book reader and you can install any others that you want to get a hold of
You can turn speech on and off and still use braille if you don't want there to be any sound so you're not locked to audio only and you can actually multitask and listen to music or something while writing which with any device that wouldn't let you use braille you wouldn't be able to do because you'd have to have the audio
It provides fast neat and convenient editing you can move through lines quickly or jump straight to whatever word you're looking for pop the cursive around wherever you need to and don't have to swipe character by character up and down with a fingernail or by pressing the arrow keys
I could go on but seriously what is it lacking but so important that means it's a device I can never use for the rest of my life?


what is it about the life-eyed lead that would be so impossible that I have to change and get a computer that give me anxiety


Please I'm very curious to know if these people who say I'm living in the past have a legitimate argument or not because so far I haven't heard one that actually made sense


And if you had brio you could probably read at a different pace and not have to deal with your screen reader apparently not being able to read spaced out lines maybe something's wrong with your screen reader because I am using double lines as you requested seems like your screen reader is not great

But go on please tell me why your screen reader is better than being able to read what's on screen so you can tell where the punctuation is and how the words are spelled and which words are being used

I'm very curious and would love to know since I haven't found any major problems in my life that I think I need to fix and so far there's nothing really big missing from it other than the fact that some fighting things I can't do like look at pictures and play video games but I don't think that's something that can be solved by changing devices
It's not childish


I don't like my mom then anytime you get sick or upset I'm just making it up in my head


Okay I'm not making up the fact that whenever I have to use the computer I start getting nervous and my chest hurts tightening and I breathe faster



Huge screen gives me trust issues before anyone's even near me



I'm not making up the fact that I'm faster trail or feel safer with a braillenote


Just because I know my limits and I've considered them and I'm going to try and work around them like how any disabled person works around any form of their disability doesn't mean I'm being childish


Or is it childish truth refused to get surgery to get their your eyesight back rather than staying blind


Should we all just get cured and change our entire life because I'd be more convenient for everybody else right


Control no one's going to hire a blind truck driver so if you want that job you better go get eyesight back


And if that's not the job you want for your life that doesn't matter you should do it anyway



Do you hear how dumb that sounds



This is the same thing okay



It's not being childish to take the few steps necessary to preserve some of my mental health when I'm definitely not going to be getting therapy because it's too expensive and probably won't do anything anyway


But instead I can work on it myself and try to take the stuff to necessary to make sure I'm actually happy



I can work with or around what I need to I've been doing that my entire life


Why should I stop now


I'm not going to become excited even though my mom wants me to is that also being childish and refusing to change cuz she thinks my life would be better if I could see


Send how many people are upset by the mere concept of forcing someone to have their disabilities erased even in fiction for some reason I doubt that


So how about we stop shoving mental health aside like it doesn't matter and treat it like it's just as valid as the any physical disability


Thanks
This is a sighted world. How a document looks makes it easier to read which is very important in the workplace. Actually, it’s very important everywhere. I hear your various arguments but the bottom line is if you’re planning on being a successful adult you are going to have to make some changes. It is not easy learning things that we have no interest in but, if you’re planning on joining the workforce , knowing JAWS is a necessary step to getting a decent job in an office environment for most visually impaired people. You don’t have to do it. But don’t expect the world to adjust to your stubbornness. We all like to use the devices we like to use, but if circumstances call for us to change we have to adapt.

It did change my life. For a long time, I just didn’t think I “needed” them. But it was very isolating and anxiety-inducing being left out of conversations at home and in public, not to mention how exhausting it was to try and keep up with conversations I couldn’t hear. There’s also a lot of research on HAs and brain health (minimizes risk of dementia), so that alone is a big factor for me too since my hearing is progressively getting worse. 

As for the internalized ableism, your family, and the stubbornness: I’m sorry your family hasn’t been supportive of your other disabilities. I had to learn how to be my own advocate over the years. I feel that I am still learning too. After I got HAs, I followed a bunch of Deaf advocates online. You can have HAs and still continue learning ASL.They have really nice ones that are very discreet. I work with children and families as a mental health therapist, and almost all of my families have never noticed my HAs.

The same goes for Dr. Gulati, except that he is a psychiatrist and he is Deaf himself.

I will tell you that this is a unique subfield, and it can get very complex. This is because psychology and psychiatry and just therapy and mental health in general is the most linguistic experience a person can ever have, probably. And many of the patients have been victims of a society that does not recognize or promote their language in its natural form, something the rest of the world doesn't have to worry about. Most therapists, for example, have never encountered someone who can't readily converse with their own parent or sibling or colleague, for example.

I have the contact number and email for the relay service and I will DM you with those details.
I would recommend you use a TTY or text relay service as these are used by both DdHH people and those with speech difficulties or who are non/semi verbal (I fit both categories and it works well for me, especially since I'm not fluent in my country's sign language and English is easier to communicate with).

I don't know if this is available in the US (I think it's available in some places?), but over here you can register to text emergency services which could also be helpful when there is a crisis and you cannot talk or find it difficult. After the quick registration, you can text them from your phone.

There's also a text crisis service called SHOUT here which is the same as a mental health crisis helpline but in text messages and it works fine for me. Maybe there's a similar thing in the US.

p0189,recent,mh_wp,"I’m becoming bitter at a friend calling themselves disabled, and I don’t like it",152,disability,"I always say ""it's not the disability olympics"".  It seems like for whatever reason your friend feels the need to compare your situation and symptoms to theirs every time you bring something up, and I GET why that makes you uncomfortable, and pushes you further into being uncomfortable with them labeling common dx that would not typically be considered disabling by the medical community as disabling to them. It probably feels like they are coopting that identity for themselves, when you've just barely gotten used to it for you.

A few things that might help- you seem to be pretty certain this friend actually does have pain and isn't simply malingering. Remind yourself that they may be clinging to your symptoms so hard, because their own common dxs that they have been given so far might not adequately explain the volume and type of pain they perceive. There might be more going on for them the they are able to get dx'd at the moment. There may be mental health complications that are making the physical issues they experience significantly more difficult to navigate.

Most importantly though, I have found with people like this, it's important to validate their experience repeatedly and obviously: I tell them that yeah, that really sucks and must be difficult, that I can't understand their particular pain/symptom because mine is different, but that that doesn't really matter because pain is pain symptoms are symptoms, one type isn't worse or better than the other because any kind of pain or symptoms make life hard to navigate. That I can't compare my pain to theirs because that's apples to oranges BUT that I empathize that they struggle with pain, and all types of pain suck. It takes time (months often), but usually the person stops competing their symptoms against mine, instead simply discussing what they actually struggle with, and asking what I do.

Sometimes, none of that works and I just straight up refuse to discuss my health with the person any more. If they bring it up, I say thanks for asking but I'd rather not discuss it right now and would prefer to discuss only happy topics. Then I immediately change the subject (its very helpful to have anyone else you hang out with also on this plan if you go this route- my husband knows the people who fall in this category and backs me up). If they bring up their own health, I also politely say, I'm sorry you are dealing with that--and then immediately change the subject. They eventually figure out the topic is off the table.

It's about THEM and ultimately has very little to do with you. The reason they choose to identify as disabled isn't something you are entitled to or can change - even if they are genuinely malingering - but you can change how you respond to it, and in no way are you required to participate in the disability olympics. That takes way too much energy!
Something to keep in mind is doing the appointments themselves and not keeping up with the homework might just be all they’re capable of doing. Especially if they’re neurodivergent consistency issues is probably a part of them being disabled. It definitely is for me and I had to quit PT because of the amount of shame/guilt and annoyance I got from the therapist for that exact issue. It really sucks cause I definitely need the therapy.

Idk what their exact issues are but a lot of things have to be self diagnosed in order to get a formal disagnosis as access to practitioners is difficult and sometimes impossible. If I hadn’t self diagnosed my autism I probably never would’ve gotten an official appointment.

Idk if that helps the emotions or not but I hope it at least helps with some perspective.

You also might just be providing actual information they don’t know how to get otherwise so they see it as really helpful and are saying it partially as a “hey thanks I didn’t know about this. It feels familiar”

I think talking with them is an important step cause it sounds like they’re not aware at all. And maybe talking with a therapist as well if you haven’t already. I can understand it being annoying and downright distressing so taking care of your own mental health is important also.

It’s not necessarily anyone’s fault or “problem” you might just need additional emotional support around it which is really important. And they might need an explanation cause they sound oblivious and are likely unaware of the harm it’s causing.

Even just something simple like “hey I’m glad I’m able to help with perspective and information but when I talk about specifics like this I’m usually looking for emotional support instead of comparison and sometimes the immediate jump to how you feel about it can be hurtful when I need support.”

Your feelings are definitely valid either way also like your feelings are telling you important stuff and it’s important to listen to them fully and figure out what they’re trying to tell you even if you don’t talk directly about it to your friend.l about the specifics.
While I agree that disability isn't a competition (I think we can all agree that would be one crappy comp), it sounds to me as if they might have just one mental health disorder. One super-specific one. I won't mention it here, because I'm not a PhD of Psychology, but it sounds as though this person should get checked out for their mental health for this exact reason. 

Encourage them, tell them that the psychologist would love to hear about all the diagnoses they've gotten, how they're taking care of themselves with them, and how much of a struggle it is to find out that yet another new ailment they've never heard of has been ""found"" to be affecting them. Trust those of us who have been to a real psych doc, there's no way your friend will get out of that room without the diagnosis of this one particular mental health issue. 

After that, for them, it will be far harder to convince any doctor that something else new is happening with their health, unless the doctor comes to that conclusion themselves. And you will finally have the peace of mind in knowing that your friend is actually disabled, so I guess you ""win""?

Or the easier way, stop being friends. You aren't in a good headspace to handle them, and they just want a sounding board for all their perceived ailments. It's unhealthy for both of you, and since they're obviously more needful of your time than you are of theirs, you have to be the one to cut the cord.
That’s happened to me too.  I’ve had multiple mental health professionals fire me as their patient because they said I was too difficult to work with.  It honestly really triggered my PTSD.  When I think about it, I try to tell myself that the real problem wasn’t that I’m too difficult, but that they clearly didn’t have the experience/expertise/education on my specific conditions to properly help me.  When a mental health professional says something like that what it really means is that they’re not good enough at their job to treat you, not that you are a bad person or a failure somehow 
That's really cool. I'm glad you enjoyed the experience so much. I prefer reading books and stuff to dealing college campuses though. lol. I think although going the psychology special interest route might be a particularly challenging path, I'd say it becomes invaluable. Versus learning communication skills without having as much foundational understanding of why it's effective on most people.

Granted, it's not really fair to expect every autistic person to devote years of their life to studying human psychology to mesh better with society. So I feel like I've gone around in a circle to some extent where the original intent was to essentially get really good at masking (even in private out of internalized ableism), and now I understand enough about psychology to know that level of masking is detrimental to my mental health and so I do it less.

I'm still trying to strike that balance between being safe and being myself because while ex: rocking back and forth when stressed hurts absolutely no one, it absolutely does draw a lot of unwanted and potentially even dangerous attention.

p0190,recent,mh_wp,How to Get a Mental Health Evaluation Abroad Recognized for U.S. Disability Support?,1,disability,"If you are talking about Social Security disability, there are two different programs.  The first is SSDI - Social Security Disability Insurance.  This is the disability coverage your FICA taxes go toward.   Generally, an adult who has never worked or paid into the Social Security system (and thus never earned work credits) is not eligible for SSDI.  There is a limited exception called DAC (disabled adult child) benefits, where someone who became disabled before age 22 can draw SSDI based on a parent's earning record.  However, DAC benefits can only be paid if the parent is already drawing SS disability or retirement benefits, or is deceased.  So even if it were established that David became disabled before the age cutoff, he still would not receive benefits until you start drawing retirement or disability benefits yourself, or you predecease him.   

The other disability program is SSI - Supplemental Security Income for the blind, elderly and disabled.  It is a means-tested program with very strict income and asset limits for eligibility, and the most it pays is currently less than $950 per month.   He will not be eligible for SSI unless he was actually living in the U.S.  

I'm unsure of the answer to your question about disability evaluations conducted by a non U.S. physician, but I suspect the answer is they would not be enough for Social Security purposes.   To qualify for social security disability, the claimant needs very complete, compelling medical documentation.  This is especially true for mental health issues.  

There are other programs such as Medicaid for which David might become eligible if he lived in the U.S., but these programs vary a lot by state, so you would need to look at what's available specifically in your state. 

Given the complexity of David's situation, I would highly recommend that you consult with an attorney knowledgeable about disability issues, especially about estate/life care planning for the needs of a disabled adult child.  

Have you talked to David about whether he wants to come to live with you, or to live in the U.S.?  It seems like this would be the most important first step to take.  As David would be considered an adult in the U.S., you would not have the right to make decisions on his behalf.  If you believe he is unable to make his own medical, financial and legal decisions, you may need to consider seeking guardianship or conservatorship.  At minimum, you would need to hold his power of attorney and health care proxy in order to apply for services on his behalf or be involved in medical decision making.",talking social security disability two different program first ssdi social security disability insurance disability coverage fica tax go toward generally adult never worked paid social security system thus never earned work credit eligible ssdi limited exception called dac disabled adult child benefit someone became disabled age draw ssdi based parent earning record however dac benefit paid parent already drawing s disability retirement benefit deceased even established david became disabled age cutoff still would receive benefit start drawing retirement disability benefit predecease disability program ssi supplemental security income blind elderly disabled meanstested program strict income asset limit eligibility pay currently less per month eligible ssi unless actually living u im unsure answer question disability evaluation conducted non u physician suspect answer would enough social security purpose qualify social security disability claimant need complete compelling medical documentation especially true mental health issue program medicaid david might become eligible lived u program vary lot state would need look whats available specifically state given complexity david situation would highly recommend consult attorney knowledgeable disability issue especially estatelife care planning need disabled adult child talked david whether want come live live u seems like would important first step take david would considered adult u would right make decision behalf believe unable make medical financial legal decision may need consider seeking guardianship conservatorship minimum would need hold power attorney health care proxy order apply service behalf involved medical decision making,positive,0.196,0.759,0.045,0.9892,0.06043184548616409,0.40627917647361755,0.5332889556884766,neutral
p0191,recent,mh_wp,Is this Disability Discrimination (UK)?,0,disability,"I am unsure if it's discrimination, but comparing a non physical access need to a physical access need doesn't help your case. I'm not saying PTSD is easy, or not an impairment - but you are able to physically access the building, and a physically impaired person is simply not.

It'd work better to frame this entirely within a mental health accessibility context, as these are simply different problems with different managements.

I'll also say under UK law, it's about whether or not your access requirement is deemed ""reasonable"" by the organisation providing the access. They'll argue that they have provided reasonable access measures most likely, so going forward with discrimination is unlikely to get you anywhere.

Hopefully PALS can help you find a solution though!
I am in the US so I'm not talking about UK law, although we share a common legal ancestry and sometimes share precedent. I am only sharing my experiences and what can be, in my country, considered undue burden. Your legal system also uses the same ""reasonable"" terminology as the US and your Equality Act explicitly states that discrimination is unlawful *unless there is good reason*.

My husband died in a hospital in my city. It was deeply traumatizing. I need to receive a specific medical treatment there every quarter. When I asked it be moved to a different hospital in my city, in the same hospital system, I was denied. My provider doesn't work at the hospital and the treatment I receive isn't provided there - I need to go to the specific specialty clinic to receive my treatment. I worked with my therapist at the time to develop coping strategies to learn to manage being in the same hospital where he died.

I think it's worthwhile to ask if there is a reason it needs to be at this specific hospital, but I also think it's important to be aware of hierarchies of power, whether we find them just or unjust, and function accordingly. If you need this medical care and the people with the power to provide you the medical care will only provide it at this singular location, it might be an option to work with your mental health care team to develop coping strategies around this specific trigger (grounding techniques, EMDR, being accompanied by someone to support and guide you through the current moment, etc).
I don’t think you fully understand, and to be fair that’s my fault for making not making it clear. I have tried to access the building with support of mental health professionals and suffered a psychotic break in the process, harming myself and trying to harm others. The building is not only inaccessible for me, it’s dangerous to myself and others.

There have provided no access measures at all to tackle the issue. It’s not an issue with the department or what will happen at the appointment. It’s an issue with the building. So don’t know how that would be considered reasonable.

I think the comparison to physical disabilities is a tricky one, personally, I think they are often taken more seriously than mental disabilities and it helps me get the point across that in the eyes of the law they should be the same.
I’m way past the point of grounding techniques helping. Being there with someone does not help, we have tried. I have suffered a psychotic break trying to get into that building supported by two mental health nurses. It’s inaccessible for me. I also know an ECG can be done at almost any hospital around here, it’s not a specialised test.
Thank you so much. It absolutely sucks that things like this happen and I’m sorry you were in such an awful situation. I’m the same with not being able to drive past the building. Unfortunately as I’m in Wales I don’t have ‘right to choose’ so I have any right to swap my cars to another place without extremely good reason. I just really hope PALS helps me in advocating that my mental health condition is good reason.
Personally, I don't believe that comparison works well - coming from both a physically disabled person, and as someone who worked in accessibility for a number of years. Whether we like it or not, the organisation is placed in power over the individual in these situations, therefore it's less about the principle and more about what they will accept as an argument.

That is why I would advise to avoid the comparison, as the easy retort is ""This isn't a physical accessibility issue"" because it isn't, and that can stop the discussion there and then.

What you have outlined above about danger is way more in line with what they may accept. They are unlikely to accept the building being the issue - as the issue is the building may add to a certain response, the response is what is denying access.

I don't know what they may argue back, but they'd probably say that the support of mental health professionals constitutes a reasonable adjustment. Regardless, I stand by my point that I don't think comparison to physical impairment is helpful - and in the eyes of the law, it's not about the nature of the impairment, it's about what the organisation deem ""reasonable"" and that does change based on accessibility needs.
If you don't get anywhere with the cardiologists, it might help to talk to your mental health team about the issue, since they seem to be very involved in your care. (I didn't want to assume - from my understanding it can be very difficult to get mental health care with the NHS.) They are going to be infinitely more informed about your challenges and what has and has not worked for you in the past than me, an internet stranger.

p0193,recent,mh_wp,People believe depression is disabling until you actually show signs of being disabled,202,disability,"Society is victim to capitalist propaganda. We've been conditioned to equate human value with ability to work. With making money. If you aren't doing those things, people perceive you as a deadweight, a mooch, a leach, a parasite, etc. But there's a huge difference between sitting around doing nothing because you simply don't want to work or contribute and not working because of a legitimate reason. I honestly think people get jealous. That they want a break from their daily grind, and that's why they're so eager to accuse disabled people of not trying hard enough or ""faking"" it. Oh, the irony, right? Jealous of this??? They truly don't know how much we suffer if they feel jealous of us. Their feelings are so misdirected though. What they should be doing is getting mad at their employers for exploiting them and unionizing the workplace if possible. They wouldn't feel so jealous if they actually had decent work hours, decent vacation times, PTO, paid sick days, and actually good benefits.
I try to not care when others say things like this to me. But it’s so hard. Where I grew up many people didn’t believe in mental illness (Bible Belt of America).I feel terrible when I am unable to do anything I feel like I’m supposed to constantly be doing things but I can’t. 
When I got approved for disability I felt so validated and seen. I thought I’d be trying to get approved for years fighting because I have mental illness. I have BPD, MDD, ADHD, NSSIB, EDNOS, GAD, CPTSD IBS and “marijuana abuse”. People think I’m lazy but my body is in constant pain, I take 4 daily medications, have side effects, extremely poor memory, can’t focus on anything I dissociate all of the time, just took a shower yesterday in I don’t know how long and I’ve lost 20lb in 2 months. I want to do things but I can’t, why do people think we want this? It is miserable. I wish I could just do things, I’ve lost my life to mental illness. I’ve missed spring and summer because I can’t make myself do anything. I wish I could enjoy my life but that’s never happened. I wish I could’ve gone to the beach this summer, smell the flowers in spring, i wanted to swim and go on hikes. I want to be outside for autumn but instead I wake up crying and have the energy for nothing, I sleep because it keeps me safe from myself. I’ve lost my only friend because they don’t understand and would compare their physical illness to my mental illness. 
I try to tell myself “who cares what others think” but it’s so hurtful to be judged by my mental illness and lack of ability to take care of myself. I can’t do my ADL’s and I just wish they would have sympathy. When I get bad and reach out for help, I get lectured and yelled at by people who are supposed to love and care about me. 
Mental illness is illness and I will never stop advocating for us. No matter how many people judge/dislike me. Everyone deserves access to have a roof over their heads, everyone deserves accessible mental health care. It’s not our fault, we did not choose this.
Substitute severe anxiety for me, which leads to depression because of inaction. I feel so seen. I toiled and hated it for 30 years. I can't seem to do it anymore. I've never heard that term bedrotting, but I feel like this is what I'm doing. My bed is my safety zone. I'm so poor, but I live with a friend who understands. I try to do Gigwork, but I feel so scared to go ""out there."" It's avoidance of discomfort to the point of great fear. I failed again yesterday. This is probably one of the worst developed countries to have mental health issues in. This is a pull-up- your-bootstraps kinda country. Hard work!! Make money!! Don't be ""lazy!!"" Do whatever it takes to get ahead and be successful or die!! I hate being like this. I have lots of help and meds, but there is no magic bullet to fix my mind. I am put off by the oversimulation of the work day, business hours, The Rat Race, Hustle and Bustle, etc. Something happened to me over time. This society seems to have very little tolerance for debilitating mental health. It's only helped by SSI or SSDI, which people can barely survive off of without help from loved ones and friends. That's only IF you win Disability. I hate being like this, but I HAVE contributed to society and want to live a good rest of my life. I'm 55. Fear keeps me at home, and that depresses me. I didn't used to be like this, but I've had massive, traumatic life changes over the last 20 years.
Sorry if it's too personal, but were you diagnosed with a mental health condition and then also diagnosed with CFS?

I have a mental condition and I realize it (and the medication) can make a person tired, but sometimes I can hardly function. My mother was also diagnosed with CFS, but I never took it seriously until now.
Yup, I've gone two months a few times without showering and doing quite well if I can make it once a week. I have schizophrenia and the negative symptoms can look a lot like severe depression and are worsened by meds. Avolition, alogia and anhedonia are big ones. My life isn't something to be envied when I live in poverty and can't manage to clean myself or my house and rarely even get any enjoyment from video games or my old hobbies and don't have the concentration for a movie.

You could write a list to hand over during the appointment, send an e-mail in advance, give a PowerPoint presentation, make a diagram.


The first session will start with your therapist going over their terms of service, and making sure you understand their duty of care/mandatory reporter responsibilities, and consent to be their client.


Then they'll ask why you're seeing them, and that's when you give the rundown of all the stuff going on with you.


It might help you to prepare a timeline in advance that you can refer to. (When various conditions/symptoms became obvious to you, when you received diagnoses, key periods of abuse or traumatic events, etc.)


I honestly don't know what role your therapist could play in ""helping with my disability and struggles with the medical system"". What do you mean by that?


They can help you find and trial strategies to protect your mental health, build resilience, and get stuff done. They can help you process trauma and heal, help you learn how to build healthy relationships etc. 


They probably can't help you with paperwork unrelated to therapy or navigating the system, advise your decisions or advocate for you. 


But they can help you work out what decision you want to make, and some therapists do have lived experience navigating these systems and can tell you what worked for them.
I apologize if this is untoward, but I do not understand this question.

Of course we can tell our providers that we are disabled! A mental health therapist is not necessarily going to be aware of the physical health conditions. In my experience, it has only been therapists who are in a clinic in the same hospital system as my physical health doctors who have access to my diagnoses and medications. Every other therapist, I have had to tell them about my diagnoses and medications. Even when the therapist is with the hospital system, I generally need to spell out what my diagnoses mean because even most medical providers are not familiar with what I have and even then, they are not familiar with what I experience day-to-day unless I tell them.

And thank you for helping me feel validated and less like a fraud. I’m on disability for multiple mental health reasons and sometimes o feel like my family, friends, and doctors look down on me for it but my therapist has been helping me combat that. Mental health issues can be debilitating and dangerous, I’m glad it’s a valid reason for disability even if it’s a hard battle to be approved.
I’m on disability for mental health reasons (panic disorder with agoraphobia). I just wanted to thank you for posting this. Mental health struggles are no less valid or debilitating. It makes me feel a bit less depressed to know that others (like yourself) understand.
Right! Like, I'm disabled for mental health reasons (ive been on it since i was 8) and its not like i just get a little sad and anxious sometimes. i have severe breakdowns when im under any sort of stress to the point that i could not work a full time job, even though i really wish i could!
I hate you Had To go Through with that. Just tired of ignorant Ableist people sometimes 

Yeah Your Reasons For being on Disability is Valid 

Just Made me Also think about my personal experience with people like that 

Like it makes me Very Sad that Some people don't understand 

How Much Non Visible as well as Visible Disabilities effects people 

Well for me I have Severe Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder 

And bipolar disorder and unspecified PTSD, And recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability 

Just get tired Of The Abled body making disability like the Olympics 

Like people have to compete with each other to see if they Disabilities are severe enough for disability 

Which true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function 

Which this does 

Which I have Agoraphobia I'm the opposite I can't Be Around people 

I can't even go to the Hospital without having a panic attack 

like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent 

Because I still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function 

Only time I leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult 

But I live alone don't really have support 

Since I look so Normal and functional unfortunately 

Plus people think because I'm a black man I'm immune to being disabled or having a disability 

Just kinda hard Because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community 

It effects me daily 

It's detrimental on my economic status 

It's hard to just text and talk on the phone 

Even right now I'm getting a headache 

But it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability 

Try to explain to ignorant people that are Ableist like you dealt with 

I'm quite the opposite I can't stay with people I would have a panic attack unfortunately 

It's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis 

Like they force you to share rooms which aggravates my disabilities.

And aggravates my anxiety PTSD symptoms as well 

Just everyones disability effects people differently 

Mines kinda severe to me 

Like Hate the Competition Thing abled body people created 

Sound like people have to compete with each other like freaking capitalism 

Just for Disability payments 

I hate that 

I wouldn't apply for disability if I didn't need it 

I felt so much guilt younger

People saying my disability is not severe because they can't see it 

Or people always assume you faking it 

Since mental illness they quote you can fake 

Which makes me very upset 

Because they will never know how I feel in my body and mind 

If only that knew they wouldn't be saying that 

And by the way Disability payments can't even cover Rent payments 

A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is over 1500$ for the worst area 

So probably pushing 2000$+ for a good area

Just make me upset and triggered 

Because I have no reason to make up how my disability effects my life daily 

People are so ignorant with mental illness 

They assume because I'm laughing at a movie 

Or taking a selfie 

I'm faking a mental illness 

Which makes me upset 

Like My therapist tells me to watch television using coping mechanisms to distract 

Like they don't know people with disabilities don't always have bad days 

Have a bunch of bad days 

Which I do but 

I like doing the coping mechanisms my therapist taught me 

Just make me cry a little 

Because Disabilities people can't understand what they can't see

Not trying to get emotional 

Just your post resonated with my life 

Bought up bad memories I guess 

Like people think because I workout 

Which is at home by the way 

I can't handle public commercial gyms by the way 

But people assume because I'm trying to use a coping mechanism 

To cope with my disability 

That means I'm faking it 

Or using reddit as a journal like now 

Which I'm anxious as well typing this 

Just people don't understand disabilities effect people differently 

Just Ableism in society 

Might not be to abled body person that has no problems leaving their house 

Or a person that doesn't feel like a lion is being chased after him for just talking or talking on a phone 

Like I live alone but my with my disability I couldn't live with people that would make my condition worse 

I had anxiety just living with family members 

Just because I live alone people think my mental health is not severe 

That really makes me upset 

Because Disabilities effects people differently 

Mines just as severe or life altering as anyone else 

Just because I live alone doesn't mean I'm independent 

I still can't keep a job and stuff 

I don't think being independent is until I can live a functioning life 

And people that have jobs still have disabilities 

Disability effects everyone differently 

I hate this grade scale stuff 

That Ableist people use to say you not deserving of help

Just Ableism sigh

Which I tell distant family and Ableist strangers on social media sites 

I don't have to live in a group home unfortunately 

Because my anxiety would get worse and turn to a crisis 

Just I really relate to your post op 

I guess I got triggered by you quoting Ableist people that said that to you 


But hate people feel like mental illness is not taking seriously 

Which I'm not physically disabled which I definitely respect and understand 

But speaking from a Ableist person perspective 

Like they think people with mental illness or other invisible disabilities 

Should not be considered for disability 

And they always say we lazy or faking because we lazy 

Which I would love to keep a stable job 

But capitalism doesn't value that capitalism values efficiency and profit 

And doesn't value disabled people fitting in 

Not trying to rant on capitalism because I know everyone opinions is different 

I would love to work it's just hard with my conditions

Because due to Ableism they really think People getting disability checks 

That doesn't even cover a full month of rent 

Is a luxury.

Which the Lowest paying minimum wage job pays more than disability pays people.

Like This effected me for a long time 

My whole life 

Just because it gets me emotional knowing because you don't see me walking in a cane or wheelchair 

Or a Down Syndrome or something more visible 

Like I don't have those conditions I'm still disabled as them 

Autism you can't see, learning disabilities you can't see

Even some physical illnesses are invisible 

Such as Sickle Cell and Lupus 

Everything is not visible like blindness 

But my mental illness effects my life as much as any other disability effects people lives in society 

Just because I have muscle or tall black and 6'2""

Keep myself groomed 

I guess I have to look unhoused to For people to understand how my disability effects me seriously 

It's so flawed 

Invisible Disabilities doesn't work like that unfortunately 

I'm deserving of disability as much as anyone that has a disability 

Sorry for the rant OP

It depends on the disabilities the couple has and their severities. You obviously love and care for your partner, that doesn't mean it's healthy. The original info you gave sounded of desperation, this now sounds more like it's all financial, rather than disability related.

I suggested couples therapy in my previous response. Are either or both of you getting therapy individually for your mental health / physical issues? On medications? Have family or friends that can help?

I actively participated in growing up with both of my parents dealing with mental issues struggle through love, hatred, abuse, marriage and divorce, depression, grief, manipulation, neglect, bargaining, drug use, alcoholism, resentment, anxiety, animosity and progressively deteriorating health for nearly 40 years before cutting almost all contact with them both. They were soulmates and life partners too.

Now I struggle dealing with the aftermath after 53 years of being emotionally, mentally and physically abused. My wife has childhood trauma of her own, but no physical impairments. We make it work, but just barely. I am on 100% disability and do bi-weekly psychological therapy. I am in to see my specialists once a month for my physical issues.

We have gone through couples therapy multiple times and barely managed to avoid divorce twice in just over 23 years of being together and married for 16. If it wasn't for being lucky and getting approved for full disability we wouldn't have made it past our fifth year of marriage no matter how much we love and care for each other. It's just too much. 

Any of this sound familiar? I would like nothing more than for things to work out for you and wish you luck. I really do. But it's a crapshoot and two emotionally or mentally broken people rarely stay together in the end. The truth is the percentage is high that it will fail, but I would rather be honest with you than blow smoke up your ass or try and convince you that everything is unicorns and rainbows.
Honestly, none of that sounds familiar. We don't take it out on each other, we don't fight or use drugs to cope, we don't hurt each other. We also are a gay couple who doesn't want kids. So we aren't abusing or neglecting any kids. 

It's all connected, disability, financial, mental health. Because of disability and mental health, he's been having to take more time off work. Now my physical and mental health is getting so bad I have to take time off work. Our mental health is getting even worse due to financial stress and our failing bodies, 

I'm desperate to find a way for both of us to get the care we need and stay together, as well as be able to afford things like rent and groceries. 

As for your questions, we are doing our best. I have a therapy appointment next week (but I've been struggling to get that set up due to my therapist not having availability, so I'm about a month behind),  I've got a doctor's appointment to go over the migraine I've been having in 2 weeks, and an mri next month.

Eating disorders are mental illnesses and they can lead to physical illnesses but I would not equate having anorexia to having Multiple Sclerosis. Feels like comparing apples to oranges in my opinion.
But I wouldn’t be so concerned what others consider a disability as in a lot of ways that’s subjective, what might be disabling for me might not really bother you. 

Reading this breaks my heart though , I’m praying that you’re in mental health care on a regular basis and that you have encouraging and supportive people around you. Focus on healing your mind so your body may follow.
Yeah, but applications for those things require way more than actually having a disability, you have to prove that it's disabling to the level that you cannot cater for a lot of things. Some mental illnesses can be classified as such, but most are not. Nonetheless, many discussions are addressing mental illnesses as disabilities.

The boundary you are trying to set between mental/physical is a bit hard as well, depression can impair your physical abilities, but it is pretty much on a cognitive level. EDs can make you physically weak/sick, but it is also pretty much about treating your mental condition.

With that said there are a few exercises I was curious about given I can't see videos and demonstrations.  If you were to explain to someone blind what is or how to do the skull crusher exercise how would you describe it?  Thanks in advance, hear this exercise is great.
For allthe people that talked about the fact that weight lifting is not recommanded for people with a glaucoma :

  
First of all yes, you should always ask your ophtalmologist before starting any new program/sport

  
I did that with two differents doctors and both told me that the small increase in the IOP due to the weight lifting/exersise wasn't something dangerous, that you can lift weight  without any issue but you should just try to avoid exersises where  you are on your head, so basically just the handstand push up in our case
Weight lifting alone could get boring, I speak from my experience. The best, in my opinion is to lift then use it in an active sport or marshal art. Every week you’ll feel stronger and more capable. For me, I lift 1 or 2 times a week and train BJJ twice a week. And do blind hockey on a biweekly basis on the weekends. I speak from my experience,  everyone is different.
Hey, I also have glaucoma and am quite into fitness.

I tried lifting weights for a while too, but i found it kind of boring. It is nice to get into, but it eventually gets boring when you realize the only thing you can do is put on more weights. Maybe that floats your boat, but I personally didn't find it fulfilling enough.

  
I started calisthenics though, and I have found so much more motivation to do my workouts. It feels so much more satisfying to learn how to do a skill like L-sit from the ground, toes to bar, pistol squat and pseudo planche pushup. Those are just kind of beginner moves, I want to progress into the even more cool ones. You do need a bar though, preferably one for pullups/hanging.

As for the people saying it is dangerous to do lifts due to spikes in IOP. I think there is definitely merit. I think the best way to keep yourself safer in that context is to never over-strain yourself (close your eyes tightly because it is too hard), always maintain your breathing, and of course never do handstands. That is the one thing that I really wish I could do is handstands, because the handstand pushups and presses are so cool.

p0221,recent,mh_pa,Handling Mean Comments About My Disability,48,Blind,"Aw you are really going through it.  Some crappy people are doing a very good job of making you feel like a laughingstock, which by the way you are not.  I know the school has responsibilities to encourage you to be independent, but they don't seem to have the full picture.  

I was resistant to starting to use a mobility cane myself, I was already anxious being in public and the cane made that feeling worse.  Like you, I've walked into things and smacked my head into immovable objects.  That ghot me thinking about the kinds of risks I now face in terms of personal injuries.  This became a more pressing concern after I hurt my shoulder walking into a bike I didn't know was there.    If I keep hitting my head, there's the possibility I could break my nose.  I personally like my nose the way it is, so I started making changes that dropped the opportunity for injuries.  Mishaps I was having one out of every ten times I did something, I worked to drop that to one out of every hundred times, or once every thousand times.  If I'm walking at speed and miss a curb, that can result in dental damage I'm similarly not interested in experiencing, same as with breaking my nose.  

Like I said, you're dealing with a huge amount of concerns and fears.  You're a teen, you're dealing with decreasing sight, and those are two scary things imo.  Has your school already opened a conversation of ways to accommodate your situation?  They will be concerned about students who have been left to fend for themselves the way you kind of are describing, they will be concerned if you are injured on their property and it's later revealed they dropped the ball and did not intervene with proven resources to help you.  

It's really great how you described the way you feel and what your experiences are.  That is a really good skill.  You raise a lot of really good points; maybe consider showing or sharing this post with one of your parental figures as a starting point?  It sounds like you underwent a lot of sight loss in a relatively short time; having gone through less sight loss than you, I found my brainpower took a big hit because all the formerly visual pathways needed to reroute the circuitry for the change in conditions.  If your school has learning support services, I would expect this is something they are trained to work with.

The people who are mean and enjoy punching down on others, they are a vocal minority, do your best to tune them out, they are really unimportant.  You will meet plenty of people who are impressed with your strength and resilience.  You also may grab the attention of the adult version of the folks who like punching down on others; let your expeirences with them in school help further temper your risk assessment.
1) You need to confront the people responsible head-on. I was bullied in grade school (for something other than blindness). I finally “snapped” one day and shouted “Stop it!  You think it’s cool to pick on me because I can’t defend myself?!”  I said it LOUD. Everyone in the cafeteria stopped talking and looked over. It definitely got the teachers’ attention and they had to acknowledge there was a problem. 
2) Report the issue to the teachers and staff. Part of their job is to keep you safe. 
3) Work on building your confidence and poise. If your body language screams “victim” you will be victimized. If you can, participate in a sport or marshal arts. It will improve the way you carry yourself and balance.",aw really going crappy people good job making feel like laughingstock way know school responsibility encourage independent dont seem full picture resistant starting use mobility cane already anxious public cane made feeling worse like ive walked thing smacked head immovable object ghot thinking kind risk face term personal injury became pressing concern hurt shoulder walking bike didnt know keep hitting head there possibility could break nose personally like nose way started making change dropped opportunity injury mishap one every ten time something worked drop one every hundred time every thousand time im walking speed miss curb result dental damage im similarly interested experiencing breaking nose like said youre dealing huge amount concern fear youre teen youre dealing decreasing sight two scary thing imo school already opened conversation way accommodate situation concerned student left fend way kind describing concerned injured property later revealed dropped ball intervene proven resource help really great described way feel experience really good skill raise lot really good point maybe consider showing sharing post one parental figure starting point sound like underwent lot sight loss relatively short time gone less sight loss found brainpower took big hit formerly visual pathway needed reroute circuitry change condition school learning support service would expect something trained work people mean enjoy punching others vocal minority best tune really unimportant meet plenty people impressed strength resilience also may grab attention adult version folk like punching others let expeirences school help temper risk assessment need confront people responsible headon bullied grade school something blindness finally snapped one day shouted stop think cool pick cant defend said loud everyone cafeteria stopped talking looked definitely got teacher attention acknowledge problem report issue teacher staff part job keep safe work building confidence poise body language scream victim victimized participate sport marshal art improve way carry balance,positive,0.223,0.607,0.17,0.9719,0.08606614917516708,0.5587977766990662,0.35513603687286377,negative

p0223,recent,mh_pa,Anyone move to somewhere for public transit?,30,Blind,"I have RP and so does my cousin. I strictly live in large cities with public transport and would never live anywhere I couldn’t get around myself. I am comfortable with the cane at night when needed. I am very much happy being independent but do rely on others for certain things. 

Conversely, my cousin also has RP and lives in a rural area close to family. He is not happy and often finds himself frustrated by having to rely on others for almost everything. He doesn’t seem as happy and doesn’t know how to use the cane.
I fully moved countries for the public transportation.  Although originally I was interested in the country I'm living in for other reasons, what changed my mind about staying permanently rather than come for short visits was the freedom I found here that I had never experienced before.  

To be fair though, I couldn't say I really *fully* enjoyed living in the US because, y'know, I was never going to be able to live independently.
Following this thread, wondering the same thing as I plan to move soon due to vision loss and want to maintain independence through public transportation 
I also have RP, and post-undergraduate degree have lived multiple places where having public transportation/walkability was one of my top priorities. My position is different than yours, as I was legally blind by 18 and had to make these decisions as a young adult rather than an established adult with working vision, but from my experience, I would absolutely recommend moving somewhere/living somewhere with public transportation that  allows you to be as autonomous as possible. I would never consider moving somewhere where I can’t be independent and navigate, at this point in my life
Paratransit in some progressive cities are getting better when they utilize the micro transit services sometimes offered by third-party, subcontracted programs that are not the clunky short buses they pick you up within a 30 minute window and then you can be on the bus for up to 60 minutes each way. Again, the micro transit would be a city where UZURV or via transportation operates.
This is a deeply personal decision! I am totally blind and have had made every choice about where I live based on public transportation. I live in a big city and bought a condo less than a block walking from the nearest subway stop. For me, paratransit is not really a functional option Because it is so unreliable and can take so long   Also, for what it's worth I find it easier to make friends in big cities because there are just so many people around
Where are these places y’all live with public transportation and walkable places? I’m in the same position and trying to move.
Have you reached out to a local blind organization? Maybe they will have strict strategies in orientation and mobility for navigating your specific area. I cannot promise you strategies will work for you/be affective but they would be the best people to ask. Especially because I bet you are not the only blind person in your area to have that same kind of issue
I live in Massachusetts in a suburb of Boston. There's decent public transportation and Boston is a pretty walkable city. Many of the suburbs have commuter rails and busses, and all public transportation is free for the blind. I also get subsidized $40/day in Uber or Lyft rides, if I need it. This is all through the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. I am very recently legally blind so I haven't actually utilized some of the benefits yet. I just got an electric bike and that's been really helpful. The only setback is that it's a HCOL area.
I also have RP, and grew up in a very rural area. I feel for your cousin, after growing up I immediately moved to areas that are walkable and have public transportation/are more urban, and have a much higher quality of life. Rural living can be challenging for anyone, but from my experience it’s just not feasible for anyone who is blind/low vision.
> Rural living can be challenging for anyone, but from my experience it’s just not feasible for anyone who is blind/low vision.

I am in my 40s and have never been able to drive. Since becoming an adult I have spent half my time in a large suburban town with no public transport and half my time in a small rural town with no public transport. If I had to choose I would say the rural town was better. It was walkable and had bike lanes and sidewalks and people I knew that would give me a lift in the pouring rain. The suburan town had no sidewalks, no bike lanes, and everything was miles apart.

For the first time in my life I have access to public transit and I still want to cry with happiness everytime I can choose to go somewhere and really be independent but it's still a limited service that doesn't give me the same freedom as a large metropolitan transit service.

I too lost a parent. The reason why I say learn to do things non-visually is because I am completely blind, and I have done plenty of sports in my life, as well as dance, and a few other things that you mentioned that you said blind people couldn’t do.   a change of location might do you some good. It will give you a fresh start, and it certainly helped me when I lost my parent at the age of 19. Perhaps take up some thing like cooking or baking? Origami is also very interesting, you can get into LEGO building, all these things are accessible for blind people nowadays. In fact, there’s a whole world of accessible things for blind people nowadays.  You’re never too old to go back to school.   Also, what’s this about having a rich man to support you?

Maybe you can try an AirBNB in a few different cities and see if you like any of them?

I can appreciate that it might feel too hard to leave given how many animals you have, but maypbe you can use that money to hire someone you trust to look after them.

There are also some organizations that do blind events, like my relative who did blind golfing and glind skiing. I myself don’t have the money to go do a specialized trip like this for blind people, but this sort of adventure does exist out there for us.

p0230,recent,mh_pa,What is your mission in life?,6,Blind,"As someone who loves languages, math, and puzzles, I’ve found learning braille to be really rewarding (after a learning curve at the start). I had a bit of vision left and was able to memorize the characters visually very quickly, but it took a while for my fingertips to re-wire. Anyway, I think just having something that I’m gaining, instead of everything that I’m losing or that’s getting harder, has helped lift a bit of depression that had the world and all my goals cast in a shadow.

Braille displays also have their own word processors so I’m hoping that will help me as I edit a novel I wrote.

I get what you’re saying, though. I too have a job that was more interesting to me when I could just sail through it. Now I think about quitting every day. I find it so stressful to use screenreaders on a laptop, but I find voiceover with an Ipad to be ok for somethings. I like how I can use gestures instead of memorizing a million key combinations that you can‘t even perform properly with fingers at home position. (For example, control and the letter “q“ at the same time to exit NVDA, when both of these buttons are used with the left pinkie finger. If only I had two left pinkie fingers, I guess.)

Anyway, a lot of  blind coders use braille to code. I find that braille activates my visual cortex and I sort of see the words I’m reading. Maybe that would be more rewarding for you.

If you are patient and enjoy teaching, you could look into joining an assistive tech service (probably state occupational services) for the blind. Then you’d have motivation to learn the tools since you’d be teaching them to others. As I’ve met more and more older blind people, I find that there are many who haven’t gotten very far with learning to use phones or computers and could really get some functionality back just learning and practicing the basics like emailing and texting and being able to chagne the speaking rate and turn the screen reader off and on. I enjoy teaching an older friend how to use voiceover on her phone, but it does take a lot of patience and repetition. 

I love exercise and I’m looking to get a guide dog that the trainer has agreed to teach to run. It‘s a small company though, and they might not have all the dogs for the demand. 

I do a bit of running independently with a white cane and high-mileage roller ball tip. I also am getting back into practicing soccer with a bell-ball. Exercise does help with the dark haze of depression that I”m always fighting off. It doesn’t quite lift it enough for me to want to try hard at work though. Maybe I just need another job for that.
Keep your options open for OSes. Having both Windows and Mac machines, or a dual-boot Mac is a good choice. Some time ago my work machine was a dual-boot MacBook since I was developing for Windows and for Mac at the same job.

For writing, consider using a dictation app and then having the recording converted to text. I'm sighted, but I use speech to text regularly, especially when I'm walking or driving a familiar route. 

For OS control there's a new app called Cephable you might want to check out. Just a week and a half I attended a conference where Cephable presented, and it looks like the software could fill in the gaps not address by JAWS and NVDA. During a short chat with the founder I asked if the software could be adapted to find and dismiss modal dialogs, and he said it could, though it's unclear to me whether that would entail additional work. In the presentation he mostly emphasized accessibility for people with limited mobility. At some point I'll create a post about it.

Sadly the dog got older and I got a lung disease. It got to the point where bending down to pick something up from the ground caused me to need to sit for a while, which was dreadful.
Now I use an exercise bike; I either make a playlist of songs for a set timed workout, or my book player can pause between chapters, so I look at the timings of those and tend to go time over distance. Sometimes I will use my Fitbit when cycling to compete with my family, particularly if my daughter’s doing some other sort of sporting activity.

I play tennis once a week, swim when I can, walk the dogs, and that’s about it really. I have no desire to be overly buff and nobody to buddy with at a gym anyway, so I just have to take things as they are. I average about 10,000 steps a day, although on a quiet workday that’ll be 4,000 and during a cycling session it might hit 12,500 or something. I also tend to pace about a lot to think or when I’m on a phone call or meeting where I don’t need to type; I’ve done at least a mile just going round and round my garden.
There’s usually tons of camps for blind kids in the summer. I wish tgere were more for adults haha. 

I try to walk and do my physical therapy exercises but I’m pretty cooped up and sedentary myself.
I mostly work out at home with a Nintendo Switch game called Ring Fit Adventure, which I started using before I went blind. It is a fantastic fitness game with a wide range of workout options, and I loved it until my vision loss started.

However, its visual accessibility is on par with your average video game produced in 2018, so… not great. I can still do it because I learned all the moves with normal vision, but I have a lot of problems with obstacles that I can’t see anymore, and it gets harder and harder as my vision loss continues to progress slowly.

I have been thinking about getting a stationary bike and listening to audiobooks while I cycle.
Primarily weight lifting and walking. I dearly miss cycling (tandem is not an equivalent). 

I've both a home gym and gym membership down the road, but primarily workout at home. Absolutely *love* weight lifting.
As someone else mentioned there are lots of camps and organized things for kids, at least there are here in Michigan, I'd be happy to recommend some specific ones if you happen to here.  

I am visually impaired and my duaghter is blind but we are very active reguardless.    We both run, bike, swim, ski (downhill and cross country), kayak and lots more.  We use a combination of different strategies to make things work for us, its all totally possible.   If anyone wants to talk about specific activities I'd be happy to talk.  

Specifically for workouts / training there is an app called Revision Fitness that was developed specifically for blind users.  It's great.  The person who started is a blind Paralympic athlete so he know his stuff.
Our local blind club is looking to get a swishboard. It’s sort of a mix between ping-pong and air hockey, and there is a blinder in the middle so that sighted people can play with blind people without having to wear a blindfold.

If you live in a big place, you might look into goalball. It’s an indoor soccer-like game made for blind people and all the sighted ones wear blindfolds.

  
I go on long walks every day, and when the path is empty, I run for portions using my white cane. I also have to do a lot of stretch band exercises for a surgery rehab.

In the pool, I often do water jogging with one of those floaty belts that people use in water aerobics. You can get a pretty good workout without moving forward all that quickly. That gives people time to get out of my way. (I don’t do this in lanes, but in the open swim area. If I get an empty lane all to myself, I’ll mix this with regular swimming.)

I’ve been riding a tandem bike, and it’s alright. I also go paddleboarding, but almost always with a sighted person. 

I have lived in one place where there was a group that offered sighted guides for exercise for blind people. I don’t live in the right part of Australia, but there are a few places with organisations dedicated to helping blind people do sport.

Maybe start by looking up if there is swishboard or goalball in your area.
I do have some vision.

I like to ice skate, and I used to go once a week until I broke my arm last year (I'm. A little scared to go again haha). A couple of months ago, I got a tricycle, and it's been really great. There's a bike path along the beach near my house. I got it because you need to go fast on a bike to stay balanced - too fast for me to be able to see. So the trike is really nice because I'm balanced and I can go as fast or slow as I need to. It's so much more fun than walking  I'm thinking of making a vest to let others know I have low vision, since I can't have my cane out obviously haha 

Before I got it, I was also looking into getting a tandem bike. They have places where you can rent them for an our or so! My dad took me to this park in the city, and he rode in the front, steering us, and the only thing I had to worry about was pedalling. It was pretty fun, but those bikes are EXPENSIVE...

I dont know if those options are suitable for you, though. There ARE blind sports, and maybe there are groups in your area! My favourite is goalball. Not sure how exercise-y it is, but I thought I'd put it out there haha.

It can be so hard to find a way to exercise that's accessible as a blind/visually impaired person and fun... good luck, I hope you find something you enjoy!
Outside - I enjoy walking when someone is able to accompany me and lend an arm. 

Inside - I enjoy Yoga and Pilates using videos from YouTube that are descriptive (some instructors are better verbally than others). I also LOVE trampolining, I purchased a Bellicon for in my home (I think that is how you spell it) it has a bar on the front, also you can pay a subscription for videos that I do intermittently. It is amazing how many exercises/stretches you can do just using a trampoline also, it is very versatile. Occasionally I enjoy a skipping rope in the sunshine too.

p0232,recent,mh_pa,I don't understand the concept of dancing.,30,Blind,"I have been a ballet dancer for quite a few years now. When I began dancing, there was an initial period where I did find the concepts of dance movements to be a bit abstract and hard to comprehend as an observer because of my visual impairment. However, the more I danced, the more I was able to appreciate the physical aspects of dance and all of its subtle nuances because I had an easier time relating to it from personal experience that I had gained as a dancer. Dance is a form of communication for me. It's about expressing who I am and how I am feeling emotionally, mentally, and physically. It also improves my physical and mental state of being. I love how it feels! When I started dancing, much of my training was very hands-on, and my teachers did have to show me how to place my body into positions. Verbal descriptions helped me as well, especially because ballet is so structured and has set terminology for each and every step and direction of the head, shoulders and body. Ballet even has terminology for the quality of movements (in other words, how a movement is supposed to be performed in order to convey a certain quality or artistic element). Because ballet is so structured and is based upon foundations that you work up to more advanced movements and steps from, it's easier to comprehend how a step should be performed when you have a basic idea of how your body should move in space based on the style of dance you are doing. As I progressed through my training to more advanced levels, I could listen to my teacher give an exercise combination and be able to perform it without having to be shown because I knew how to move my body and I knew which direction to move. There are unfortunately times when I still struggle as  a visually  impaired dancer, however. Creating a mental map of the environment and  navigating it in a patterned, planned fashion without getting disoriented can be a challenge at times. I don't care though. I still dance. To conclude, dance is often a rather visual art form, so I can certainly see how a non-dancer, or even someone who is just new to dance might have a harder time relating to it. Although dance can be quite visual in nature, if you choose a style of dance based upon who you are as a person and really immerse yourself in its history, movements, steps, evolution, music, and its different styles, you can learn to appreciate it in your own way. For example, I love the sound of pointe shoes as ballet dancers move across the stage or studio floor, I love the smell of the pointe shoes, I love the music, the atmosphere, the perfectly timed, precise movements, the history, and I love being a part of it all. Dance is a very poignant, sensory experience for me, and it's a big part of who I am as a person. I love dance! Sorry for my dancer rant! I'll stop now. I hope this is helpful.
I’m really impressed by the thoughtful series of answers you received to your question, OP.

I do a variety of social/partner dance styles and have dabbled in some solo dances like ballet. For the partner dancing, I love the physical movements in time to the music, but also finding new ways to respond to the music and the movements of my partner. There’s a give-and-take to the inertia and the movements that gives a visceral satisfaction. I also improved my physical fitness significantly when I started dancing regularly. 

One of the styles I love is called contra dancing. It’s a traditional dance form that requires sets of partners arranged in a line. They then perform a dance choreographed by a caller. The dancers perform the dance sequence in each set before progressing on to the next set to repeat the same choreography. One of the reasons that I particularly enjoy this style is what I think of as the puzzle factor. Each dance could be described as a new set of sequences that get you from one end of the room to the other, but there’s a lot of creativity that can be involved in how you get there. There’s also a lot of social fun to be had along the way; community, togetherness, laughing at our mistakes, enjoying friendship.

For ballet, I fell in love with the minute efforts that go in to mastering a dance sequence. Like any art form, it requires a great deal of practice and concentration. I found a completely new understanding of how my body worked through learning to make it do new things.

Thank you for sharing your question.
So I am completely blind, the only types of dancing I enjoy are tap dancing or like clog dancing. My suggestion to you is what if you found described video versions of old musicals and watched those to get an idea of that dancing style since you used to watch musicals live with your mom? 

I know I will never fully understand dancing, I do like the metaphor of music for your eyes. My sister studied dance when she was young so had to sit through a few recitals with no idea what was going on. 

But then again there are several things which I will never understand. I rarely get enjoyment over sports, I will never see paintings, and I only know some about the art of dance. But I once went to a production of the Nutcracker Suite ballet just to listen to the music while my friends enjoyed the dance and music, and did not feel like I only got half the experience.",ballet dancer quite year began dancing initial period find concept dance movement bit abstract hard comprehend observer visual impairment however danced able appreciate physical aspect dance subtle nuance easier time relating personal experience gained dancer dance form communication expressing feeling emotionally mentally physically also improves physical mental state love feel started dancing much training handson teacher show place body position verbal description helped well especially ballet structured set terminology every step direction head shoulder body ballet even terminology quality movement word movement supposed performed order convey certain quality artistic element ballet structured based upon foundation work advanced movement step easier comprehend step performed basic idea body move space based style dance progressed training advanced level could listen teacher give exercise combination able perform without shown knew move body knew direction move unfortunately time still struggle visually impaired dancer however creating mental map environment navigating patterned planned fashion without getting disoriented challenge time dont care though still dance conclude dance often rather visual art form certainly see nondancer even someone new dance might harder time relating although dance quite visual nature choose style dance based upon person really immerse history movement step evolution music different style learn appreciate way example love sound pointe shoe ballet dancer move across stage studio floor love smell pointe shoe love music atmosphere perfectly timed precise movement history love part dance poignant sensory experience big part person love dance sorry dancer rant ill stop hope helpful im really impressed thoughtful series answer received question op variety socialpartner dance style dabbled solo dance like ballet partner dancing love physical movement time music also finding new way respond music movement partner there giveandtake inertia movement give visceral satisfaction also improved physical fitness significantly started dancing regularly one style love called contra dancing traditional dance form requires set partner arranged line perform dance choreographed caller dancer perform dance sequence set progressing next set repeat choreography one reason particularly enjoy style think puzzle factor dance could described new set sequence get one end room there lot creativity involved get there also lot social fun along way community togetherness laughing mistake enjoying friendship ballet fell love minute effort go mastering dance sequence like art form requires great deal practice concentration found completely new understanding body worked learning make new thing thank sharing question completely blind type dancing enjoy tap dancing like clog dancing suggestion found described video version old musical watched get idea dancing style since used watch musical live mom know never fully understand dancing like metaphor music eye sister studied dance young sit recital idea going several thing never understand rarely get enjoyment sport never see painting know art dance went production nutcracker suite ballet listen music friend enjoyed dance music feel like got half experience,positive,0.256,0.697,0.047,0.9989,0.7020888924598694,0.0245987456291914,0.27331238985061646,positive

p0234,recent,mh_pa,My partner is going blind at 30,17,Blind,"Has she had any kind of skills training? She's going to need orientation and mobility, Braille, assistive technology, and other life skills training to be able to function independently.  

If you're in the US, you need to contact your state's department of vocational rehabilitation to see about getting her enrolled in training. There are some immersive training programs that blindfold all participants, and get people functioning without sight pretty quickly. 

Blind people can be parents - I know a blind woman who has raised 4 kids, including one with autism. She does everything that any mother does, except drive. I also know a couple of blind women who raised children as single parents. It's hard - parenting in general is hard, and parenting with a disability is even harder - but it certainly can be done, and done well. If she doesn't have independent living skills though, she's not ready to be a parent. She needs to be able to take care of herself first. 

We also can have educations and careers. I'm 2 semesters away from completing my masters in computer science, and I work as an accessibility test engineer. Blind teachers also exist, and not just in schools for the blind. (Although teachers are quitting right and left at present.) 

Her world definitely doesn't have to shrink down to YouTube videos, but she's going to have to do the work to learn new skills. 

You should be aware that a lot of people who are losing sight show resistance to learning those skills at first. They tend to go through the stages of grief - denial, anger, depression, etc. So if she fights you at first on mobility training, Braille, etc. - that doesn't say anything about her as a person. It's a very common response.
I’m sorry, but as someone who plays video games, saying many are blind accessible is not true.

If you’re saying many might be accessible if you’re visually impaired, I wouldn’t know, but completely blind, no.

There are some that are accessible, on the PS5 there’s the last of us series,  God of war, although that isn’t fully accessible, mortal kombat 1, And one or two more,  I’ve missed.  The Xbox 360 I think it is? The latest one? Has Forza motorsports.  There are some games on steam that are accessible, but the unfortunate reality is tons of games aren’t accessible to us.

Personally, if you’re gonna go for a games console, I’d go for a PS5, it has the best screen reader in my opinion, although I haven’t tried an Xbox but there seems to be a couple more games on the PS5 anyway.",kind skill training shes going need orientation mobility braille assistive technology life skill training able function independently youre u need contact state department vocational rehabilitation see getting enrolled training immersive training program blindfold participant get people functioning without sight pretty quickly blind people parent know blind woman raised kid including one autism everything mother except drive also know couple blind woman raised child single parent hard parenting general hard parenting disability even harder certainly done done well doesnt independent living skill though shes ready parent need able take care first also education career im semester away completing master computer science work accessibility test engineer blind teacher also exist school blind although teacher quitting right left present world definitely doesnt shrink youtube video shes going work learn new skill aware lot people losing sight show resistance learning skill first tend go stage grief denial anger depression etc fight first mobility training braille etc doesnt say anything person common response im sorry someone play video game saying many blind accessible true youre saying many might accessible youre visually impaired wouldnt know completely blind accessible p there last u series god war although isnt fully accessible mortal kombat one two ive missed xbox think latest one forza motorsports game steam accessible unfortunate reality ton game arent accessible u personally youre gonna go game console id go p best screen reader opinion although havent tried xbox seems couple game p anyway,negative,0.106,0.727,0.167,-0.9388,0.07165934145450592,0.5051375031471252,0.42320317029953003,negative

p0236,recent,mh_pa,Life After High School Advice,5,Blind,"Get with his local state agency for the blind or his Lighthouse for the blind and they can help get him the services he needs to become a successful independent visually impaired adult.  Depending on his state, he might have a school for the blind that he can attend where they will teach him independent life, skills, and orientation and mobility skills plus things like reading, braille, and accessible technology for the visually impaired.  If you get a referral from your state agency for the blind, or the Lighthouse for the blind, most of the schools for blind individuals are free.

How good is he at using a computer, a tablet and a phone on his own knowing that he’s fully blind?  For all those devices, the screen, reader, software is free and built-in to the phone in the tablet and for the computer it’s also free and offers a lot of support for visually impaired and blind people.  Getting used to the screen reader on his phone is key because that’ll help him understand and be able to navigate screen readers, and what he would want to do for the future is get very comfortable with using the screen reader on a computer.  I know I mentioned the tablet and I don’t think the tablets too important, but just keep in mind that’s gonna be pretty much the same experience as using the screen reader on his phone so that’s not necessarily important as long as he has a decent phone, that’s he can use.  Just being honest here, but the Google pixel phones on the android side of things, and pretty much all the iPhones on the Apple side of things are super accessible when it comes to accessibility and their screen readers.

The NFB or the national Federation for the blind, will give them a free cane once a year, so you might want to get him signed up for one of those. That way he can learn to use it and become way more independent and be able just to walk outside safely and efficiently, if you so desires,.  Normally your state agency for the blind or the Lighthouse for the blind can assigned a orientation and mobility specialist to teach you how to use a cane, but I do know and rule situations it’s kind of hard to get one of those people out there.  If he manages to attend the school for the blind, which we pretty much all would recommend he does, they would teach him orientation and mobility skills there.

So yes, from afar, those are the two major things you can do for him is just make sure he has a decent, smart phone and he knows how to use it and it’s very proficient at using it and also he has access to a cane that he can use to travel And learn to become more independent one just being able to walk around on his own.  There are a few videos on YouTube, which you can listen to on teaching somebody how to use a white cane to help navigate but again the best thing to do is get them somebody in person to teach him.

I think that’s a good starting point and please let us know if you have any further questions.  Finding work as a visually impaired or blind person is very very very very difficult but it’s doable with a bit of effort.  He should just make sure he’s fully comfortable with using a computer blind

p0237,recent,mh_pa,"Need advice. Struggling with studies, finding work, and life in general. (Also vent/rant)",6,Blind,"I can't help you much with most of your questions, except to wish you well and all the best, and it's a tough slog ahead.

a few things/ tips, might be totally wrong, so take them with a grain of sault.

Don't rely on your vision, use it as an extra pare of hands as it were when necessary, and instead of using read aloud, start using screen readers for both the PC and mobile. The sooner you do this, the better off you will be in the long run, could also give magnifiers a go, should they be of any help with the amount of vision you have.

Unfortunately, whilst screen readers do work with pdfs, and do not necessarily need to be converted to word, the flowcharts and tabular information is often screwed up. Don't rely on what your uni is teaching you, just see the topics they have, and learn them online through edx, khan acadimy and so on.

 The content will still likely be visual, but there are alternates to learning those or try and gain understanding through context/ other books materials.

&#x200B;

Studying offline is always a better idea, there's a slight chance you'll end up making friends there which will help a lot, but again a greater chance of you just ending up alone and ignored.

Expecting accessibility accommodation's from any uni in India is like expecting politicians to be saints, so you have to have work arounds for most things and most expenses are out of pocket for any and all assistive tech/ help that you might need/ require.

They do allow you writers for exams though, people who read the questions to you and will write what you say( don't get me started on how horrifyingly bad and or wrong this can and does go at times), although now they might also allow you to take your exams on a pc with a screen reader and or magnifier.

&#x200B;

When it comes to mobility and going anywhere alone in India,

Forget walking on the roads, it mostly consists of walking about and asking for help from people to get to where you want to go. to be fair the People in Mumbai are lovely, but asking for help of any kind has always been very difficult for me, at least.

Uber and such help a bit with mobility though, as long as you can afford it.

&#x200B;

Organizations in India to help the visually impaired or those going through vision loss do exist, but they are most often than not toxic, very rude and very likely of not much help unless you can politic with the best of them, in which case there might be some hope.

There's NAB (Has different state branches), TTI( in Pune), AICB and so on.

[eyeway.org](https://eyeway.org) is a decent resource for a list of organizations and a number where you can call and take help? from a counselor for the type of questions you have.

Hope this helps.
Hi, hope you are doing well, I have lived in India my entire life, recently moved to Australia, but I can tell you that I shared same sentiments as you while I was there.

  
For context I have ROP and Amblyopia and extreme myopia I don't know if it's as bad as your situation but I pretty much can't see from one eye and have very bad vision in my working eye.  
Now with the issues.  
Colleges in India are absolutely crap when it comes to accessibility and I realised it now after coming to Australia, one semester I spent at college in India 10 years ago was nightmare and I pretty much had to drop out cause I couldn’t understand anything in class I often got bored and left the class cause I couldn’t see the board or projector and teachers never uploaded lecture files on the learning platform, same problem with books as well I didn’t know much about screen readers back then so never used them.  
Just like you I always felt very lonely in India most of my adult life cause most of my existing friends moved out and making friends was really difficult, I couldn’t find any local groups or anything either, I did make an discord server before but that server is now dead but you can join discord server of this sub reddit of which I am a part of as well and it’s a chill place.   
For physical activity since my doctor told me not to lift heavy weights I resorted to walking that too mostly inside my house cause I can’t see much in night time.  
Now about going out and stuff I used UBER and OLA a lot but I know it’s not the most affordable options.  
in recent years right before I moved here I used swiggy for pretty much everything from ordering groceries to send stuff to people’s houses again depends on availability, I used Urban company for getting haircuts etc.  
If you don’t already have UDID get one it’s important.

p0243,recent,mh_pa,Partially blind with unknown cause. Just looking to vent.,30,Blind,"Ooh OP as a mom my heart feels so much for you, I wish I could give you a big long hug. 

This is going to be long and please forgive me if you have been there done that but maybe if I share it will help if not just disregard it 😊

Have you had genetic testing? I assume you have because you are soo frustrated with testing but at the same time in my experience I thought all the tests had been done but at the same time there is more value to having the right people interpret those tests. I’ll share my experience with my son and if you’ve done all this I still think you are valid and I don’t want to give unsolicited advice or disregard your frustration.

But It might help if you have not?

My son has a disease that is so rare they call it an orphan disease. Even though it is genetic it is recessive and there is no family history on his father or my side of the family because it is recessive. It also wasn’t even properly correlated to a gene until one year before my son was tested at 2 so 8 years! Meaning if you had genetic testing more than 8 years ago there may be newly discovered things to test for.

My sons disease causes the retina to “not work” but the retinal imaging shows as you said “immaculate” retinas. 

There is no evidence of any damage or dysfunction in his eyes and the disease actual is more dangerous to his kidneys though they are stable now and also not damaged.

I’m not sayin you have the same thing as him but some of the “best” eye specialists were the most pompous dismissive assholes when he was a baby and I was trying to find out what was goin on.

In fact I knew he was blind when I gave birth to him I just knew even though his eyes “looked” typical.

I stupidly assumed doctors would be interested and yet I was totally lied to and in fact made to feel crazy the first year of his life because there was no “evidence” even his dad didn’t believe me til he wasn’t making eye contact at 6 months and still maintained that “maybe it’s cataracts but he looked at me when he was born” 
My ex was caught up in himself and ego. So no he didn’t look at him or me (the mom who he would have look at the most when born) he even had trouble breastfeeding because of it…because he can’t fuckin see!

I was blamed for this as well ! doctors can be so divorced from their patients experiences.

 He has light perception that is it nothing else he has never seen my face.

However when we did get the genetic results he ended up being recorded into the NIH as being the “first recorded” to have this who is ALSO blind from birth.

Usually it seems in the cases they have studied about this disease, kids are born with normal vision and there is no indication of an issue. It’s degenerative in nature so everyone they have on record before my kid usually starts to have issues with one eye onset anywhere from 5-18 years of age on average and it usually presents in one eye first and the other much much later. So obviously they don’t know shit about it if my son presents totally different.

So real long way of sayin as someone whose gone through the doctors gaslighting me about what “I know” because they can’t or won’t accept how little “they know” about is excruciating. 

I can’t imagine dealin with it from the perspective of being the one with vision issue. 

I am so so sorry. You are not in the wrong to be at your wits end. I hope you know your experience is valid no matter what some jerk who is also a doctor says to you.

I did not mean to scare you by suggesting genetic testing but I also know how different these things can present and my son only got a doctor who is his advocate and listens to me once I had genetic tests done because as you said “must be faking there is no damage”.

So ruling that part out might show a path to understanding and proper care. Once he started seeing doctors at CHOP in Philly I legitimately wanted to go beat the shit out of everyone in my state my son has been seen by who called themselves a fucking doctor. 

The difference in treatment was staggering. 

Perhaps reach out to them? Even though they are a children’s hospital they see adults because of how much research they do on visual impairments. It felt a lot more comfortable to deal with doctors being so open to how much they don’t know about the eye. So the team there would not be the type to say “you are faking” and just dismiss you.

He also had his vision tested in an intensive way you might benefit from. 

Over the course of a week (and now once a year since) he had MRI, cat scans, ultrasounds, macular photographs, retinal imaging, orientation  and mobility aptitude tests where a sort of “safe” obstacle course is traversed by the patient at different times in their day and different light settings,a bunch of other stuff too. 

The results are then all combined and looked at over the course of a month or two after you leave then they speak to you about findings and recommendations. Then you continue to have this stuff monitored. 

There was a woman there who actually had never known it was not typical to have clouded depth perception and had assumed everyone had the same experience until she brought her child in for issues w his eyes. 

It broke my heart to hear how dismissed she had been most of her life when she ever did bring it up with a doctor.

I hope you get the answers and validation and care that you deserve. You sound like you need some piece of mind and care and I hope I can give a little of that to you right now 🤗

It seems like you have really tried to build a good life for yourself regardless of the difficulties but it seems less about lack of vision and more about the stress from the unknown and lack of care from the people who are supposed to care about these things.

I wish you the best and I hope you are more gentle with yourself. It’s really not your fault and yet seems like you’ve been shamed enough by doctors to almost feel as though it is.

That is not ok and you don’t deserve that type of “non” treatment. Wishing you the best of outcomes as you seek answers, and don’t let some jerks who happen to have a medical degree stop you from demanding proper care and an answer to what is happening with your vision.

❤️🤗

> Are there any good voice to text devices I could have available?

There are 2 kinds:

 * Ones with humans involved that tend to cost a lot, but do a great job
 * AI driven ones that are cheap/free and tend to do a better than nothing job.

The AI driven ones change all the time, and some do better than others, you need to try various ones to see which will do the best in your particular situation. They are not 100% accurate. Most of the time, given good voice input, they are reasonably accurate, but they tend to lose out on anything complicated or out of the ""normal"". They also almost never get nuance correctly.  For your application, that might not matter, but you need to try the different ones and see which seems to work best for your situation in your classes. To help it succeed, wear a microphone and use that as the input.

Also, if you haven't seen Apple Fitness+, they do some ASL at the beginning of the class, and have captions. It might give you some inspiration, and teach you some ASL you can use in your classes.

I'm assuming we're both in the UK so the ENT dr prescribed initially.  I must've got referred to the hospital with sudden 'idiopathic' hearing loss and literally the only treatment they have is steroids. (I have a dead left ear and mod/severe loss in the good ear so when that pops off its total silence).

As it's so hard to get an appt in an ENT emergency (I've gone through A&E at one point)  I got the ENT to write to the GP with the prescription so I can just obtain it when it happens and give myself the dose. They can also administer injections straight into the cochlear but I've never had that as I really don't fancy it. All ENT drs assume you can just stroll in and get your appt which is never the case. 

I think they should be treating your losses as sudden hearing loss, an emergency. For your reference my dosage is Prednisolone 5mg : 60mg for 7 days, 40mg for 3 days, 20mg for 3. They've no idea how it works,  it either brings down inflammation or it switches off the immune system in case your body is attacking itself.  Either way, it seems to work and I won't risk it without it. I take it the moment my hearing drops off.
 
With the vaccines the loss hit more or less 30 days after the jab each time so there was a question mark over it till I saw the pattern. The vaccines were designed to fire up the immune system so I think mine got overfired but m not alone, there are many reports on the net of this happening, even down to the 30 days later. Prior to vacvines  it seems to occur when I get a virus, but not always. Next time it happens they want me to go up to ENT as its happening to get an audiogram/ blood test etc but honestly I feel so awful when it does I'm reaching for the steroids straight away. 

Obviously they'd have to weigh up if OK for you to take them if you're on any other medications but I don't see why not. Rather tolerate horrible steroids for a few days than lose a bit more hearing permanently. 

Oof on the mould! I'm not a fan of audiologists in the main from previous experience. I have open fit but even I know with severe  hearing loss you need a closed mould. It sounds like you haven't been helped at all.  I didn't get a hearing aid till my 30s and according to my notes should've had one from 5 years old for my good ear - wasn't told. Its hard to aclimatise later on when you've just got on with it.

pro deaf=disabled

 - It shows a form of internalised ablism and attempt to disassociate, making disabled people ""those folk over there"".
 - As per the medical model (even 'nicer' versions) disabled people lack an ability to do a thing that is statistically normal and normalised. 
 - As per the social model, society still clearly disables deaf people.
 - Most points against deaf=disabled can be critiqued with ""isn't that true for all disabilities?""

anti deaf=disabled

 - Disabled (as per the social model) is about whether your community or society disables. While broader society does disable Deaf people, the community around Deaf people does not. Once given access to community, language and communication - there is no disabling factor. There are also many global templates of what Deaf intetrated societies look like.
 - Its a trait variation that carries ability, sure, but so is ability/aptitude to do various sports or needing glasses and niether of those are considered disabilities. It can (and should be) completely normalised, or given its own cultural space, and therein be not a disability but just something that some people have like haircolour.

Personally - I think you either have to accept deaf as part of disability or use it to critique the ideology of disability completely (with the aim of bringing other disability groups along with us into whatever comes after). Doing just ""I'm deaf not disabled"" is a half-job.

p0259,recent,mh_pa,Help with cultural (?) divide/getting pushy deaf coworker to bugging me to learn sign language,5,deaf,"Well then.

To start off, who decides whether a person is ""normal"" or not? 

https://www.philosophytalk.org/shows/what-normal

This link goes to a more philosophical discussion (uncaptioned, but I read the listening notes). 

""Statistically, normal is the average or median of a set of data.  In a normative sense, norms are the standards by which our behavior is measured, such as morality and reason. ""


Here we can see how normal can be systematic and structural within a society, and how ""normal"" here differs from ""normal"" in Australia. Normal in America is not having healthcare, and normal in Australia is having universal healthcare, for example. 

Deafness as a whole is not the norm. Therefore, irregular or not normal! However, is that our fault? There are usually 2 paths of ""treating"" deafness, because of its inherent irregularity within society. Medical or cultural. This article divvies it up as ""pathological"" or ""cultural"".

https://www.verywellhealth.com/pathological-view-versus-cultural-view-of-deafness-1048594

This immediately makes me, a deaf person feel like I need to be ""fixed"" for a society that is not structured for people like me. I believe this is what one of the points that OP's co-worker was trying to drive home, but their approach was (seemingly) aggressive and harassing. 


Moving on to the term ""Hearing Impaired"". We all know what hearing is. I am more focused on ""Impaired"". Impaired is defined as... 

-""weakened, diminished, or damaged: to rebuild an impaired bridge.""

-""functioning poorly or inadequately: Consumption of alcohol results in an impaired driver.""

-""deficient or incompetent (usually preceded by an adverb or noun):
morally impaired; sports-impaired.)""

https://www.dictionary.com/browse/impaired?s=t

This gives us the idea that we all SHOULD be hearing. This is hugely detrimental because that assumes we all had hearing and lost it. That is not true. This gives an inherent assumption that not having full hearing is ""less than"". I understand that by default, there are limitations for us because of our hearing, because of the entire framework of society is based on hearing people!


Are we ""less than"" people that are automatically normal in society just because they can hear because it was built for them?


Ironically, I can't watch the philosophical video because its not captioned! Thats because majority of viewers are hearing and would not have a problem watching, and I am irregular. Is that my fault?


I think not.

A few things about your post really stand out to me. If you have POTS, it's extremely common to also have some form of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). That usually presents with hypermobility, joint and/or tendon pain, frequent joint dislocations or subluxations, things like that. Only a few types of EDS have been genetically sequenced so getting gene testing isn't necessarily guaranteed to produce an answer for you on that disorder.

And when it comes to you going to the gym and PT but never having it feel ""easier"", have you always experienced this at all ages when it comes to any type of exercise, where it feels like you should be building muscle but you haven't? Have you ever been evaluated by a neurologist? Do you have an abnormal walking gait/do you waddle when you walk? Do you have abnormally large calf muscles? Do you experience scapular winging (where your shoulder blades stick out from your back when you hold your arms straight out in front of you), have had problems in your childhood/teens with getting down to/up from a sitting position on the ground (and especially if you've never been able to get up/down like your peers via essentially doing a squat)? Have you ever gotten blood results back that came with very high liver enzymes or a high bilirubin? There are a few types of Muscular Dystrophy that can basically show no/very mild symptoms until around 20's-40's, especially ones like Limb-Girdle, Becker, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (all forms of Muscular Dystrophy). There are a LOT of subtypes for these specific types of MD, and even people with the same subtype can vary wildly in their symptom onset, disease progression, and severity of symptoms, but these diseases are very rare, so definitely don't freak out if any of this sounds familiar, just be sure to bring it up to your doctor as soon as you can.

I usually don't like to do the whole ""armchair diagnosis"" thing, but I have Limb-Girdle MD type 2i and your post sounds almost exactly like something I would have wrote like 15 years ago lol. Let me know if you have any questions and I hope you find the answers you're looking for ❤
i figure the hypotonia is catching up with me, the neurosurgeon and his PA i spoke to about potential chiari (i have slightly low cerebellar tonsils but apparently whether something counts as CM-1 depends on the diagnostician) & spine problems didn't seem to be a concerned much at all about hypotonia that doesn't seem to have gone away since childhood, PCP is willing to refer me to a neurologist once i get other more pressing stuff out of the way first which i agree with since i'm a full-time student & this stuff isn't as concerning as the gynecological disorder doing things like causing me very severe leg pain, worse than anything the low muscle tons has ever led to

and aaahhh!!!!! i love swimming, that was my fav sport they made me try but i couldn't keep up with my peers & had to drop out for other reasons as well, my school used to have a pool but they shut it down due to lack of finances for upkeep 😔
my OT had to google what hypotonia was (which is funny because it's not really a common thing?) & my last attempt at PT had me leaving in tears because i felt like i wasn't really being understood/taken seriously & that feeling activated the trauma from my child abuse/medical neglect, so yeah that didn't go well

i'm willing to try PT again at some point (hopefully before i lose my medicaid) but i really want a better picture of what's going on at first so i can stop telling people these vague things & ""maybe's"" and maybe also find a PT familiar with what my issues are instead of just any old PT, i might see about it over the summer depending on what happens between now & then since it wouldn't work well with my class schedule right now

i have hard time with coordinating different muscle groups at the same time to properly do some exercises though (potential chiari has been dismissed so maybe undx'd dyspraxia), they had to cue me on stuff up until i was discharged so there was minimal improvement in that area & that's something that gets in the way of doing stuff on my own which is kinda what's necessary for PT, very annoying

i wish my parents got me PT as a kid 😔
i have generalized symptomatic hypermobility but any joint instability has stopped being an issue since i started taking continuous birth control so while i think hEDS (if not gHSD, i was denied for genetic testing but the only genetic form i fit the symptom profile of is pretty rare - clEDS - so unlikely) is a possibility getting that exact dx isn't a priority for me atm, and no, to my knowledge i've never seen a neurologist, though i plan to

i was dedicated to the gym last summer, and i may have been seeing improvement in the context of the gym (i wasn't really keeping track but all i can say now is that after a long break i'm having a much harder time getting started again than i did the first time i started), but specifically what i meant about the ""getting better"" part is less gym performance and more not seeing improvement in being able to do my part-time job or ""ordinary"" life things requiring physical effort (including having good posture and being able to sit at my desk), so i can't really say for sure if i haven't been able to build muscle

as for other stuff:

- i think i waddle but only contextually, like depending on how i'm feeling, most days i don't think i do, according to my first PT session i have some mild gait abnormalities like bilateral trendelenberg, neurosurgeon i recently saw said i had a normal gait & no signs of muscle atrophy
- no clue about the scapular winging (edit: took a look, doesn't seem like it, not when i hold my arms out)
- afaik my calf muscles are normal, i don't know what would qualify as too big but they seem normal to me
- as for getting up, i've always had some level of difficulty/preference for using my hands or the support of something else to give up, i forgot the name for the specific ""sign"" that is getting up in a certain way that indicates some type of weakness, is that what you're referring to? squats in the gym are REALLY hard on me, i know that, & if i deep squat i risk my muscles not letting me go up immediately, i don't think that's what you mean though
- no idea about bilirubin & the only time i think i've had high liver enzymes is when i was in the hospital for an overdose on tylenol, so probably not relevant lmao

hopefully a neurologist will be amenable to looking into the muscle stuff & my nerves being shitty (lifelong paresthesias) but we'll see - i appreciate your input! also yeah, i recently learned CMT-2 was even a thing, let alone there being like 80 of them lmao
I also have congenital hypotonia for me my issues were caused by a connective tissue disorder (Hypermobility spectrum disorder).
i had a pretty bad bout of influenza once but that was so long ago i couldn't say whether or not that was the trigger, i also have generalized joint issues + generalized hypermobility but any pain/other problems related to that have virtually disappeared since taking continuous birth control so seeking evaluation for possible hypermobile EDS (i was denied genetic testing due to lacking certain clinical criteria so monogenic EDS is unlikely i guess) or generalized HSD isn't as high a priority on my list as all the stuff i have that sometimes occurs alongside it (on top of the fact there's no medical professionals around me who know enough about that stuff), for the POTS getting testing for potential SFSN/other nerve problems is something i'd seek out before anything to do with hEDS or gHSD",yeah agree possibly hypotonia kind catching something else underlying healthy sedentary people might temporary pain increased exercise risk injury warming upescalating exercise correctly

Honestly, as someone whose not in a wheelchair 24/7 and occasionally uses a cane for mobility assistance..

Hell I wouldn't meet someone in a park when I was (more) able bodied for a first date unless I already knew them really really well. 

First date out of the blue which is also first time meeting someone in person? I ain't meeting that person in a park. I ain't going on a hike as a first date. 

And hell, if they're doing that much pushback on something as simple and unthreatening as where our first (0date) date is gonna be at, my hackles are raised. I'd begin thinking dating this person was actually a bad idea and seriously consider unmatching and blocking the person. 

So many red flags.
That makes a lot of sense and is more context than just being in a park, thanks for the clarification!

  
I live in a city and often suggest parks as a first date option because it lowers cost, either of us can bail immediately (no waiting for a check from waitstaff) and unless we are going deep into the trails on the bigger parks, they are popular spots often filled with families with children, crafting and language groups, and exercise groups doing stuff like CrossFit and tai chi, so they generally feel safe.

I have grieved with her as her health gets worse, but I’m also very grateful that as I’ve developed my own health issues in the last few years that I’ve had someone in my corner who really gets it. No one understands me like my mum *because* she is a disabled parent. She’s also instilled so much compassion in me, and even before I got sick I was much more aware of accessibility needs and ableism than others my age. I’m so blessed to be able to say that her disability has made me a better person. Your child will likely grieve some of the differences in their childhood when they get older, but that will not be the defining characteristic of their life or their relationship with you. Raise them to be kind, compassionate, and resilient. Raise them to know it’s ok to rest even if the masses insist on the hustle and grind culture. Raise them to adapt and have fun with your disability (nothing like decorating a mobility aid to make it flashy haha).

p0278,recent,mh_pa,Is it.. bad I have a hard time admitting I am disabled?,29,disability,"There's no disability fairy that comes and waves a magic wand and all of a sudden someone is branded ""officially disabled"". For some, yes, there is a defining singular moment. Maybe they became disabled after a traumatic injury, or were disabled at birth. But for a lot of us, we have a gradual decline in health and then have to figure out where we stand and how we feel about it. And it can be a hard thing to wrap our heads around because it's something we have to decide for ourselves.  

Disability is not a dirty word. But society conditions us to believe it is. So yes, it's very normal to have trouble attaching that label to yourself. Everyone becomes disabled eventually, whether it's at age 15 or 85. I didn't feel comfortable calling myself disabled for a year or two after being diagnosed and needing to use mobility aids full-time, even though I'm sure others would have thought of myself as disabled long before then. You're at the beginning of your own journey, and there's a long path ahead. Ultimately it's up to you when on that path you feel comfortable giving yourself a label.
I personally don't think it's bad. I do understand that it can be hard admitting that tho. Have struggled with that a lot myself. I've been dealing with multiple mental health issues since childhood, and after quite a few failed attempts at working, I wound up on disability as an adult. I wasn't happy with it, but I eventually accepted it. Since I have what's considered to be an invisible disability, it hasn't been easy navigating society. After a mild bout of COVID three years ago, we discovered that I have a chronic illness on top of all the mental health issues, and I've had it since my teens. Tbh, this diagnosis came as no surprise. Still, it's been a struggle to accept this. And the chronic illness has been worsening the last several years. It's invisible for the most part now (meaning I don't use any mobility aids), but I may wind up bedbound one day. I've already been getting more housebound as this has worsened. My ability to do day to day stuff has been deteriorating, and it's been so frustrating and scary. I don't want to have this chronic illness or all of these mental health issues. I want to be healthy and able-bodied too. :'(
No! This is absolutely normal and something we all go through and have to come to terms with.

After high school I went into the military because my parents were already paying for my brothers’ college. I didn’t want to be another financial burden and the military was a solution. Few years of service later, I developed knee problems. My fastest two mile in high school was 10:59, not stellar but above average for the most part. After those years of service, knees just worn out, cannot even do 20 minute two miles. And that’s just depends on if I even last the two miles.

And then this past year, I got into a motorcycle accident. Leg was twisted and I was confined to a wheelchair during my initial healing process. Nothing broken, but my tendon was really bad. My knee for that leg is now maltracking and I am stuck with my cane. If I walk without a cane, my leg makes very **very audible popping and cracking noises.** And don’t get me started on the distance I can walk.

I can run, but after a minute of running I basically have to sit. And my running is a shadow of what it used to be. Compared to where I used to be, it has been a slow descent through depression. 

My advice is to get therapy to help navigate your feelings. My coping mechanisms is the gym. I can still go to the gym and machine workouts and do pull ups and dips and other things that don’t involve heavy lifting with my legs. But I suppose what I’m trying to say is you shouldn’t narrow your headspace just because it feels like the world is closing in.

The ones ive kept have listened. Had me do the exercises with them to make sure I have correct form and it didn’t hurt and would listen to what parts of it hurt me or not
Many PTs don't know how to work with hypermobility. Your experience is not uncommon but it shouldn't be standard. Hypermobility is a complex issues because building strength is super important but you need to limit stretching because the movements that feel natural aren't usually within a healthy range. My old PT was constantly telling me to make smaller movements. 

If you can find a PT in your area that is experienced with hypermobility, you are likely to have a better experience, but they are hard to find, I still haven't found one.
I have had similar experiences with physiotherapy, but also some good ones. Physiotherapy with a focus on pain management worked better for me than a focus on mobility. That's because it was almost impossible to do difficult but helpful exercises until I learnt to manage my pain more (although pain and mobility are connected). I also had the experience of being basically told ""stop doing that and move like a normal person"" like it had just never occurred to me to try?! But now its extremely obvious I can't do that. 

I don't understand their comment about range of movement. If you're hyperextending your knees, it sounds like your range of movement is *too much -* it can go the other way. 

General physiotherapists seem uniquely terrible at dealing with hypermobility, although its slowly changing. Don't give up!
Youre not exagerrating, hypermobility sucks. You need to find a PT who specifically knows a lot about hypermobility. Most don't have a clue about it. 


However even with a hypermobility informed PT, you likely will be expected to self-advocate, and the main focus will be exercises. Unfortunately we have to teach ourselves a lot and fight for ourselves


Try your best to figure out what your personal goals are (ex. more support with mobility day-to-day to increase function, self-care, etc, and preserve energy so you can actually do the exercises), and practice asking for help with them, and write questions up ahead of time. Also write down your limitations (ex. can't stand with your knees bent). The more prepared you are the better it goes. It sucks because it's a lot of effort and I wish theyd take more initiative, but they don't, so we have to :(


Good luck!

p0288,recent,mh_pa,[Rant] Endless cycle of getting worse because condition makes it harder to seek care,18,disability,"Exercise with a disability can be so mundane and frustrating. I have a gym membership but I do the lightest weights on every machine and even that’s hard. Are you able to save up to buy resistance bands? They are a much cheaper alternative than weights and honestly more suitable for people with disabilities imo. I also struggle with motivating to workout myself. It can be so demoralizing doing barley any exercise and just being exhausted and knowing you won’t get much stronger. But I try to tell myself it’s better to move your body a little rather than not all. It will further progress our weaknesses being stagnant. I hope you find some good workouts that work for you!
If you'd like to be more active without a gym membership I highly recommend Hybrid Calisthenics. He has a website and a youtube channel. On the site there are very easy variations of every exercise that are comparable to physical therapy. If you can't do a pushup for example there is a guideline for working up to a single pushup with wall pushups, then inclined pushups, etc. No equipment strictly necessary and there are suggestions for low cost set ups if you do want some equipment.

In the end though remember that it's okay to not be where you were before and to not push yourself past your limits to perform to abeled standards. Moving your body is good! But if you can never get to a full pushup or pull up ( I couldn't), doing the easier variations is still worth it to keep your joints healthy. Anything at all is better than nothing. If you're to the point where walking up the stairs or even sitting up from a chair is exercise, that is okay. 

Also second what the other commenter said about resistance bands! I was using the smaller ones and with some youtube walkthroughs you can get a really great workout in a tiny bedroom.

p0291,recent,mh_pa,‘Disabled’,45,disability,"Ayyy I'm also 19 with several disabilities.

My mom is a Gen-xer and she had to come to terms with me being disabled at the same time she realized her herself had been disabled all her life too with three conditions I also have and she never really realized it (like many folks with Autism, Ehlers-Danlos and Narcolepsy, we both kinda thought it was normal until I started having severe sleep issues and pain). 

In a way, I think I struggle more with my own limitations that my mom struggles with them. I try so so hard to do things I know I can't. And she is always the first to remind me that NO ONE can do everything, my limitations are just harder set and more visible than others'. But instead of busting my balls to do things that hurt me, I should spend my time getting really good at the shit I do well and then trade off my skills for the things I can't do.

 Perfect example -- I'm a good cook, but I can't stand in the kitchen long enough to cook AND do dishes (between the hot water and the standing, it drives my POTS crazy). I cook and manage the food budget for me and my two roomies, and they clean up. 

Another example, my boyfriend is a brilliant mathematician and chemist, and he is physically very strong; I am neither. However, he really struggles with executive functioning (we suspect, and are in the diagnostic process, for autism). He was also raised in a *less then supportive* environment and so he is terrified of doing anything that qualifies as ""adulting"". So I help him with job searches and setting up doctors' appointments (and sometimes with writing essays), while he does the laundry and helps me with my homework. And we can both cook, so we often bicker about who is stuck with the dishes :P

Life is already fuckin' hard enough. Fighting your limitations is the human experience TO A POINT, but not to where you put yourself in harm's way. And honestly, I'm doing pretty damn good, in a lot of ways because of the paths my disabilities have led me down; I've learned about medicine to help myself when I'm sick, now I'm studying for the MCAT. I study music because I could never do sports, and it's brought so many great people into my life. Find a balance and people who are willing to trade skillsets with you. That is so much more important than trying to push past ""false limitations"" that ableists think we put on ourselves (and yeah, I hate to say it, but its definitely a form of passive/internalized ableism).

Feel free to reach out if you ever want a buddy your age. I know, at least where I live, disabled folks our age are hard to come by, and that can be pretty isolating.
