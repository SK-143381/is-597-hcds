I like this OOP
A lot of BORU posts the person doubles down and gets more and more deranged. I‚Äôm mildly hopeful that with the legal intervention Rob can get on the straight and narrow. At minimum he appears to be staying away from OOP which is a good sign.
Saw the title and instantly thought went ""good god, not this asshat again."" (The exbf not OOP)

Glad it was a no news is good news kind of update.
OOP should teach classes. At every stage, she immediately defended her actions and protected herself:

"The brutal rape murder case of a female doctor trainee has shaken India and we, Indian women, are scared",3147,Feminism,"Sister, I have no words to comfort you. This is terrifying. I hope this is the start of a new movement for change in India. Our hearts are with you.
Thank you for your explanation and summary, that made it a lot clearer what has happened.

I‚Äôm in Australia and this case is on the news here, but the information is a bit sketchy. 

I saw footage of the hospital being trashed but no one could say *why* they were doing it. Until just now reading your explanation I hadn‚Äôt realised they were trying to destroy a crime scene.

The more I hear about this story, the more horrific it becomes. The worst is knowing that rape culture is so prevalent in India that local government and police are covering up for gang rapists and murderers, it‚Äôs vile.

I don‚Äôt know if foreign governments putting pressure on India‚Äôs government will help, but I emailed my MP at least. 

If you know of an email address for a government official in India who is in charge of investigating corruption in this please post that, or anything you think might help.
Wow, this is by far the most disturbing shit I have read in probably EVER and I am absolutely livid for this woman and for all the women of India. I don‚Äôt know what we in the western world can do, but we‚Äôre behind you on your quest for justice.
Please talk about it as much as possible.Its highly important to create international awareness regarding it as the current laws and government in this country are not doing much. PLEASE TRY TO TALK ABOUT IT ON ANY PLATFORM THAT CAN MAKE IT INTERNATIONALLY VIRAL.
I don't know what to do to help Indian women. I have donated online. I know that many of the anti-feminists come from there on another site about feminism on Quora and it made me think of how hard it must be for feminists there. It would be good to see the candlelight vigil reported by the Guardian."

Yeah, I'm gonna need to see some statistical evidence that a large portion of men are actually doing that. Sounds to me like another misandrist purposefully labelling a giant chunk of the population as bad guys just because ""men bad"" again. Happens all the time.
See for example members clubs. Women's only club Albright is acceptable and a good and positive thing. Men's only club the Garrick is toxic, old fashioned and misogynist and was eventually forced to accept female members after a long running campaign by feminists and the media.

Thanks for the well researched and thought out post! I would very much like to hope 2020 was the greatest peril and the USA dodged it (barely), but we shall see.
The ""Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022"" is absolutely key here.  It's legislation we should never have needed, but due to Republican brand bad faith politics it is now necessary.  It is an Act no one really knows about that saved this nation from a certain manufactured constitutional crisis the Right was building up to.  There will not be much fanfare around it as it works behind the scenes, but those who came up with it and got it in place in a timely manner are absolute heroes.

The only threat at this point is the Supreme Court, who can essentially reimagine any of this...they have given themselves far too much power with recent rulings, and that needs to be addressed VERY soon before being further normalized.  This needs to be our focus for 2024-2028."

Some peeps at head office got alarmed, had a chat to big boss about it - we had a chat later and even he was ""nothing alarming about what you wrote and I appreciate your honesty""

Was the only comment on the intranet page too
We all got a kit kat.

Thank you for sharing Susanna's story. It was a great write-up. Wherever you are, Susanna, I hope you are reunited with your family one day.
Might've been misadventure by Mr Chorhan. He strangled, and she died. He called for money to flee the country (from Changi Point?), but got nothing. This would also explain why Susanna would not answer the phone. She was dead. 

When he was arrested, it would surprise nobody if he denied any involvement. It would mean 9years to hang/life imprisonment. 

Prank call idea is silly. Who would even know Susanna is missing? Worse still, they want to meet up for money. Even scammers know not to COD if there is no product to hand over. 

edit: historical [SGD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXSIUS):[MYR](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXMAUS) rates on Feb 4th 1990 (1st report of missing) was 1.45; $414 was exactly RM600. Malaysian police should've been involved immediately.

Further reading, shows Mr Chorhan had ties in Malaysia. Suanna mentioned preparing the $414 for the Bomoh, and Chorhan acted his crimes in Woodlands and Choa Chu Kang on Malaysians arriving from JB. Mr Chorhan could have easily discarded the corpse in Malaysia, and it would never be identified even if found.

‚Ä¢ Granola bars. If your professors don't have rules naman regarding eating in class, sobrang laking tulong nito especially if you have back to back classes na during lunch time talaga. 

‚Ä¢Just like you don't need new makeup or shoes, you also probably don't need pens and highlighters in every color of the rainbow. They will all dry out before you can even use them.

‚Ä¢ Befriend your classmates. Yes I know madami satin introverted (I am one) but this is so helpful especially in cases na hindi ka na talaga makakapasok dahil sa sakit or emergency. Kailangan mo ng matatanungan ng assignments or kung may upcoming quizzes ba. Although always be mindful din. Magandang may madedependehan pero wag laging dumedepende. 

‚Ä¢ Utilize your university libraries!! Utilize the library within your locality kung meron!! Wag puro cafe. Wag puro study hubs. When you have enough time between classes but not enough time to go back sa dorm or bahay, you can nap or even sleep at the library. And no one will judge you!! Not even the librarians. Bonus yung mahahydrate ka pa kasi afaik most university libraries don't allow any food or drink inside aside from water. 

‚Ä¢ If you're not from the area you're studying in, make sure you have every emergency landline/ mobile number there is. Hari nawa walang mangyaring masama but you'll never know.

‚Ä¢ Your powerpoint slides don't need essays on them. A phrase, a word, or a picture is enough. This is why most students end up just reading the slides rather than presenting kasi nasa slide na lahat ng gusto nilang sabihin.

‚Ä¢ If for example walang wala ka na talagang time magbasa ng assigned readings, try and go to class early and sit with your classmates na nagdidiscuss nung readings. As a social sciences student noon, di talaga maiiwasan yung may materials ka nang hindi mababasa. What I did was I sat next to or near my classmates who have discussions before the class, kahit hindi ko kaclose. Para bang nakikichismis lang. It saved me so many times especially sa mga prof na ang hilig magpasurprise quiz.

‚Ä¢ Google Docs and Microsoft Word have built in citation features. A lot of students forget or simply don't know that they do have this feature where you just fill in the necessary info and with one click of a button, you'll have a reference list na. Will save you a lot of time especially if hindi mo gamay yung citation na required by your prof.
Get a passport while you're still a student. You can use a student ID iirc. Then National ID since you'll probably get it in 2 years more or less. You will have 2 valid IDs by the time you graduate which are helpful for work.

Also, if banks such as BPI, Metrobank, BDO, and etc visit your school and offers free registration, grab the opportunity and register for an account.

If possible, apply to companies before graduation if you want to get a job asap. In my case, I started sending applications around Jan - Feb when my graduation was around June then did interviews around April - May. You can say that you are about to graduate. Just make sure you don't fail in any subjects at makakagraduate ka talaga.

Lastly, I suggest investing on a good formal outfit that you can use for presentations, defense, intervews, etc. I recommend a black blazer since its what is usually used in research defense and profs will judge based on your outfits as well. Madalas ito nakakalimutan and you don't want to buy this last minute since formal outfits can get pricy.
- Do voluntary internships. Di mo na magiging problema 'yung ""fresh grad with 3 years experience"" (for the most part). Gives you an edge compared to others in the job market, makes your CV look good, tapos kumikita ka pa. Don't do unpaid ones because they're never worth it unless super laking company or dream company mo. Kahit hindi ka business or econ major, you can absolutely do this.


- Join orgs. Org experience gets you internships, and internships get you job offers. Make sure the org position is worth it. If your university has an org with a good network, join that one.


- Network. Make connections with your schoolmates. They are going to be professionals in the future, so are you. College is not just about the degree, but also the network.


- Learn a new language. Multilingual people get paid very well.


- Upskill. May free time ka? Do online courses na may certification. Pwede mo ilagay sa CV mo 'yan.


- Create a LinkedIn account!!! I interned in the HR dept of a company in BGC last year, and part ng screening namin ay 'yung pagcheck ng Linkedin. I think good impression if may LinkedIn presence ka kasi it shows na you at least know how the corpo world works. Also, pad your CV. Saglit lang ako sa internship na 'yun, pero narealize ko talaga na sobrang dami ang di marunong gumawa ng CV. Make yourself marketable!!! And improvemon your soft skills!

I saw this on the PBS news hour here in the US. Absolutely horrible. I'm so sorry for her and all those who care about her. I hope she is able to receive justice.
I have to admit the second I read it this morning I felt so much fear and shock as a woman. And then when I read it happened in India I am so upset to say I was not shocked based on the news I've heard coming from there and worse, I was even relieved that it wasn't anywhere near me. I felt so thankful that I will never have to live or visit India. Indian women deserve so much better. I am so sorry. Your government is failing you. Your men are failing you. We all know if she were a man exposing corruption she would've just been murdered, not tortured and raped before being murdered.
This is so upsetting to me. I also saw the video of the woman who was nearly beat to death in a public area because she told a man she didn‚Äôt like what he was doing and the public there defend it in the comments because she ‚Äúverbally abused‚Äù a man‚Ä¶ the ideology of the men in India is so freaking disgusting.

I had the displeasure of arguing with one on Reddit not too long ago. He was trying to convince me it was Indian men not women who were oppressed in their country. Because the men are ‚Äúverbally abused‚Äù, ‚Äúfalsely imprisoned for rape‚Äù, ‚Äúfinancially abused‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse reporting of rape and abuse is high‚Äù because women ‚Äúuse it as a weapon‚Äù. It was a very disquieting and unnerving experience. He would not leave me alone either. Took it to DM‚Äôs when I told him to leave me alone (conversation was going nowhere). 

This was just one man from your country. One example. Then hearing things like this happening, and thinking about how you live in a country with men filled with that kind of I‚Äôm justified in being abusive because I‚Äôm the actual victim (how dare a woman speak up, right?) kind of mentality. I fear for the women in your country so much.

It also seems like you are in the midst of great change in your country regarding women‚Äôs rights. I fear some of the men are only going to get worse because they feel threatened. I am praying for all the women in your country right now.

Edit: for anyone interested here is the thread it is kind of a unique insight into the mindset of what seems to be a lot of the men in India and how they seem to have a vicitm mentality. How they sweep under the rug womens issues because men are so oppresed in that country apparently. Forgive how b***** I was in the thread. I got pretty irritated and astounded by this person. https://www.reddit.com/r/memesopdidnotlike/comments/1cx50r0/comment/l50fynj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
This case disturbs me to my core. I don‚Äôt know what to do to help but to leave my thoughts here and hope my comment starts a larger discussion. Women everywhere are connected unfortunately by the violence we all experience regardless of country or creed. This case is especially vile and my heart hurts for this woman‚Äôs pain and the pain of all women in that area dealing with the aftermath. As well as her family and loved ones. Women deserve to be safe and not hunted like prey by our fellow man. Change needs to happen not just in India but worldwide."

I am so sorry about the brutality that she had suffered and that officials are trying to cover it up. 

There are real monsters out there, and it's ghastly that they don't want them off the streets. 

May justice be served, and may the people have their voice. 

You have my support, women of India. I don't know how it helps, but my heart goes out to you all.
Every hour there's a ghastly gang rape making the news.

So tge real number is unimaginable for someone who's not an Indian woman.
I'm in my last year of high school, I actually chose this topic (India's view on r\*pe from the perspectives of men and women, how it affects the health industry, recent protests, and what it will take to change things) to write my journalism piece about. People need to know what's going on, and understand how terrible it is and how necessary it is to fix/change this. It's time to listen to women. 

I am so sorry for what you and pretty much every other woman and girl in India is going through. I'm not religious but I don't know how else to put this: I pray it gets better soon, that you will no longer have to deal with this horror story that is often your lives as women in India.

Therapy isn't gendered, what the fuck lol This is some ""only women have feelings"" type bullshit. This is what happens when we don't raise boys to be emotionally aware of themselves and others like girls are. Even CBT would be immensely helpful for most men who have no idea what they are feeling or what those feelings look or feel like in their bodies. Having a good workout routine can definitely improve your mental health, but the gym =/= therapy.

Look after yourself. I hope you feel better.
I've sent you a PM,

Op, You're never alone in this.

Please reach out. :)
*Hi everyone i appreciate all of your comments, i have been crying non-stop from the depression and the overwhelming support. I think i can last until Monday to go to my GP ASAP or go to urgent care tonight if it gets worse. I really appreciate the advice and personal stories as it is really helping me a. feel like there is a way out b. I am not alone and others have conquered what I‚Äôm feeling before. So please feel free to keep commenting, it greatly helps and it can help the next person who is feeling like me and sees this thread. I can‚Äôt give much at the moment but this; you are literally saving my life. Thank you.*
Been here myself and definitely echo what everyone is saying - call crisis or get to an ED. 
- They might be able to get you some psychiatric meds or a sleeping pill so you can get some rest. 
- They should be able to help with a medical note to get some extended sick leave from work, though it may be unpaid. 
- Call 111 if you think you're imminently at risk. Yes the police triaging system is changing but they'll still be there if someone is going to or is attempting suicide

Your GP on Monday will be your primary port of call in the future, so try and book in as soon as you can.

Only seeing baby once a week has led MIL to say she nearly ‚Äòk herself‚Äô Entitled much ?,285,motherinlawsfromhell,"Change your locks immediately. 

And if she threatens to kill herself, call 911.
Your husband needs to get into therapy to help him deal with this.

Someone threatening to kill themselves should not be left alone with a baby and I would tell her that.  Along with how she needs to be discussing that in her therapy not how terrible she ""thinks"" her son is.  Has she made threats like this before?  Maybe when your husband was younger to get him to do what she wanted?

I wouldn't take the key, she probably has copies.  Just change the locks, get a door bell camera and maybe some other cameras.  When she shows up when you told her not to call the cops, explain the situation and how she has made those threats.

The calling you rude for breastfeeding says it all.  She does not really care about your daughter or her needs just herself and what she wants.  How could anyone call feeding a hungry baby rude!
Thank you so much everyone for your comments. Honestly, it has been so hard to be gaslighted into believing we‚Äôre the bad ones and it‚Äôs so refreshing to see so many people understand and reassure us that we‚Äôre not going insane! It‚Äôs her! 

We‚Äôre going to take on the advice of no contact. We have a camera and we will be changing the locks. 

We are not going to let her ruin any more of what is meant to be the best time of our lives. We tried for so long to conceive our daughter, so I am done with letting her ruin any more of it. 

Thank you again, reddit family ‚ù§Ô∏è
Tell her she's to unstable to be alone with the child and until she shows improvement she can't come over. Also get the key back.
First thing you do is change your locks and put up cameras. If she ever again says she wants to kill herself call her bluff by calling the police. Bet that'll be the last time she uses suicide as a weapon. Time to go NC and tell her she is on a 6 month time out probation. She is extraordinarily pushy, verbally abusive and frighteningly unhinged. I wouldn't let her have one second alone with your baby let alone a whole day and I dont blame you for saying no and walking out on her bullshit."
Swimming has been amazing sensory somatic therapy for me,252,CPTSDNextSteps,"I started swimming last year because the apartment I moved to has an outdoor pool. I would go swimming at night and it felt so serene and peaceful. The lights around created this beautiful view and sometimes I would have birds singing next to me. And then it was only this year that i discovered anytime I swim im at peace and no trauma can hurt me. I even tried to think about my worst flashback and it didn‚Äôt impact me at all. I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôve found swimming to be therapeutic and I hope others can find joy in it too :)
Humming a song under water while doing laps is also quite therapeutic as a lot of trauma is stored in the throat region.
Could not agree more, swimming is my absolute number one most favorite thing to do of all time. There's a pool where I live now and it sounds kind of dramatic but the positive impact to my mental health has been immeasurable, I am in that thing and grateful every single day, usually more than once. Something about the movement and the uniform sensory experience of temperature/pressure on the skin, it makes me feel so safe and calm.
My therapist actually recommended swimming to me, but I feel self conscious just being a doggy paddler at the nice gym lap pool which is the only pool in my area
Thats wonderful

I recommend sharing it in the somatic experiencing or cptsdfreeze subs"
He wasn't there to Help,217,nosleep,"Crazy! I hate in this world nowadays that most places that are meant to be ""safe spaces"" are sometimes 1000x more harmful than no help nor safe spaces in the first place

"It's been five years since I left NY ex-husband, and I'm now realizing how truly horrible he is",203,TrueOffMyChest,"Often times we don't realize how bad our situation is until we're out of it. Glad you took the initiate to get out.
That was a big growth moment. You're going to look at it for real, and you'll make peace and will feel even freer and even more yourself. I'm really proud of you, person I don't know.
It‚Äôs been close to ten years since my relationship with my ex exploded and I recently had huge revelations about it. It was because I would not have survived if I‚Äôd realised the revelations at the time. I‚Äôm really sorry you went through it all and I‚Äôm glad you were able to leave. It‚Äôs normal to have these realisations after an abusive relationship and it‚Äôs really hard. If you haven't already got one it might be good to have a therapist or counsellor who can help you explore these feelings and revelations. Good luck with it all and if you ever need it feel free to drop me a pm ‚ù§Ô∏è
When was it normal for a 19-year-old
And a 14 year old to date?

Why didn't anybody forbid this

Even if you were not sophisticated enough at the time to recognize the potential danger somebody should have
Sometimes the realization of trauma we experienced in life doesn‚Äôt pop up until much later in life, years after we endured it. I didn‚Äôt know I was sexually groomed for a good chunk of my childhood until I was much older in my life. Then the emotions come tumbling in.

When that happens, the best thing you can do for yourself is find therapy. That will give you the closure you seek in this relationship you experienced in your past. I‚Äôm proud of you for stepping away when you did and seeing the signs and protecting yourself. And I‚Äôm also so sorry that you had to experience the awful things your ex did to you. 

Healing is a process, and wounds can unfortunately reopen sometimes. You can heal again. This is going to sound corny, but one of my favorite lyrics from a song says ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the meaning of this scar, if we don‚Äôt learn how to heal?‚Äù. Remember that.

Hoping the very best for you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Edmonton Police respond to social media posts regarding a male runner that claimed he was drugged while on route.,203,alberta,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/s/eFC8vocTjq - original post
I read that story and literally thought that guy was trying to write a fiction or something
Buddy took 2 scoops of preworkout instead of one. That shit will fuck you up
His whole story read like someone trying to set up an alibi lol. He was so out of control he needed a spit mask? Sorry but as a former meth addict, that's the kind of stuff that someone might get up to if they were up for a week or two without any sleep, not from doing a bit of meth once. Also, I've had the misfortune of tasting meth. If you drank the water you would know it was tainted because it would taste like straight up chemicals.

His whole thing reads like it's straight out of some conservative propaganda about drugs. Just like those fake halloween candy stories, ain't nobody handing out free drugs. He's just humiliated that they had to mask him up like a rabid dog and wants something to blame for it other than his own monkey-brain.
The amount of holes in this guy's story was astounding. Yet most people believed him.

The iPad Pro and Stage Manager is a productivity failure.,191,ipad,"I felt the happiest when I use my iPad Pro in Split View and slide over. Keep things simple and things will be fine
Stage manager is only useful with an external screen
I have used the hell out of my 2018 pro.  It has been worked to death for damn everything.  It is the single most important idevice I own because I can use it for so many things and it can handle multiple heavy apps at once.  

But I just turned the stage manager on for the first time about two weeks ago, and it is utter garbage.  On my desktop, stage manager is very helpful.  On the iPad‚Äîpain in the ass.  I just don‚Äôt think it adds anything to the experience other than allowing me to split the screen.  

So, I agree stage manager is shit, but I disagree that the pro is a productivity failure.

Turn stage manager off.
With a mouse or trackpad, stage manager is actually great. But with just touch? Nah
There is no window flexibility on stage manager, the entire team that developed it focused on building a feature that would look good, and perform bad."

"Kamala and Tim recognize that Labor unions built the middle class, and Democrats built the unions.",173,KamalaHarris,"The working class built the Unions with their blood, sweat and tears and sometimes their lives. With ZERO meaningful help from either party. So you can take your B.S. title and shove it.  That being said, let me also say ANY union member that votes republican is 100% a class traitor.
Worker blood built unions. Which democratic leaders sacrificed their life at the battle of blair mountain? This is not a good framing for the democrats.

Vote blue, but don't pretend democrats built the unions.
Democrats are the better option. That‚Äôs bad history though.
It's a shame they botched the title, it's good information in the post. Democrats have consistently supported unions, and certainly without that support from Democratic legislatures and presidents, unions and workers would be in a much worse position today, But the hard part was done by the workers themselves.
Yeah the title is misleading too. ""America is strong when the middle class is strong, and the Unions built the middle class"" is her campaign line, which isn't the same as ""Democrats built the Unions"" at all."

It's no substitute for therapy.

Fucking dumbasses think FANDOM is a safe space??? It's a community, not therapy. Get professional help and also create tight knit friend groups WITHIN fandoms.

"Gillman Springs Road will never be ""safe"". Driving will never be ""safe"".",127,InlandEmpire,"People are selfish and they don‚Äôt fear the consequences of driving recklessly. Tailgating, going over the speed limit, passing using the bike lane. 

I‚Äôve lived in multiple parts of SoCal and it‚Äôs a problem everywhere, so I‚Äôm not so sure if it‚Äôs strongly related to poverty and mental health. Irvine has some of the worst drivers you‚Äôll ever see. 

I think it comes down to selfishness, lack of awareness, bad driving habits, no fear of the consequences and the fast paced culture of Southern California. Two ways to counteract would be an investment in public transportation and increase in ticketing for reckless driving. Sadly I don‚Äôt think our state has the resources to put either in place.
As a cyclists there are definitely some scary stretches of road out here, but what really makes riding scary isn't the road itself, it's the drivers.  Between the dumb/distracted drivers and the outright hostile drivers (how dare you ride a bike on MY road!), it really makes you choose your route carefully and question if this is even a sport you still want to do. 


The saddest part is a lot of this is all avoidable. If people just paid attention and didn't drive like assholes, things would be a lot safer.
Best thing you wrote was about RESPECT and the lack we have of it. Modes of transportation do not teach respect, parents should. People don't respect authority (teachers, police, parents, elders, others) and therfore learn not to respect speed limits, other drivers, pedestrians, etc.

The false reality thing is one that still confuses me.

NDad used to accuse me constantly of ""living in a fantasy world"" and called me delusional all the time. It was just in response to me calling him and NMom out on their shit. 

As I got older though I realized he literally did live in a fantasy world, where he was something he really wasn't, where the people in the family unit were all characters with scripted roles to play, and he was so detached from it all, that it really was a delusional fantasy world he was spinning. He lied about everything, told stories about us to strangers that weren't even real, and as bizarre as it all was, he seemed to believe himself. 

I just still question myself and feel strange for thinking that, because I was raised being told I was the delusional one.
My ndad has lied about multiple things, and I‚Äôve learned that he truly believed them due to the fantasy world he lives in. You tell him ‚Äúno I‚Äôm not coming‚Äù He hears ‚ÄúYes I‚Äôll be there‚Äù And then gets mad when you tell him you said no but he insists you said yes. It‚Äôs MADDENING. Thankfully I‚Äôve lived far away from them for a few years, but they‚Äôre moving closer (next state over) in a few months. They‚Äôve already invited themselves over for Christmas when we said we‚Äôre coming to their house for Thanksgiving and my mother in law‚Äôs for Christmas.  Husband is also having issues with his mom, so at this point, we might just disappear for Christmas. It‚Äôs gonna be ‚Äúfun.‚Äù
The religious aspect of it really is the super-fuel that makes a bad situation worse. I was raised religious, and would have terrible dreams when I was a kid. I'd wake up in a sweat. I think I was in my early 30s when I finally managed to peel all that off me. That's a trauma all by itself.

As someone with MDD (Major depressive disorder aka clinical depression (yes im officially diagnosed)) i HATE this ad with a passion

Its using a mental illness that has plagued multiple lives as something quirky and like it doesnt seem to mention anywhere that like ""hey, this test may not be accurate"" 

If you think you're depressed, ask yourself ""do i wanna kms"" if the answer is yes, you're prob depressed and should see a therapist to get diagnosed

Dont take an online test that's obv trying to leech of your mental disorder for profit (atleast im assuming they're getting money off this)

Theres also other ads from this same test that like says ppl cry blood during the test (?) which uhm obv isnt true, if you're crying blood you that doesnt mean ur depressed but theres def something wrong LMFAOOO

A tweet with over 143k likes about how men themselves do not care about men's mental health. Thoughts?,103,MensRights,"This is societal issue. How men are conditioned from young age. All this does blames men as always.
If it really mattered there wouldn't be any backlash whenever men try to create movements, institutions or pressure politics into changing these issues
So what should we do just give up ? Cuz all this does is put the blame on men again and makes their problems irrelevant it's kind a gaslighting thing going on to make men feel like they're the problem
Men have tried men‚Äôs only spaces and then women complain about it being men only and invade those spaces. Women do not care about men‚Äôs mental health and never have
It is likely true because men are often socialized to prioritize the needs of others over their own, leading to a form of internalized self-neglect. However, it's important to recognize that the argument ""they don't care for themselves"" can be applied to various groups facing less favorable circumstances. This lack of empathy for men in disadvantaged situations highlights a strong societal bias against men. For instance, consider breast cancer awareness, where significant resources are allocated to address an issue that disproportionately affects women. If same standards as men applied to women, society would have said, ""oh they just need to check themselves go to hospital, if they are not doing it they dont care themselves"" and leave it there. This disparity shows the need for a more balanced approach to empathy and support across all groups."

"I don't wish to be sick, I wish to know the name of the sickness I have",89,ChronicPain,"Incredibly frustrating thing to hear. We don't want to be sick, we want to receive appropriate care and in order to do so, we need to discover the actual cause of our symptoms. Until then, the disease is just running rampant and potentially damaging our bodies further.
You are not alone. My test results came back normal and I‚Äôm told to just take supplements and quit using cannabis, the only thing I really have for my pain. It feels like a nightmare, it feels like no one on this planet understands, except you guys here of course. It‚Äôs so frustrating. I recently quit university because of how bad my health got. I don‚Äôt even have the faith that my doctor will sign my medical leave form since they think I‚Äôm so young & normal. I don‚Äôt even recognize myself anymore, the name chronic pain doesn‚Äôt even give justice to how painful this is
Me too. It‚Äôs so frustrating not knowing what‚Äôs causing the pain and symptoms. I‚Äôm praying for all of us who are dealing with pain, anxiety and depression üíô
Don't give up. It took me 11 yrs to get diagnosed and I was diagnosed almost by accident. I've had been in a the hospital for a few days again. Dr came and said... you are just constipated because of the use of morphine. I got so extremely angry. Telling him he could not be more wrong.
I used morphine Because I had extreme abdominal pain, not the other way around.
Then I screamed And IF I was constipated WHAT THE HELL is that pain in my BACK!?
DR looked at me confused. Your Back you say? ME: Does anybody listen at all?? I keep telling you people that it starts in my back and ends in the front. DR: Can you show me? 
Me showing him. He looks at me and said I'll call neurology. Neurology  took 1!!! Look at my symptoms. Looks at me and says 
""I think I know what is wrong"" Total disbelieve on my end. But he was right. Only reason he knew was that his study buddy did research on my condition. That is why he instantly recognised it. 
And I've had so many surgeries tests etc that I started to believe it was in my head and I was thinking to myself I was a munchhauser. But then again I hated going to the Doctors and hospital. I did not need attention, I needed an answer. 
Just keep advocating for yourself. It sucks when they don't take you seriously. 
I've experienced this so many times. They were way more willing to help if my Husband would intervene. Even if I said the exact same thing he did. They rarely listen to a woman I noticed unfortunately.
Literally you 100% sound like me. I told my partner, even if it's cancer or als, i at least want to know WHY I'm so sick all the time."
How poor posture and improper exercise affected my quality of life - thought it was just anxiety and stress,87,Posture,"Thanks for sharing. I think I have many similar issues. How did you and your PT release the knots in your neck?
I have been having similar issues. Funny to stumble upon something so relatable by accident. Please let me know if your symptoms end up getting better with the work you‚Äôve been doing
Massages for releasing something have only short term effects.
This is the biggest problem in PT, sometimes they give only treatments that relief symptoms, but dont change anything longterm.


So be sure to work on the root causes, the dysfunctions, muscles weakness, etc...as you are doing with exercises.




For FORWARD HEAD/CERVICAL ISSUES:
Not just chin tucks, you need cervical extensors strenghtening too.
Mobility (rotations) and rieducation too.
Very important: Middle and Lower trapezius, for example prone T and Y/V raises exercises.




Thoracic rotations and extension mobility should be added if you have kyphotic posture,rounded shoulders and spine/sternum pain.




""Mobility"" is something needed for something specific. Not a thing that a person should do randomly with the mindset of ""more is better"".


If you are sedentary and inactive, you ll have big benefits from pilates etc.


Diaphragm breathing exercises yes.


Excessive stretching...No!
If you stretch and muscle and dont feel anything, stop.
Same as mobility, the more isnt better.
You dont need neither too short neither too long muscles.
This can confuse you, but it s how body works.






If you want you can take cervical and others exercises here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Posture/comments/1ep0a0r/if_your_posture_never_got_better_change_method_an/



At least add cervical extensions.
Suboccipital muscles(what Pt massages you) become chronically tight and overwork because the deep extensors of cervical spine arent working..so you need them, not just chin tucks.
That's pretty relateable. I've had neck pain and spent way too much time on the internet in my younger days practicing terrible posture. Once, for a few days, I felt like I was just constantly wanting to fall backwards and I wasn't sure if there was some major neurological issue or what. I workout these days and work on posture so I'm much better and haven't had that issue since. So as far as dizziness and vertigo go, it could well be due to bad posture.

I have bad anxiety too and when I do my front core tightens which makes me want to slump. The way I've handled it is, even if I'm going to be anxious, I mentally re-route that tension to more relevant muscles needed for posture. I use a stool now so I can't totally relax when sitting anyway which makes me not sit too long, which is again something I need to do.
Seems like my story. And i figured out that it's all related to posture you are on the right path and actually indeed anxiety, brain fog, tiredness it's all related to posture. Ribcage position and hip mobility.... all boils down to Posture. But correcting it is a hell of a lot of work and patience. You need to find kinesiologist or movement patterns expert. Specially trained in Bill Hartmann model.  You can start focusing on videos from greg Chaplin, Zac cupples, Bill Hartmann. It's 100 percent correctable"

Your patience and understanding (*seeing the bigger picture of who and what she really is*) has clearly paid off. It sounds like your family, and especially DH, are on the road to many years of happiness. 

Kudos! üíö
Just read your first post now. 

I definitely can see where you coming from - your priorities are first to keep your kids safe. Going after her even with the right intentions is putting them in the crosshairs. 



Trying to accuse someone that seems to have spent years and considerable energy in creating a persona for the public to see is already a monumental task and at least you were able to side step most of that while being able to protect your own.  Talk about being relieved and greatful that the distance between families is something that naturally created a barrier between her and your family.
Well done!   So nice to see you‚Äôve managed to defang her and protect yourself and your kiddos.  I wish you continued peace.
Thank you so, so much! It was an insaaaaane ride, but shoot, if that can end, maybe a lot of bad things in people‚Äôs lives can. And I‚Äôm telling you, this group really helped me stand strong."

This seems great.


But, I've got to be honest, these rules would either ve completely ignored, or, the entire restaurant industry would have to change.


Which would be a good thing IMO, I just dont see it happening.
Would be good to put in further regulations for 100 plus. It doesn't happen often, but when it does its brutal.

I feel there needs to be a cutoff point where it is no longer safe to work.
Rules and laws aren't policed now, or in the past, so how is this going to change anything? The restaurant lobby is huge and gets its way.
I'll never forget the night this really got me. We were in the middle of a summer Friday night rush and the kitchen was measuring 120 in the pass. I was on saute with all 12 eyes ripping nonstop.

About 3 hours into service, my visions started to blur. Soon after I couldn't speak or hear. My expo guy basically dragged me to the walk in. Half an hour later I was told to get back on the line, despite what had happened and there being no change in the temperature."

But I still ended up dooming scrolling on apps like YouTube. This should be my final step towards true freedom
This is beautiful. A thoughtful and motivating reflection on your experience. Thank you so much.
Thank a lot for sharing your dumbphone journey ! I enjoyed a lot reading this !

The ¬´¬†if that‚Äôs important they‚Äôll text/call¬†¬ª is so real ! I noticed that‚Äôs after switching to a dumbphone the only things that need internet on a smartphone phone are not THAT important, i always remind to myself ¬´¬†if social media or any internet based apps are so important then how were we living in the late 2000‚Äôs ? we just lived that‚Äôs it !¬†¬ª
During that time i had a a Sony Ericsson W995 that i used only for music on my way to school and to call my parents to reassure them that i arrived at school safely or if i had an emergency.
I took the bus everyday to go to school and for the bus schedule i just used the paper version, it‚Äôs as simple as that, and i survived lol.

In 2024, it feels that we need a smartphone for everything since everything get more and more digital but actually there‚Äôs no law that force ourself to get a smartphone or a phone at all, how the elderly or some disabled people do then ? Or what if your phone battery dies ? There should always be a non digital version for any task (ex : i hate qr codes menus at restaurants, is that more complicated to print out menus ? As said previously what if your battery dies or your camera is broken, you don‚Äôt eat ?).

For my experience after switching to a dumbphone lifestyle i noticed that i accept more to be bored or waiting to get at home at the end of the day to check youtube/reddit or to talk with my friends, waiting for this moment makes you appreciate it more ! It‚Äôs as exciting as waiting for a day out with your friends, you notice the precious value of the moments !
You've worded exactly this growing desire I've been having... I resonated with every sentiment of yours, with ""Clockwork Oranging myself"" and ""being force-fed the seven deadly sins"" hitting close to home, because that's exactly what I feel has worsened my experience of technology, not to speak of my overall cognitive performance (which should be alarming in and of itself!). Being born in 2001 I'm lucky enough to remember a very few years before algorithmically tailored, short-form content where using devices was exciting, as you said preparing media for yourself to enjoy in doses in the upcoming days rather than shoving down anything, instantly, shocking the brain over and over again to squeeze out some cheap pleasure. Reading this post has reminded me of all this. I'm determined to strip my cellphone of all the ""cheap pleasures"", I'm curious and excited to see how it will go :)
Thanks OP, your post resonates so much with me. I've only just started looking at this sub and I'm keen yet hesitant to make the switch. Crazy how much I view my smartphone as something of a lifeline, which on reflection is perhaps a good enough reason itself to make the switch!  
My anxious brain keeps going ""yeah but what if x, y, or z happens and you're stuck somewhere without a smartphone!?"" as if I've had one my whole life and cannot breathe without one. It's crazy how much it has a hold on me. Which is how it feels. It has started to feel suffocating, or maybe just too much like a comforter.

I was relative latecomer to smartphones and have only had one for about 10 years, but in that time my concentration span has steadily gotten worse, my sleep has gotten worse, I haven't read as many books as in the 10 years before that, etc. I am in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD (actually more ADD) and I think the smartphone just doesn't fit at all well with such neurodiversity conditions. The usage patterns, distraction and dopamine disruption, etc.  
I have come to realise that I'm addicted to my smartphone, to doomscrolling, to online shopping, to social media to some extent (I use WhatsApp and Facebook but can and do avoid them at times), er... Reddit!  
I have tried limiting it's use recently - leaving it at home a couple of times when going out for a walk, not leaving it on my bed side table at night so that I don't look at it during the night (which is perhaps the habit I loathe the most right now), etc, but these haven't stuck, as, well, like I said I'm addicted and it's not easy to give up or control because that's the nature of addiction. So I think I need to cut the cord as keeping the smartphone to use with wifi just means that I'll continue to do that all the time and just use the dumb phone for making calls and texting, and I'll end up walking around with and managing two phones which is more even more ridiculous than the situation I'm in now!

Anyway not sure why I'm putting this here. Felt appropriate rather than making my own post. I guess I just cannot fathom how one has the discipline to keep their smartphone but not continue to use it 24/7 whether it has a SIM card in or not. The lack of a simcard would only slightly curb my use and to be honest after some time - maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks, maybe longer (although likely not) - I would miss it (i.e. the dopamine cycle) so much and rationalise any excuse (which is how addiction works) to simply put the sim back in the smartphone and guiltily ditch the dumbphone. Hmm, don't think this is going to be easy for me!

Thanks again for sharing though OP!"
"No savings in SSB or Fixed Deposit or Cash. All invested in ETFs, 125k Portfolio Value",80,singaporefi,"Why do you need a helper when you are sole breadwinner. Some tough conversations may be necessary. $10k household is not huge in todays terms
Definitely save for rainy day, economy isn't looking good these days and you are essentially doomed if you have no liquid savings.

Your expenses are EXTREMELY high so that is something you may want to review first. Other pointers you can consider are the following:

- Can your wife work to increase the household income? If not is it possible to cut the helper?

- Do you really need the car? Is it an necessity or more of a convenience?

- Utilities - implement good habits to save electricity (less aircon, switching off appliances and lights when not used)

I wouldn't have a peace of mind in your  situation where you are essentially living day by day despite having a 5 figure salary. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made and it is good to teach the kids prudency from young.
You have a budgeting problem. You need to solve this problem first before going into investing. The priority for personal finance is saving, insurance, investing. There is no point planning for retirement if you cannot put food on the table today. Read up on budgeting and pick a method e.g. envelope method. Stick to it for a few months and track your expense until you can spend within your means. Put aside a sum for saving (say 20% of income) and budget the rest. Once your saving reached 6 to 12 months of your expense, you can start your investment journey. 

Learn from Singapore. Always make sure you have annual surplus and any withdrawal from the reserve need to be topped back up.
Is your wife able to contribute? Student care is not necessary. I think the 7 year old can do work at home. Child care might be useful for enrichment and socialising but see if there is a half day child care. 

Is the family eating out or eating home cooked food for all meals? 

Helper is not needed since there is child care unless it is for the elderly parent. If so consider living together and rent out parents home. 

Is your wife unable to work? I would suggest that she works and carry some of the cost. At this rate she has no extra money for herself as well. It will be too stressful for the whole family

Stop gambling.

Recommend they get themselves down to the [Booth Centre](https://www.boothcentre.org.uk/) near Strange ways, can get a warm meal and be  plugged into services and with any luck register them with a GP so they can ensure they continue to get their meds. There will be info for other services there too. Declare homeless at the town hall as well if not already. Being known in the system is important, especially in the winter as when it drops below freezing they will be put up in hotel for the night.
I know it‚Äôs a long shot, but there are food vans for the homeless each night in town, if you‚Äôve got a picture of him, it might be worth showing it to the people there. I wish you the best of luck ü§û
In my experience it is still the responsibility of his usual social care team to ensure his safety. I know he is now in a different LA but that isn‚Äôt where he lives. His home and usual services are wherever he usually resides. They have in depth knowledge of him and know that he is vulnerable and doesn‚Äôt have capacity to make these decisions. Therefore a DOLS should be initiated here to return him to his usual address and to keep him there. This is in his best interests. A person who lacks capacity to make a decision can have a DOLS put in place where a decision is then made for him in his best interests. A meeting should be being arranged between his usual professions called a best Interest meeting. 
The police may have decided he has capacity but their assessment skills are so limited and they don‚Äôt know anything about him. A social worker who knows will do a far more in depth and accurate assessment. 
Push the local social worker. It is absolutely their responsibility here!"

AITA for blocking a colleague from using our departments toilet? My current workplace drama!,67,MarkNarrations,"Has she never heard of the mid-way flush?!?! Dont wait till the end to send it down, give the plumbing a hand!!

There are other restrooms in the hospital. She may be in a multi-stall restroom instead, but that is hardly the end of the universe. Sitting across from an overflowed, blocked toilet multiple times a week from someone who doesnt even work on your floor? NTA

She may have a health issue, she works at a hospital and should be able to get some quality help.
NTA. You also kept it professional with HR from the sounds of it.
Hopefully you also told HR that in asking to share the code she was probably violating SOP.  You had no way of positively verifying her identity and given this day and age of all manner of hacking, incursions, and theft giving a door code randomly is dangerous.
My thought going through this was: does she not have one of those pre-poop toilet sprays? I bought a ton of Air Wick VIP sprays for all the bathrooms in my house and it was life changing, we all carry a spray with us when we travel now too. Especially if you're gonna be stinking up the bathroom every day, it almost feels a bit rude to not use something like that lol. But then again I don't have bowel issues, so who knows if it would work for her
NTA. You were wise to keep your answers short to HR. The ball is in her court to explain why she needs to use the bathroom on your floor.  She can either escalate or leave it alone.

She may have a problem but that doesn't give her the right to regularly block up a toilet and forget to flush creating a stink and a mess directly across from your desk.

The best solution is for her get over her embarrassment, use a regular stall and keep flushing as she poops. And carry some air freshener."
Have you ever really thought much about the impact of lead exposure on GenX?,63,GenXWomen,"Well that‚Äôs a huge bummer. And now we have microplastics too! 

But at least there is one good thing. The rich got richer!
Great news for me is my family owned a gas station when my Mom was pregnant with me, and she was there every day listening to the Watergate trial and working on the books. Extra exposure. Fabulous!
Not just lead from gas. Lead paint, lead pencils, lead drinking glasses, lead crystal glasses. My house was full of it growing up. I not only have lead in my body but mercury (my grandmother had mercury in a dropper in her medicine cabinet). We are all full of chemicals and toxins and don‚Äôt forget the food that was mass produced like cereal and other shelf stable food. I would say my generation GenX has been exposed the most since being born.
I used to play with mercury. My grandpa had a little baby food jar of it. It was fun to play with. I still have mercury fillings, too
The only ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù I have subscribed to in my whole life is that the rise of Trump and Trump-ism is due to lead exposure."
If you need to talk to someone,64,GeneralMotors,"I have been down before but never used employee assitantance programs. Are they actually helpful?

Let's say I call and say I'm depressed about job loss, or because my boss is causing me stress..what do they do?

Curious for real life reviews.
I used EAP for something else. It was useful and it helped to talk to someone objectively. 

When I got laid off several years ago one of the church groups helping with job search techniques had counseling sessions and it was very helpful. It was supposed to be a drop in group session for anyone who had lost a job but I was the only one who showed up each week so it was very one on one and specific to my situation. I was dealing with contractor jobs ending abruptly due to changes in the business needs as well as long distance eldercare.  

Talking things out with someone who is objective can be very helpful.
It's ok to be not ok
Since you only get 3 visits through it I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just a legal CYA by GM for if/ when an employees commits suicide. They can claim they offered support regardless of whether they were a contributor to the persons mental state. 

That was true for the other company I worked for that had ‚Äúfree‚Äù emergency mental health services like this and GM hasn‚Äôt done anything to make me think they are different or more concerned for our wellbeing.
I have found it incredibly helpful and used it consistently throughout my employment as a short-term counseling avenue. What you talk about with the licensed counselors is strictly confidential. My understanding and experience are below: 

It is short-term counseling (usually up to 5 hour-long sessions after the intake session). When you call, after some logistical questions and verification, a licensed counselor will answer the phone and does an intake session with you to understand what brings you to counseling (generally 30min-1hr). After the intake session, they let you know if they recommend the further counseling sessions for you to work through the issue. (I haven't had them not offer the additional counseling sessions). They can be telephone sessions, video sessions, sometime in-person sessions. Telephone sessions they can generally schedule you pretty quick for the sessions, generally less quick for the video and generally much less quick for the in-person. If after the sessions you want to continue, they're happy to work with you to keep that counselor or find additional counseling, it just wouldn't be covered through the EAP."

Psych patients and countertransference,59,ausjdocs,"My dear mentor, who was an ICU Consultant, would often tell me: ""There's already a long line of people waiting to call this person an asshole. Don't get in that line. Get in the other line, much shorter, of people who have a professional obligation to look after them.""

I deal with my feelings by acknowledging them and setting them aside; it's only relevant to their care insofar as it's a significant source of bias. Plenty of coronial inquests are about unsavoury people who, no matter their unsavouriness, didn't deserve to die.

You used a great word, countertransference, and perhaps this is a good time to reflect on why their behaviour provokes such strong feelings in you. How would your parents have delt with you if you behaved like this?
Psych Reg here to add my two cents.


The most important and difficult thing about counter-transference is recognizing that you're experiencing it. So kudos on you for reflecting on that!


It's important to recognize counter-transference, firstly because it is associated with burnout and therefore it is important to recognize and manage it before it leads to your work being affected. A debrief with a trusted colleague or even a non-work friend (can be a very casual debrief) can go a long way in dealing with counter transference and avoiding it's negative impact. One trick that my supervisor taught me was doing a mindless or a mundane task after a particularly difficult work day can help reset some of the countertransfer (I do this by either putting on a sitcom that I enjoy and have watched many times before or scrolling on my phone).


Secondly, it's important to recognize counter-transference because you're not obligated to like everyone you treat but you are obligated to treat everyone to the best of your abilities and negative counter-transference can lead to sub-consciously providing sub-standard care to that pt. So it is important to recognize that you're experiencing negative countertransfer from a pt and making sure you're still treating them the same way you would treat any other pt.


Lastly, knowing the underlying cause of the pts' behavior can go a long way in developing empathy towards them and managing countertransfer. The example you gave of the pt who takes no responsibility and puts everything on others. That is very commonly seen in pts with cluster B traits and it's called having an ""external locus of control."" It can stem from having horrible things done to you in the past and your agency being taken away that you start viewing the world as having no control in it. It can also be a maladaptive coping/defense mechanism - your life is so miserable that it is easier and more comforting to blame everyone else for it than to consider that you might have contributed to it yourself or take responsibility that you have a role to play to fix it (which is a lot more daunting thing to confront).
I find kicking them out cathartic to be honest. 

Being a psych reg is a lot like being a car salesman. You can find enjoyment in being able to convince these people to follow the plan you have outlined. 

The PC answer is that these people often have went through significant trauma and a lot of the things they say are clues to pathology underneath. It‚Äôs more enjoyable when you see them as a puzzle to understand rather than someone being a dick
Psych Reg here - it is complicated and you have to look beyond the behaviour.

countertransference/transference and projection identification is a very powerful defence mechanism and way of seeking help/getting needs met/pulling people close/attachment seeking behaviour. 

  
projection identification involves projecting for example their own hatred of self onto the doctor. The doctor then internalises this and projects it back onto the patient. Ultimately fulfilling the patients belief they are a bad person. 

This behaviour is unconsciously driven.

You have to consider the vulnerability of this person. And the psychological regression that is entailed in a hospital admission. Behaviour regression, acting out, escalating behaviour to elicit responses. 

Some people have a background where the only time they were ""held"" by their parents was in restraint. So using aggression is a way to draw near. 

You also have to consider re-enactments which are occurring between the patient and yourself.  for example Re-enacting relationships with care-givers (or lack there of) 

You also have to consider the power dynamics at play - Mental health act, involuntary treatment. Persons who have a background of trauma are very vulnerable to power dynamics.

What Im saying is you have to display empathy and reflect on how this person makes you feel. If you feel irritated i bet they feel irritated. IF you hate them I bet they hate themselves.
The points being made by other commenters are absolutely valid: these are symptoms of underlying disorders/unmet needs etc so there is still work to be done on some level.

However, if you're dealing with an asshole, you can provide all the empathy in the world. You can sympathise with every trauma and disadvantage that life has thrown their way. You can be fully understanding of how they ended up being an asshole.

But they're still an asshole.

If you don't acknowledge that, and acknowledge the response it generates in you and the toll it takes just interacting with some patients, you will end up accruing a whole heap of negative emotions that you won't process until it is too late and you, too, hath become yonder asshole.

Do your best. Sometimes, you'll get to see that crystallizing moment where someone actually internalises a change, but you'll miss that opportunity if you're burning all your empathy on every single person that comes through the door.

Look after yourself, and look after your team. If you feel this way, the nurses and fresher doctors might be copping it more consistently but trying to appear professional by suppressing all of this until they pop. Coffees, donuts and debriefs (even if it's just a quick ""Christ, how frustrating was that guy yesterday!?"") go a long way to making people feel okay about being meat for the healthcare machine."
"Cut off ‚ÄúFriend Group‚Äù, along with MOH title. ",59,weddingdrama,"Hugs friend. It sounds like you have a lot going right now. Don‚Äôt waste any more energy on people who aren‚Äôt a net positive to your life.
Hey there.  You're having Quite A Time, aren't you?  My mom was an alcoholic too.  It was hard for me to learn that she was an adult and in control of her own life and if she knew her lungs were going bad but still smoked, they were her lungs and it was her life.  I eventually learned that she was the only one who could change her behavior.  I'm not going to suggest meetings to you; you don't need more things to do, but you might want to start reading the Adult Children of Alcoholics website.  Don't expect magic from reading it; the tough times you had growing up had a cumulative effect on you, and I discovered that it's work to get rid of the cumulative effects.  But on bad days you can read a few things and they might give you a new perspective.

Your friends don't deserve you now, and sure didn't deserve you in the past, either.  What a bunch of jerks.  You're much better than them and have far more manners to boot.  You're way too busy for their shenanigans.  I have a relative who acts like your friends; it took me a long time to come to grips with the realization that she's changed too much to be my friend anymore.  She's mean, she carries grudges other people don't even know she has, and she badmouths people all the time.  If she's mad, she'll say nasty things about you for days to everyone who crosses her path, and if she later finds out she was wrong, she doesn't bother correcting what she said so that everyone else still thinks you did the horrible thing she imagined.

Hugs to you.  You're going to move forward and do well, because you have a good attitude and are kind.  Never doubt your ability to do well.  If you get a chance, report back and let everyone know how well you're doing!
It sounds like you are cleaning garbage from your house and restarting your life!!!

I cut my mom off and wish I‚Äôd done it 25 yrs earlier.
I gotta say, I only read your first post just now, but these ladies don‚Äôt sound like they are your friends. I‚Äôm sure YOU were a friend to them, but they appear to either be classist mean girls or be totally comfortable having their lives run by a classist mean girl. 

I can‚Äôt make this not hurt, but I can promise you that if you keep working on and investing in -yourself- like you have been, you will meet much, much better friends in the future.
These people are what my mom called fair weather friends. Only come around when things are good, and nowhere to be found when you need them. It won't be long before you'll be grateful you're not a part of that group of harpies anymore."
Allegations that DogPack Hasn‚Äôt Discussed,54,mrbeastsnark,"[deleted]
He may not be a perpetrator of DV, but he is still besties with Lacoya Hill and is likely directly involved in keeping him employed in spite of the credible allegations against him.


That Surprise Witness actually talks about this in her video that DP404 mentions and she outright says she doesn't think the MrBeast James Warren is the same one in the DV case. I'd have to go back and watch DP404s video again, but I don't think he definitely says they are one in the same person - doesn't he say something like, ""apparently there are a lot of guys in NC named James Warren who beat their girlfriends""? 


He definitely jumped to the conclusion though, that just b/c the MrBeast James Warren seems to be a lying fraudster, he is also an abuser.
That Surprise Witness did a reaction to Dogpacks 2.5 vid and made the point that there‚Äôs no empirical evidence that JW has any charges against him for DV. 

She‚Äôs a lawyer so comes with that background, and does a really thorough job of researching and explaining what she finds. Would recommend her second channel BJ Investigates as well.
That sub is awful, never seen a more inestable sub than that one. It sucks cause generally they have a lot of information and they explain ‚Äúdrama‚Äù well but some of the comments are so pathetic
I think it's also because he puts his full trust in his sourceS. Even some say they witnessed the abuse themselves. Personally, I don't know exactly what's going on (as per his replies on twitter), but he really should have postponed this case first before showing it. I know he says he's confident, and I want to trust him , I genuinely really do, but this really should have been postponed for later when actual evidence has come out. Other than that, I personally don't think it's okay to discredit everything, I mean everything that he's already shown to us. That's just super weird. Especially the ones wishing him an ill fate. Like wtf. But he really should own up to his mistake if he ever made one.

It just worries me that I think.. is he naive? He believes the people giving him all these sources will defend him/ the sources they've shared? Maybe it's just me being cynical and cautious but it's better to thread carefully trusting these people, these info, heck even himself. People can say what they wanna say about jake weddle, but at least he's willing to show up and give face to the claim. 

Other than that, I hope the other interviews from former employees will come out sooner, as well as any info about the DV, animal abuse part, etc if any. Hopefully anything substantial, regardless of what that may be."
My AI companion system,57,artificial,"Amazing. I see a lot of promise in AI helping with mental health. Your setup sounds cool.
Your story is a heavy hearted one, and appreciate the depth of your sharing here. I'm totally impressed by your willingness to fight and work at making a life that works for you. Few even try. 
I'm somewhat in a similar situation and am curious what the back end of all this might look like, software wise. Is all this in containers in proxmox? 
I have so many questions, and wondered if you would be willing to share further so others could maybe try to get something like this running too. Again thanks for the inspiration.
Genuinely wish I could hang out with someone like you
This is fascinating, thanks so much for sharing!

>Memory is handled by Vector database, weighted graphs and pure text files, allowing the AI to grow a database of knowledge of myself, past conversations and likes, dislikes and mental health.

I'd love to know more about how this sort of thing works.  I know how an LLM can use a vector DB, but what kinds of use cases does your system do with it?  Do you have some sort of prompt template or standard prompts that tell it to always consider certain kinds of memories for certain kinds of prompts?

Edit: and does the system write to these places and if so how and when?
It‚Äôs amazing how you've turned technology into such a supportive part of your life. I love how each AI has its own personality and role‚Äîreally shows the thought and care you‚Äôve put into this. It‚Äôs cool to see how it‚Äôs all coming together for you. Thanks for sharing your story, it's really inspiring!"

"I have someone who knows I have cptsd, and they constantly bombard me with bad advice, cloying questions about my trauma, and trigger me. How do I make them stop.",47,CPTSD,"You need to set clear boundaries. Tell them ""Hey, I know you're just curious but I really am not comfortable with these kinds of questions. They make me feel (overwhelmed/angry/etc). The next time you bring this up I will have to (end our conversation/hang up/change the subject/leave the room, etc.)"" And then when they do it again, firmly remind them they crossed a boundary and follow through. If they keep doing it, communicate to them that your friendship may not being able to continue. 

If they care about you and are a healthy relationship to have, they should at the very least try to respect your boundaries. Having mental illness themselves is not an excuse. If you are clearly communicating to them that ""This thing you are doing hurts me"" and they ignore it and keep hurting you, its not a good friendship to have, imo. But if you want to try to salvage the relationship, you first have to assume ignorance and be SUPER clear and serious that these questions are not okay and you need to protect yourself.
What you‚Äôre feeling is entirely normal and appropriate for the situation. If someone does not respond to repeated request and statements about their behavior than they are in capable of addressing the issue at some level and it‚Äôs up to you to decide if you‚Äôre going to continue to tolerate that or separate yourself. One of the problems with CPTSD is a lot of the times we don‚Äôt have very good understanding of our boundaries or respect for them. You‚Äôre frustrated because you‚Äôre not respecting your boundary and allowing this to continue you need to shut off the conversation and walk away, and if that doesn‚Äôt get taken because this person doesn‚Äôt get it or doesn‚Äôt choose to get it and for that I feel for you and you have my empathy
Set a boundary with them. ""That's something I don't talk about."" Or ""That's something I don't want to hear about."" 

Full stop. Change of subject. If they persist, walk away. And if they don't stop, cut them out of your life. 

You're in charge and setting your boundaries is a healthy thing to do!
Boundaries and consequences. Be clear, concise, and leave no room for misunderstanding.

You could tell them that you will not answer those questions anymore, and if they continue to ask, tell them what will happen. It might be that you ignore them, it might be that you leave the room, whatever it is I recommend a passive approach that just disengages from the conversation. Anything that engages them actively could be read as you encouraging/enabling them, even though that's the last thing you want.

A lot of people who are invasive, enmeshed, or resistant to boundaries will complain that a boundary is an attempt to control them. So, just in case they bring up that argument, remind them that you are not controlling them. They can do what they want. And you can do what you want, such as immediately leaving the conversation. You are controlling *your* behavior.

Finally, a boundary is not a punishment. It's something you do for yourself to move through life more easily. You deserve that, and it's not inconveniencing anyone else. It can be hard and uncomfortable to establish a new boundary, especially if you've known someone for a long time. But sometimes that also works in our favor ‚Äî if they think they know us well, showing our assertive side can catch them off guard and inspire them to take us more seriously.

It all depends so much on the person, but I hope some of this helps!
Tell them to stop asking questions like that.
""Trauma is uncomfortable and unless I bring it up or it's relevant to some discussion we're already having please don't bring it up. It's triggering.""

Just say it. Flatly. No anger or upset. 

Set clear boundaries and then watch. If they don't respect your boundaries you need to cut them out. No matter how old or clueless they are."
Proposed OSHA indoor heat rule ,47,Serverlife,"Does this include places that aren‚Äôt restaurants? I worked at a place that was open air, and the temperature was regularly 90+ degrees in the summer and triple digits on the second floor.

Some tips for avoiding the dreaded account suspension by Fidelity (redux),48,fidelityinvestments,"I deposit and use lots of checks on my account and have had no issues. But my account(s) have age on them.
I really appreciate the write up. I, too, am worried about a sudden account suspension.

But just to add some data points:

* I used **mobile deposit** all the time, even with my paychecks. No issues (so far).
* And any **paper** **check** I write (not as common these days, but still once in awhile) is against my Fidelity account. I have written payments of $9k and $15k to contractors in recent months. No issues (so far).
* I use the Routing/Account for both **PayPal** and **Venmo**. The amounts are admittedly pretty small, but no issues (so far).
* I pull money from **external accounts** all the time. I know it's preferred to push from the external bank, but I've had no issues so far. Also, the pull from Fidelity always FAST, sometimes faster than pushes from the external bank. It's available same day for trading if i want, but overnight to settle. I kept a time stamped log of various testing from various financial institutions.
* I'm not sure if these qualify as **large amounts**, but I've transferred to/from TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab ($20k ish). No issues (so far).
* I do have **margin** on. All money transfers above are against a brokerage account, not a CMA.
been with Fidelity for about 30 years.  absolutely no issues at all
This is a lot of unnecessary precaution that defeats the purpose of most people wanting to use a financial firm. Half of what you hear on Reddit is going to be an over exaggeration or half-truth as you‚Äôre only getting one side of the story. In reality though, don‚Äôt be nasty (curse/threaten) when you call a company, don‚Äôt have trading violations (buy more than you can afford, try to game the system unethically), don‚Äôt overdraft your card or write bad checks. Like any financial institution, there are some things Fidelity can‚Äôt control that will negatively affect you- court orders to lock down your account, AML or similar issues being flagged, etc. If you follow the rules that you should have with ANY financial institution, you have a 99% chance of never having an issue. last add- make sure to designate someone on your account that your financial firm can contact if they have concerns of your well being (diminished capacity) and set up your beneficiaries so your heirs can move forward without much trouble when you pass. Oh, and tell someone where your assets are located so they don‚Äôt have to go on a hunt while trying to mourn you.
For larger amounts, a wire transfer, despite its expense, may be the best way to fund an account.

ACH can be reversed, perhaps even after settlement. Wire transfers cannot, at least without significant human intervention.  Fraud looks like a deposit in, high risk trading, possibly before settlement, and then an unexpected reversal or withdrawal. Fraudsters don't want to use wires as much because there is human intervention on both sides, and it costs money.

Ultimately a wire transfer can go to gross settlement with FedWire, which is the final system of record for US dollars, transferring between institutions by the Federal Reserve system.

>The Fedwire Funds Service is the premier electronic funds-transfer service that banks, businesses and government agencies rely on for mission-critical, same-day transactions. Fedwire Funds Service participants benefit from the finality of payments credited to their Federal Reserve Bank master accounts

A whale who is a valuable customer will wire in a large amount and then invest normally.

Also a margin may help protect Fidelity as well as it gives them the right to liquidate securities to meet cash debits."

Strong week! 

I‚Äôm really enjoying Dome‚Ä¶I mean Ocean Keeper! Takes a while to get enough upgrades to get going but it‚Äôs a solid premium title. I‚Äôd recommend a controller.

My wife has been feeling so much better since she got her service dog. She's (Sky, the SD) all business when it's time to work, and at home when she's not *technically* working (Still keeps attention on wife for anything going on) she gets to be more of a normal dog. She ***loves*** playing tug of war with my hands and shoes.

I‚Äôm glad you don‚Äôt think the stress of he public I going to be a problem for you.  I have tattoos, blue or purple hair, and a pink wheelchair, but never have I felt the kind of attention that I get when I have my service dog with me, because it‚Äôs not only non stop, it‚Äôs hard to get rid of them!  I hate to be rude, but I just want to shop and get home, and not get into a political argument with someone over disability rights, dogs in stores, or listen to more dead dog stories, lol"

"Grew up poor, just graduated with masters ‚Äî no financial know-how. Any guidance for repayment plan? Owe 200k",41,StudentLoans,"Goodness gracious. Uh. You need to find government work and just play the long game and minimize your monthly payments and hope for forgiveness at 20 (edit: 10) yrs of consistent payments. Unless you can find a way to increase your income substantially or find growth a couple years in.
If you can work 30+ hours a week, you can try to see if you qualify for PSLF if you work in the public/non-profit sector

The income-based plans and PSLF were made for folks like us. I'm a clinical social worker, and I understand the major burden it feels to have an outstanding amount. 

The income-based plans helped me a lot to not feel like I was living paycheck to paycheck
To take a step back, in terms of strategy the goal is to minimize the amount you pay out of pocket to fulfill your loan obligation. How exactly you go about that really depends on your income and loan debt situation. Which option is cheapest for you overall can require scratch paper and time to figure out, since you sorta have to project out scenarios over a 10-25 year timeline and make some assumptions

For federal loans in your own name, you kinda have to decide between 1) aggressive repayment, 2) waiting out IDR plan forgiveness, or 3) pursuing a forgiveness program like PSLF or similar.

If you owe $200k and you make $30k? You want an IDR plan and to look into PSLF-qualifying employment options. As per https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-court-actions you can apply for an IDR plan with the paper/PDF app but it won't be processed for awhile due to the litigation blocking SAVE. That said, you can apply and then request a forbearance

Past that? I highly recommend people check out the r/personalfinance money management advice in their [prime directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) wiki (which also has a [flow chart version](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png)) since it makes good financial management incredibly straightforward.
Wow. This is a doozy. 

PSLF, as others mentioned is your best bet. 

Good luck!
PSLF pretty sure you have to work at least 30hrs a week"

We're forgetting a vital detail: Andrew was just 14.,35,AndrewGosden,"I think people underestimate his intelligence whilst overestimating his level of social awareness and independence. I was friends with someone like him through secondary school before I moved for A-Levels and at 14 he was sitting the local maths and spelling bee olympiads and held gold prizes in regional maths competitions. I always felt that whilst he was academically smart he was remarkably naive and poorly socialised owing to his preference to spend most of his time at home or in school clubs. 

With this in mind even though grooming is a likely theory, it's equally as likely that he was simply a naive young boy who met an unlucky and unfortunate end. 

***as always: if you have a tip, please submit it--no matter how small***
100% I was a moron at 14. Tho being a girl
I maybe was slightly more wary of certain situations.
Very valid points, I'm now leaning towards it being an impulsive decision on the day to just see where the day took him
I don't think you can so easily generalise about 14 year olds. In many ways I was more cautious as a kid than I am now, as I've had life experience to know it'll probably be okay and ah well if it isn't. I was a real worrier when I was 14.

My point is that the stereotype about kids being impulsive and lacking caution isn't always true. Andrew going to London was impulsive, I'll grant that, but it doesn't mean he had no caution at all.

Also, the idea we've missed something in not considering his age is quite strange to me as that's been a large part of the concern from day one.
I have a friend who works in the MoJ on research work to do with the most horrific crimes, and when I mentioned this case to her she said very matter of factly: ‚Äúoh that case. Probably human trafficking. He looked like a much younger kid - someone tricked him and he was done for. It happens way more than people think.‚Äù

I found it interesting that many people deride human trafficking theories as being far fetched, yet this person who works in a field that researches that kind of crime specifically said it‚Äôs a likely case of it."

Not sure if someone mentioned this but if you MUST answer from your laptop, then my answer is simple: tether your laptop wifi from your cell phone so you can bring your laptop basically anywhere you'd like. Put the same email app on your phone  so you get notified when an email comes in...then make yoir way to the laptop!

I've been working from home for 9 years but I am flooded with work and use multiple screens for my job. You have a perfect scenario to work literally anywhere you want! I'd plan a trip to the beach or river or really anywhere you're cell phone has service. I find that just having a change of scenery will boost your energy or at least make you feel less depressed.

Buy a little foldable table, hit the beach and answer emails from the sand. Go to the mall and just people watch. You don't know it yet but you have the best work setup most dream of.

"If you can, GO TO THIS VA BENEFITS LIVE EVENT SEP12-14!",33,VeteransBenefits,"Wow. Do other regional offices do these type of events? Like in TX?
I can 100% agree that if there is any chance you can attend I highly recommend it. I went to the same event wanting to get an update on 2 pending claims. The first claim seemed to be a no brainer, the C&P exam was completed, it seemed like all the docs were there so I thought maybe I could get it rated on the spot. The second claim was for PTSD. I've been waiting on a C&P exam and my goal for that claim was to get an exam scheduled. When I sat down with a rater we talked about the reason for my visit and we started with the PTSD claim.

Side note: Prior to this event I had a C&P exam for insomnia secondary to GERD. Ultimately the examiner opined the insomnia was not connected to GERD but based on the hour and a half exam the examiner determined my PTSD and other MH conditions were caused while in service. So with that information I submitted a secondary claim for PTSD. 

So, during the conversation with the rater I told him I had an exam for insomnia and the DBQ should be listed. The rater found the DBQ, read through it and said, ""@#%@%, I can't understand why someone didn't pick this up. I can get this knocked out in about 30 minutes."" I was, ""let's do this."" At that point I thought the rater was going to walk me out and work on it a little later but instead the rater took care of everything as I watched. When he finished, he got in a chat with another team who does the QC & approvals and told them he was sending my claim over. The rater got a response from the other team saying I was next. I was impressed. Not wanting to push my luck, I had to ask about the first claim. The rater told me since it was a PACT Act claim it need a deeper look. I accepted that answer and thanked the rater for all of his help. 

As I drove home I kind of expected it would take VA a week or so to get everything wrapped up and determine my rating. It was an hour drive from the event to the house. When I got home I checked my overall rating just for shits & grins, I was floored. I went from 90% (86% in total) to 100% (96%). It turns out I was rated 70% for PTSD. Needless to say, I was speechless. I was amazed for the small investment of 5 hours, (driving to and from the event, wait time & discussion with the rater) I managed to get my rating over the top. But it doesn't stop there, about a week later I received the decision letter and was surprised I ended up at 100% P&T.

I highly recommend if at all possible, try and go to this event next week. I can't say you'll end up with same rating but at least you'll be able see how sausage is made. It could be well worth your time. Good luck.
Thanks for that. 

Will make an effort to attend.

Would having ADHD make me eligible for having studietoeslag?
Non-EU students do not qualify for study finance, so they also don't qualify for this.

EU students be able should qualify in theory, but they need to work to get study finance and this seems to be targeted at students unable to work.
No, it seems not. Because you must receive student finance to be eligible. As an international student you must work to get student finance. If you work you are not eligible for the studietoeslag.

So it's eligible for those students who have a residence permit for asylum or an indefinite residence permit and for students who have a specific residence permit type 1. But not for students who have a residence permit for study.

I think it is one of the benefits from public funds that can end your right of residence. It's eligible for those EU-students who receive student finance because they have been living in The Netherlands for five consecutive years or because their parent or partner with EU-nationality work or have been working in the Netherlands."

"I hated politics on twitter, so I removed it using AI to better my mental health",29,simpleliving,"I'm surprised by some comments. OP analyses that something is affecting the simplicity of their life and correct it to feel better in their life, takes time to share it with us. And yet I see mean comments almost suggesting OP could be part of the problem (leopard etc.) ? See, this urge to accuse people of something, this phrasing, is exactly the kind of behavior people like OP (and myself) are sick to read on social medias. 4 years on this subreddit and never saw commente like that. Please be better.

Also, in all this media consumption, it is recommended by mental health professionals to do exactly that : filtering what you see. There was always tragic news, events, deaths. The technology today just make it noisier. Lowering the volume does't make you stupid, or an accomplice. You can be conscious that there is a political conflict without eating every news about it. And even if people want to be blind to this, well let them live their life simply.

Also, there is a diff√©rence between getting content with intent, and passively getting it : I use twitter to follow news about my hobbies, share my work, and follow my industry. I don't want to see a video of hostages executed, I don't want to know who got killed, injured, insulted, etc. while I'm just scrolling.¬†

tl;dr: kindly let people share their simple life tricks without judging them, and be better.

"To everyone going on 30/31 and has bought tickets from viagogo, stubhub et al - read this!",29,adele,"Point n.4 happened to me. Nowhere in the emails it told me that the link would expire at a certain point. Spent 1 hour with the viagogo Customer Care standing in front of the venue - they offered an alternative ticket, but they were already sold out. This would have been the only concert I went in the last 10 years, but couldn‚Äôt.
1. At one point, it was stated that screenshots are explicitly encouraged. This was pointed out to me by another user, and I then read it in official communication. 
2. Once you accept transferred tickets, they cannot be taken back by the seller. 
3. I‚Äôve never had issues with fake tickets from Stubhub or viagogo. Their customer service and guarantee are quite strong. 
4. The *only* issue I‚Äôve had is purchasing too late, and the seller was unable to transfer. I was able to directly contact the seller, they sent me screenshots of the tickets, and a photo of their ID, and I had zero issues. Obviously, if you purchase too late and the transfer isn‚Äôt completed in time, you may not be so lucky.
Got a ticket at viagogo for 170 EUR. Ticket was worth 399. All worked out fine and I had an amazing night :) 
Four other people had the same experience with viagogo.
Glad, you are pointing this out and hoping, lots of people concerned see this. Buy your tickets from ticketmaster or eventim, associated with ticketmaster.

Last week, I was very close to buying a ticket on stubhub (row C, just 120 Euros) but then remembered it was just too good to be true. - Then I read the reviews. Frightening!

I ended up with a ticket twice the price from ticketmaster but legit.
The issue is that I wanted to sell mine through Ticketmaster.de but they weren‚Äôt allowing ticket resales until less than a week before the show. I wasn‚Äôt willing to take the chance, so I sold through viagogo. I made sure that the buyers accepted the tickets into their account so they could be properly used. I just wish the promoter would have allowed resales a long time ago. I guess they didn‚Äôt sell out and didn‚Äôt want to have to compete with the resale tickets."

I‚Äôm a labor historian. To say the Democrats built unions is not only false, but also disrespectful to the thousands of working class people who died fighting for workers‚Äô rights. While our national rights came from FDR signing the NLRA into law in 1935, that only happened because of the decades and decades of the working class who fought for those protections. You can also thank socialists, anarchists, and communists for these rights. 

Here are a few places to read and learn about labor history: 

- [Working Class in American History](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/find_books.php?type=series&search=WCA) series published by the University of Illinois 
- [Historical Overview of Labor Unions in the United States](https://www.wisconsinlaborhistory.org/united-states-labor-history/) published by Wisconsin Labor History Society
- [Important Events in American Labor History, 1778-1978](https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/irle/ucb/text/lb000093.pdf)
- [Civil Rights and Labor History Consortium](https://depts.washington.edu/labhist/) published by the University of Washington
Do you give credit to the French aristocracy for how easy their heads came off on Bastille day too?
Democrats absolutely did *not* build unions.

Trade unions were formed by socialists and communists, get out of here with this historical revisionism."
AITA for not 'being over my medical trauma'?,28,MarkNarrations,"NTA, but that stranger is a huge one.

For context, I used to work in a hospital.  I have PTSD caused by another situation, but the stuff I saw attending codes and various situations in the trauma room still causes me problem.  That was over 10 years ago and it didn't even happen to me or someone I knew, I was just a witness to it.

The experience you went through hit you on several levels and it was prolonged.  You are learning to live your life with those memories and feelings.  It's not about 'getting over it'.  One phrase I was told about living with my PTSD is ""you have to engage with the dragon that bit you.""

That stranger had no idea what you went through.  She has no right to judge you.  She is no dragon fighter like you are.
I didn't even have to read your post to make a determination, but of course I did. Everyone processes trauma at different rates. That harridan had had no business in your conversation and even less telling you to get over your trauma because it was two years ago.

You are 100% NTA, but she sounds like a right See You Next Tuesday.
NTA you didn‚Äôt just go through a trauma. There was a whole bunch of traumas right after each other.
NTA. I've been in a similar situation: went to the hospital for something potentially life-threatening (surgery included) followed by returning to the hospital a week later due to illness contracted at the hospital. It happened when I was a child, and it left me with health-related anxiety for years. You're not alone, and you're not crazy.

I'm not saying it'll never get better. It will. Trauma responses, when addressed and treated (which you're already doing), lessen with time. Your anxiety is perfectly normal. It sucks, and it'll probably keep sucking for a while, but it is very normal to feel hyper anxious about your health after an experience like yours for years after that experience.

It's also very normal to doubt yourself, especially when people like that stranger challenge the validity of your reactions, but you know what? That stranger didn't go through what you went through. She had no idea what she's talking about! She's just a bitter, judgemental jerk who, for whatever twisted reason, thinks that being an AH to a stranger will give her a nice serotonin dump. Bullies get older, but that doesn't mean they grow up.

I'm so, so sorry you went through all of that! I hope things get better for you.
trauma is a real thing, and it can last a very long time, with the sufferer healing on their own time and under their own terms. absolutely no one else has any right to dictate when you should get over it.

those who dare to presume to, can go sit on a cactus, and pick a fight with a cobra chicken(canadian goose) and are absolutely daft sausage muppets.

NTA, and I'm sorry you experienced such a completely unpleasant person and wish you a complete recovery."

My dad bought a house for me (m26) and it is ruining my relationship with my gf (f23) am I the controlling one?,28,relationship_advice,"Why in the world are you still with this horrible person? You say you feel like you're being manipulated. I don't even think manipulation goes far enough to describe her absolutely abysmal behavior. Cut this woman out of your life forever and never let her back in.
Please break up with her. You‚Äôve been nothing but great to her, and she‚Äôs taking advantage of your kindness, while projecting her behavior onto you.  

Also consider seeing a therapist to learn how to assert your own boundaries, both with your partner and your father. I wish you well.
[removed]
She is a terrible human being ,why do you allow her to treat you like that?

Record every single interaction with her and with the presence of someone broke up !Tell her to leave now and change the lock and put cameras in your house. Capture every messages/phone calls to have a restraining ordre because she will try to make a mess knowingly how she speak about you now. So be preparedis

A woman who dont respect her man is not in love with him she just use him for her purpose until she live. So throw her away from your life and go work on yourself to not allow same situations! Never be scared to leave When someone treat you badly,respect is a must for anything!
You don't have a relationship with your girlfriend.  She's a user and ungrateful for everything.  It's all transactional. Dump her ASAP."
"Health vs Happiness, Nights vs Days",27,hospitalist,"If someone asked me to write-up a profile of someone who would be well-suited to doing nights, it would be someone who is a natural night-owl, doesn‚Äôt have any familial commitments that require them to be awake during the day, doesn‚Äôt have hobbies that rely upon other people being available, and who stays nocturnal on their time off. All of these seem to apply to you. ¬†

The only thing that puts me off doing nights is the fact that it doesn‚Äôt seem particularly compatible with family life.
Not much to add but just saying hello as a fellow nocturnist that loathes days and found a lot of joy working with the night crew at my hospital. I have a suspicion that as we age night becomes harder to sustain, at least personally as I passed 40. You may want to consider lean FIRE and work 0.5 - 0.7 FTE if the physical drain is taxing later on in your career rather than switching to days (eww)¬†
Thank you for being the night doc.
i‚Äôve been doing it for 10 years . .7 fte , plenty of off , being able to take 2 weeks vacation time twice a year. the side effects of nocturnal lifestyle was studied only on population of blue collar workers so it may not reflect hospitalist population . good luck
Sounds like me, but with more social interaction, lol. I've forgotten how to do days, and working clinic is an alien concept to me."
Have you ever been scammed by this guy? ,28,Instagram,"Nope. To be honest with you I would never trust that Joe Dirt looking fella anyways. Life is a garden dig it. Dang. Got to keep on keeping on.
Why would you fall for that? All you can do is dispute it with your bank.
I don‚Äôt know how people can miss posts that say ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust Account Recovering‚Äú-they are fake and will happily take your money!  Once you give your money to a scammer it‚Äôs gone forever.  Be glad it was only 300 bucks.  Do some research on scammers-it might help the next time you‚Äôre confronted with one!
Account recovery is not a thing. Everyone who claims it is‚Ä¶ is a scammer.
That guy actually looks like a scammer based on the pic he posted of himself"

She isn't going to change.  Have you tried therapy to overcome your anxiety? Maybe eventually you can hold a WFH job or one where you interact with people minimally.
Have you talked to his parents about her?
Dealing with nasty in-laws is difficult. I am so sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with this. As other commenters say, this behavior will probably not go away. Unfortunately, you and your boyfriend need to sit down and talk about possible boundaries. As long as you and your bf are on the same page, you will be ok. From personal experience, getting parents involved in adult sibling drama is a recipe for disappointment. If you see them actively enabling her behavior, don‚Äôt be surprised if they defend her behavior to you and your bf. It‚Äôs sad, and it sucks. I know anxiety can really deter you from getting a job, but for your own mental health and the health of your relationship with your bf, I would recommend finding a way to cope with your anxiety. Counseling/medication or whatever else!"
"[MEGATHREAD] Daily venting, worries, fixations, & finding support. Month of September 2024.",24,HealthAnxiety,"When one symptom leaves another one comes‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like an unending spiral of anxiety‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just so tired (mentally and physically) of it all
Last week it was MS. This week, after I noticed that I can see my jugular vein pulsing when I‚Äôm laying down, I‚Äôm scared of heart failure. Even though I‚Äôm only 21 and I even had a clear echo a year ago. Wtf. I know my brain would‚Äôve found a different thing to worry about, but I miss the person I was a few days ago before I noticed this stupid vein.
The last time I had my physical was two years ago. It‚Äôs time for me to do another one real soon, and it‚Äôs giving me crazy anxiety. I‚Äôm not worried about the blood taking part but I always struggle when it comes to waiting for the results. It‚Äôs draining me mentally. My previous test results were all normal though, so I am praying real hard it will all be normal too this time around.
I have an IBD, but still can‚Äôt get it out of my head that something else might be going on in my gut and it‚Äôs making me tense and very anxious.
laid down to sleep around 2 hours ago and I have been feeling fluttering on the inside of my body ever since. As if my heart was beating really fast but when I check my heart it's normal"
Yours Truly rant,25,bookofthemonthclub,"Did we read the same book? üòÜ I really enjoyed this one! The characters felt so real and I appreciated the problems they worked through. I also really loved the chemistry between Briana and Jacob! 

I‚Äôm sorry this one wasn‚Äôt for you. Maybe another Abby Jimenez will be!
I really enjoyed both Yours Truly and Just for the Summer. To each their own.
I didn‚Äôt completely hate this book but it didn‚Äôt live up to the hype for me, although I did really enjoy Just for the Summer. 

I did have to LOL at the mention of her Nadia‚Äôs Cupcakes plugs that are present in all her books I‚Äôve read because as somebody who lives in one of the towns that has her bakery, it‚Äôs not really that good IMO and nobody around here really talks about going there ü´£
I really enjoyed Yours Truly. It‚Äôs not as surprisingly deep as Helen Hoang‚Äôs romances feel to me, but I still liked it a lot. 

Jacob‚Äôs internal monologue about his anxiety was written in a way that felt so much like my own that I am literally asking my husband to read it to get a glimpse inside my head. Mine presents a bit differently to the world, but his thoughts/rational felt so familiar. 

I‚Äôve also been through a miscarriage and I know first hand how it can screw you up and mess with your perception of others. Learning that Brianna went through that without the support of her then husband made me forgive some of her communication issues. I could not imagine going through that without the love and support of my husband. I think that explained at least some of her trust issues. 

I wonder if the reason some on this thread have been defensive about it might be that they saw themselves in the parts of the book that you saw as ‚Äúcartoonish‚Äù. As someone who constantly struggles with worrying that they are overreacting to the world and wondering why they can‚Äôt handle certain stimuli as easily as most others seem to do, that was the part of your post that hit me the hardest. Obviously, I‚Äôm sure that wasn‚Äôt your intention, but just providing some potential insight. 


On the other hand, I also find her advertisements for her own bakery very silly and unnecessary. They don‚Äôt really take that much away from the book, but they certainly don‚Äôt add anything

Please god help me with our work email system,23,it,"It says to contact support at dreamhost. Gl
Is this to just one domain or many? Have checked that your email host is not a blacklist.

It could be that the address you are sending from is on a black list.
Edit since I re-read the post and saw that you are not the IT person, Idk why I read the opposite.  
  
I would have your IT guy check if everything is configured correctly, but it looks like somebody blocked your address on their end.

Tipically error 550 happens when:  
- the recipient address is not correct.  
- your email system is blocking your mailbox  
- your email has been marked as spam and blocked on the receiver's email system.

It could be a lot of other things too, but without more details (that you shouldn't post here) it'll be hard to tell where the issue lies
Visit this website and punch in your ""workplace.org"" to see if you're coming up on any block-lists.

Unfortunately, it sounds like you're using a shared mailserver where someone else caused your server to get blocked, and getting de-listed could be a hassle.
