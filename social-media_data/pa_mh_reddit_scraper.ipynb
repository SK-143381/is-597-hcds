And if it\\'s something in between you\\'ve opened the door of communication.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSo I think you need to decide what you want the solution to be, and then ask if she is willing to work with you to get there.\\xa0\\nDid you say ‚ÄúI want to move to XYZ and be closer to my family‚Äù\\n\\nIf she says no you decide if you can live with that or not\\n\\n\\nAnd kids of your own??

If this is not something she agreed to do one day, I think it makes sense that she might not be ready to make the move ASAP. That being said, maybe you need to tell her this is really important to you, and make it clear you need her to consider the possibility. Someone mentioned couples counseling, and I think that\\'s a great idea.\\n\\n\\nI get her having complicated feelings about family. As someone who has had my own struggles and has a partner with a tight knit family, I doubt she doesn\\'t \"get\" it. I\\'m guessing it might bring up difficult feelings for her. It\\'s painful to be faced with the love and support that you never received. But as your partner she should also want what\\'s best for you... And hopefully she can work through these challenges in therapy.\\n\\n\\nCanada is a bit of a shit show. I don\\'t know where exactly you want to move - I\\'m sure the situation varies province to province, but cost of living is crazy, housing is unaffordable and healthcare is a mess. She would be lucky to find a family doctor, let alone the mental health supports she needs. I would really consider this aspect of things - consider what she needs and see if you can make a plan. Can you pay privately for therapy? Are there psychiatrists you can get her referred to? Consider what supports she\\'s receiving and whether you are able to access these supports in the community you are planning to move to.\\nThis might be something to go to couples counseling about, since previous attempts to communicate about it seem to be her not taking it as seriously as you do. I agree with others, I don‚Äôt like that sometimes it ends with her getting comfort from you but I think a third party could help change the dynamic and help you get more to the root of the issue.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0I relate to this a lot. I also moved away from my family‚Äînot as far as I used to live but at one point my goal was just to get far away because that‚Äôs what I needed for my independence. I don‚Äôt regret that at all but I also dated someone with few family connections, and realised I was thinking my idea of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to be close to my family‚Äù was me comparing myself to people I grew up with who now live next door to their parents. I have zero desire to live in my hometown, but I DO value those relationships a lot and I am glad I live closer now that my parents are also getting older. Anyway, back to my ex. This wasn‚Äôt a factor in our breakup, but sometimes it felt like they just didn‚Äôt comprehend why I would want to see my parents and childhood friends so often, why my parents would help me out with stuff (and vice versa), or even why I was talking to my parents about stuff in my daily life (they would think it‚Äôs none of my parents‚Äô business bc THEIR parents didn‚Äôt care). It was like, I don‚Äôt need you to be BFFs with everyone else in my life, but we couldn‚Äôt even cross over the bridge of them understanding why I even had those relationships in the first place. And I wanted them to care a little more, like maybe remembering my family members‚Äô names after years of dating. Anyway, it was just an ongoing low level frustration that I didn‚Äôt really register I was dealing with until after our breakup. Again, this isn‚Äôt why we broke up and things were improving in some aspects so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily something I would‚Äôve broken up about either, more like almost a cultural difference that I think we could‚Äôve put more effort into addressing‚Ä¶ and honestly something I‚Äôll be looking to avoid in my next relationship.\\xa0\\n>Every time I see them, they\\'re a little older.

That\\'s pretty uncomfortable for a LOT of reasons.  \\n\\n  \\nI would try and create some boundaries and see if he can respect them. \"Paul if we are sharing time together I want to be able to be partners. I don\\'t need to make out with you in front of Kate but I need it to feel comfortable to hold hands, hug or talk to each other. If that isn\\'t something we can do I want to limit my time around Kate. You say you want more time with me but then plan our time together in ways that means we don\\'t actually get that time together.\"\\n\\n  \\nI have my doubts about Paul\\'s ability to hinge with respect and care. That\\'s some pretty yucky treatment and some really bad listening.\\nTake your calendar for October and put all your work/school/commitment things on it.\\n\\nNext put your self care time on there.  Gym.  Yoga.  Alone time.  SLEEP.  Time for friends if that fills your cup.  For me baths would figure heavily.  And face masks!  And Indian take out.  Zero responsibility time.  Whatever makes you feel you have more energy not less.  \\n\\nThen see when you can have dates.  You can, perhaps, slightly prioritize Paul in date time since you live with John.  Slightly.  But tell him flat out babe I don‚Äôt have enough time in my life to waste time hanging out with Kate‚Äôs husband more than once a month.  I will do one thing like that as a group with you IF you agree to hold my hand and act like my boyfriend for some of that time.  If not I won‚Äôt do anything like that.  I‚Äôm happy to only have one on one dates.  \\n\\nI‚Äôm not open to being pressured about seeing you more.  I‚Äôm agreeing to things I can‚Äôt really do and you‚Äôre calling me a flake for cancelling.  Let‚Äôs solve that now.  I‚Äôm only agreeing to what‚Äôs on the calendar.  I‚Äôm committed to poly but I‚Äôm not going to keep proving it to you.  \\n\\nThen tell John I have X slots for scheduled dates with you (ideally this is once a week or more).  We may well get bonus time because we live together but I am only promising this.  Everything else is gravy.  Don‚Äôt keep asking me for more, I don‚Äôt have it and I can‚Äôt be all things to you.  This is poly.  That‚Äôs reality.\\n\\nKeep it all on a calendar.  Cancel things for your own benefit if you must but not for one of them at the expense of the other barring emergency.  \\n\\nJohn likely needs to be dating other people or spending more time with his friends or hobbies.  Up to him but it‚Äôs NEVER going to be like monogamy.\\nI know you love them, I don\\'t want to jump straight to dumping both of them, but these men are not treating you well or with respect. They\\'re entitled & demanding, & Paul is self-centered & manipulative as well. I believe in supporting your partners emotionally, but at a certain point, if he\\'s still not showing improvement, it\\'s not your job to convince him you won\\'t leave him for monogamy, & it\\'s his job to figure out how to self-soothe. All you can do is continue to be polyamorous. \\n\\nYou say you suspect Paul isn\\'t doing a good enough job of reassuring Kate, & that\\'s why she\\'s insecure & hostile towards you. But you\\'ve done more than enough to reassure Paul, yet he\\'s still insecure & demanding. It\\'s totally possible he\\'s not a good partner to her & doesn\\'t make her feel secure, especially since he seems pretty self-absorbed, but she might just be stuck on processing her own feelings of jealousy, & a partner can\\'t always do something to help with that. It sounds to me like she might not actually want polyamory (or at least she doesn\\'t want to share).\\n\\nYou\\'ve gotten some great advice so far; setting up a calendar, setting boundaries, & limiting the number of dates you have with both men so you can see friends & date yourself. At the rate you\\'re going, you *will* burn out. Be proactive about conserving & rebuilding your resources now, before it\\'s too late. **It\\'s a clich√©, but you can\\'t pour from an empty cup. The best way to love these men is to love yourself more.**\\n\\nAlso, to second what others have said, please tell Paul that you won\\'t be manipulated into spending time with Kate again unless you can exchange basic restaurant-appropriate PDA with him. If he can\\'t give you that, fine; you won\\'t spend time as a group. God, the way he attempts to manipulate you makes my blood boil. I hope it\\'s a one-off & he doesn\\'t regularly try to alter your behavior with vague criticisms\\n\"Kate\\'s behavior is making me uncomfortable. I will not intentionally put myself in situations where I am uncomfortable, so I will no longer be spending time with Kate.\" Boundary set, ad you\\'re done. And if there\\'s excuses made, like \"you\\'ll miss out on the experience, the fun, etc \" the response is \"this is my decision it\\'s not up for debate.\"  Boundaries are non-negotiable. Not up for discussion. You can explain if you choose, but no is a complete sentence \\n\\nImalso, if your partner cannot accept a boundary as simple as this one and continues to try and force KTP, run. No person is worth constant boundary violations.'},\n",

I was actually just talking to him about that. He hates his parents and doesn\\'t trust them with his issues, and quite frankly, I wouldn\\'t either, they aren\\'t the most supportive. When I asked him why he wouldn\\'t go to counseling, he told me that it\\'s because \"he doesn\\'t need to get better; They either drug the shit out of you, or send you to the loon box\". Having been sent to the \"loon box\" myself, I told him counselors can\\'t prescribe medication or put you in a place unless they have reason to believe you may be a danger to yourself or others, something in which he is not. \\n\\nHe also told me that he doesn\\'t want to change because he\\'s \"rationalized\" his problems, and that it\\'s \"not fun so why would I want to do it\". His rationalizations seem to contradict themselves every few sentences, and fundamentally he doesn\\'t see that his problems are genuinely a danger to his well-being, quite literally physically with his heart rate issues. \\n\\nAnother thing about the girl and him, I\\'m not saying they aren\\'t deserving of love, but she\\'s definitely not the type you\\'d want to date. Like I said she has a very long list of mental problems, and there\\'s usually an episode with her every week or so, it can include extreme emotional episodes or dangerous suicidal urges, and that is just not healthy for someone to be in a relationship with, I and several other of my friends have been in that situation, and it was unhealthy for both sides involved every time. \\n\\n\\nI\\'m probably jumping to conclusions too quick, but im terrified to see how this might affect him given how he\\'s taken situations like this previously rather poorly. \\n\\nIt\\'s tearing me apart inside right now because I feel like I\\'m being too much of a nag and that I might not be doing the right thing, or that I\\'m doing it in the wrong way and doing the wrong things.

You can‚Äôt just switch off that desire to give them love and attention, and receive their love and attention, so suddenly. My ex had stopped loving me but pretended to for about a month. When we broke up she jumped to another guy immediately. I still hung around for a month, as I was not ready to let go yet, but I recently broke off all contact finally. It‚Äôs devastating to lose someone you‚Äôve known and loved for years in just one short month.\\nI'm 5 months out of a 7 year relationship, and it's been really hard. I still live with my ex too. Feels like I'll never find someone who loves me again. I wish he did. I am right where you were, like he's upset, lashing out at me and everything, but why can't we just live in peace and harmony? I was so stupid to think that that could just happen. I'm not ready to let go, and I know that. It's been super hard for me.\\xa0\\ni always read such quotes and messages->revalidate my actions/feelings->decide not to care anymore and move on BUT THEN I FORGET all this and start caring/try to talk to them againüò≠üò≠üò≠\\nwhat do i do HELPPPP i always forget the bad things/bad qualities about them and try to understand and love them and forgive them\\nThank you for this. I'm 2 months out of a 4 year relationship where I was the one loving enough for both of us. The quote you shared really resonates because I begged for less than the bare minimum and only received abuse. That forced relationship didn't last. I'm realizing now that this person never cared for or loved me at all. I was convenient to him. Although that hurts quite a bit, I now know I deserve so much more. I deserve to be built up, not broken down. The more I look back at everything, the more I realize how horrible he really was, and now I was spared when he broke up with me. Knowing now who he truly is, I can move forward without regrets. I tried my best and all the issues lie with him. \\n\\nI'm also moving next week! I've been staying in the house we bought together (he moved out because he got with the girl he cheated on me with and couldn't bring her to our house with me there). It's exciting and terrifying but it's a huge step forward for me.\"},\n",

Whether that\\'s through a therapist, self-help, etc.\\nI understand how hard it is to be around someone suffering from anxiety that way. I would recommend couple\\'s counseling and also that she needs to deal with her anxiety in a way that works for her, hopefully she would be open to therapy. It\\'s okay to set boundaries and say no to when she\\'s taking out her stress on you. Sometimes people are in denial about their behaviours and it takes repeated pointing out for them to see that they are in fact, behaving in unfair ways. Take care of yourself, and I wish you both the best.\\nShe needs to deal with her massive anxiety issues- it must be exhausting to exist in a constant state of panic and stress about things that aren\\'t actually problems. It\\'s also kind of insulting to hear your salaries and know that she is still constantly complaining about money and stressing out- so many people including myself make so much less than her and have actual real things to stress about! But anyway, if she won\\'t deal with this in therapy/ with medication and by taking it seriously, then you should seriously consider leaving. People have to treat their own mental health issues, so there\\'s nothing you can do in this situation.\\nRight now, you\\'re lighting yourself on fire, just to keep her warm.\\n\\nShe\\'s not doing any work to change this.\\n\\nIf I were you, I\\'d be planning my exit from this relationship.\\nThis is crazy bc I had almost the exact same thing. She (kind, funny, gorgeous, all the things) would turn absolutely everything into an ordeal, far beyond anxiety into Truman Show territory. Things that happen around us always seemed to happen to her. And when she took a vacation, I noticed I suddenly felt much more relaxed. Similar to your situation, we didn\\'t fight or argue. It was the World vs Her.\\n\\n\\nA small example. We have a two-way stop (east/west doesn\\'t stop, north/south does) in our neighborhood. Most people think it\\'s a four-way stop because there\\'s a roundabout. I usually drove, but one day she decided to. The opposing car (no stop) stopped at the roundabout and my gf SCREAMED at her, at the top of her lungs. I said \"just wait, she\\'s dumb, drivers here are dumb.\"\\n\\n\\nThis resulted in accusations of me \"taking her (other driver\\'s) side\" and ended up ruining whatever we were doing. This was a five second interaction that ended up setting the tone for the rest of the weekend.\\n\\n\\nAdopts animals, then freaks out because there\\'s hair everywhere. Asks for busy shifts then comes home saying she hates people and wants to quit her job. Etc. If I suggest something basic or logical, usually \"slow down and know your limits, you\\'re human,\" I am just like everyone else. So the option is to either play into her stress, or stand by helpless.\\n\\n\\nYour gf getting therapy could save your relationship, as others have suggested. Don\\'t feel guilty. You\\'re not supposed to be in panic mode all the time.\\n\\n\\nI broke things off with mine after the last straw, it was something small like calling me dumb for not reading her mind, but it was the 100000th cut. She thought therapy was a scam.\\n\\n\\nBumped into her a bit ago and it\\'s baffling how well we get along now that I\\'m not her bf (we\\'re not hooking up, just being small town civil). People like this tend to be codependent, to the point that they make independent people feel guilty for not participating.\\xa0'},\n",

       "  'comments': 'I‚Äôm just going to float a controversial opinion here:\\n\\nThe reason women are struggling with dating so much is because men have not progressed at the same rate as us. Think about it: for generations, we‚Äôve had to marry to just ‚Äúget by‚Äù in life. It wasn‚Äôt so long ago that we couldn‚Äôt work, vote, choose our life etc etc. Even in our parents and grandparents generations the norm was to quickly marry out of high school and start popping out kids - sure there are outliers who chose to also have a career or travel but they‚Äôre far less common than they are now. Throughout all of this, we‚Äôve had to be the emotional caretaker of our relationships - remember this, it‚Äôs important. It‚Äôs our ‚Äújob‚Äù to ‚Äútake care‚Äù of the man and the house and our well-being and appearance. \\n\\nCut to present: really over the last two generations we‚Äôve seen a complete shift in the way women are choosing to live. More of us than ever are choosing a childfree life, choosing a career, choosing to travel. We can have all those things now without being ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù. Women have had to build strength and independence rapidly to adapt and enjoy all these freedoms we can now have without judgement. But we still have the emotional and mental strength of earlier generations imparted in us. Essentially what that means is we now have several generations of women who are mentally and emotionally strong, smart, driven, independent, and able to make their own choices in life. \\n\\nOn the flip side, men have been sort of blindsided with this development and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear to me that they don‚Äôt know how/are unable to adapt to this new generation of women. The overwhelming majority of men still have ingrained patriarchal views, lack of emotional intelligence (because they‚Äôve been raised to expect a woman to take care of them), a hugely problematic tendency to sexualise and objectify us, and an overall total lack of ability to relate to and celebrate the monumental shift women have been able to achieve in recent generations. I think many quietly hate that we no longer ‚Äúneed‚Äù them. \\n\\n*I do have to make the obligatory ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù statement as there are plenty out there who love the fact that it‚Äôs a new world for us and we are considerably less oppressed. I also have to include ‚Äúnot all women‚Äù as sadly there are so many countries/cultures where we are still denied freedom and basic rights. I‚Äôm generalising here*\\n\\nOverall, I find it rare to meet men where there are not issues with boundaries, consent, objectification, and the expectation of emotional caretaking. \\n\\nI can only hope that in time, men finally start to understand that the old ways of relating to women are not acceptable anymore. When they fully embrace a more equal mindset towards relationships then I believe we will have an easier time in dating.\\nAre you are me üòÇ 34 and have not had any type of relationship last for more than a few months over the past 4.5 years. It feels like one big cosmic joke sometimes. I have my sh*t together financially, physically and my mental health is pretty great recently. \\n\\nEveryday I‚Äôm actively working on bettering myself in some way. I‚Äôve done online dating but quit at the start of this year and have been focusing on real life meetups. I‚Äôm at the gym five days week. I taught myself to cook good, healthy food. I spend time with my friends and family. I‚Äôve joined a meetup group. I‚Äôve taken up more hobbies. I‚Äôve said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to social gatherings I‚Äôd usually blow off etc. the list goes on. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt get interest from guys but the ones who do show interest seemingly have heaps of issues they need to sort out (mental health, financial stuff, kids with exes). \\n\\nIt almost feels like the more I work on myself/improve my life the more glaringly obvious it is that so many haven‚Äôt done that same work. It‚Äôs exhausting. I know nobody‚Äôs perfect but wow do some people choose not to work on bettering themselves. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt have any advice other than I FEEL YOU. Tbh I think a lot of dating and finding that one person is pure luck and circumstance.\\nI read this on the happy and single subreddit, but someone said \"dating is not a reward.\" And it\\'s SO true.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLike truly you can max out every aspect of your life, and there won\\'t be some golden man waiting there as a trophy for you. People find their partners at many random points in their lives. Broken unhealthy people can find relationships. I used to think like you and I would beat myself up over what I was \"doing wrong\". But sometimes the answer is literally - nothing. Luck and timing attributes to 99% of the process. Just keep on enjoying your life in the mean time!\\nMy theory is that with each life improvement you make, you are setting yourself up for disappointment when you meet a person who has not taken the steps to actually improve their lives.  I have definitely been on the receiving end of interested people and dates, but I would turn them around because they were not the right person.  Is it bad luck or are you just more selective?  And do you really want to lower your standards?\\nSounds like you live somewhere that you\\'re not a good fit for. The biggest game changer I ever experienced was moving to a city where I fit in really well. I would absolutely recommend that to anyone in your situation.'},\n",

A game can be \\'not feminist\\' due to situations outside of the game\\'s control (such as having a sexist dev or CEO), but to be considered \\'feminist\\' it has to exclusively deal with what OP considers to be \\'feminist topics\\'. That\\'s double standards. Also, I don\\'t think something is or isn\\'t feminist purely based on whether it handles topics of womanhood very specifically. \\n\\nWhat about female creations, or in Hades\\' case, art specifically drawn by women, in a story where LGBTQ+ themes are strong and respectful. By this logic, a show like Arcane cannot be feminist because the studio that made it or the community that plays the game is full of degenerates. I also think deciding that Bayonetta is decidedly not feminist, when its main character is a strong and independent woman with her own agency, motivations and sexual expression, but papers please be neutral is...a take for sure. This links back into my earlier point too. If Bayonetta cannot be feminist because according to you she\\'s been designed with the \\'male gaze\\' in mind, then why is Hades not feminist for having been designed by women to be sexy for a more feminine audience? What are we supposing feminism means here?\\nThat\\'s a LOT of work y\\'all have done and I\\'m surprised you didn\\'t run out of space! \\n\\nHowever I would consider embedding the list of games as an image. As that\\'s a lot of lines / hard work just to get messed up by Reddit\\'s poor formatting system.\\nWait how is Elden Ring not at least neutral? If Bloodborne is, I assume the management isn\\'t an issue. \\n\\nIt has a bunch of female characters who are as powerful as male characters, central to story lines, and gender neutral outfits that don\\'t change much by body type for player characters. I was so happy with the game and the ability to wear full coverage armour. You can wear clothes collected from beings of any gender.\\n\\nThere are a lot of female characters, Melina, Roderika, Latenna, Ranni, Malenia, Marika, Cleanrot knights, Blackknife assassins, Millicent, Nepheli, Fia, Hyetta, Irina, the crones etc. plus even more with the extra content now. I\\'d say at least 50/50 representation. \\n\\nAll the characters have distinct motivations, and abilities, as well as styles of dress, there\\'s even disability representation. Multiple characters with prosthesis for example, and characters who are blind but still independent. It plays into the world building, but like Malenia\\'s prosthesis are really detailed, effort was clearly put into design. I don\\'t think they\\'re stereotypical since some are \"villains\", and others are not. They exist on a spectrum of identities.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t a traditional romancing aspect to the game, but female characters can choose the Ranni ending which involves sort of being her partner. Characters gender doesn\\'t explicitly change anything in the story. \\n\\nThere are a lot of themes that tie into social issues. Complex political situations, wars, family, racism. It\\'s just in a fantasy setting, but you can see commonalities with real world issues like the Holocaust, and general themes of discrimination. \\n\\nIt\\'s a very good game, and I found the community was good too.\\n\\nEdit to add: \\n\\nYou have the option to help stop a man who is perpetrating harm against women and men in the game. To not do so would be seen clearly as a negative. There are pretty clear moral \"dilemmas\" raised in the game. You\\'re made to feel bad if you choose bad options.\\nas much as i love the effort in this. its way too hard to read :('},\n",

Really seems to give \"rules for thee, but not for me\" and \"You will own nothing and be happy\" vibes while using environmental \"concerns\" as an excuse.\\nYou see the left were very smart. I feel for it at first too but when looking back I found a pattern.\\n\\nThe thing is the slippery slope is real and the left has mastered it. They start off with small things that everyone can agree on that have an emotional appeal. Once it becomes mainstream accepted they start the process of using it as a wedge to divide the political opponents from those they want to control. They do it slowly with things that make sense and have emotional appeal. Then they ramp up making opponents into something truly evil overtime while holding themselves up as the saviors and hero\\'s. While they are doing that they add in little things that people don\\'t always agree with but the small steps make people not question it because they don\\'t want to be part of the evil side. Eventually, they push it so far people are agreeing with and pushing for things they would never agree with:\\n\\nExamples - Clinton on abortion: safe, legal, and, rare. The majority agree in extremely rare cases (rape, incest, life of mother) it should be accepted and that it should be as safe as possible. Safe, legal, and rare became safe, legal, and limited. The right raised flags saying they are moving the goal posts, the left says they are trying to force rape victims to carry babies. Then safe, legal, and limited became safe, legal, and choice. The left started removing the limitation to abortion and again the right raised flags. The right was alienated as hands maid tale and those that started to question it was now anti-choice. Now it\\'s safe and a right... creating laws to allow for abortion up to birth and some on the left even arguing post birth and if you don\\'t agree you are after women\\'s bodies and fascists.\\n\\nYou can do the same with climate change, the alphabet mafia, free speech, and illegal immigration. It\\'s a tried and true technic that takes decades to enact but have tricked many into believing they are the morally good, which allows them to commit acts just years previously they would find horrendous. The worst part is they use your own sense of right and wrong to do it with via emotional manipulation.\\nTheir proposed climate change policies are abysmal too.

For that alone, I applaud you!!!\\n\\nThere is no rule that says you have to declutter. If you're not ready to, that's ok. With the work you're putting in, you might find yourself more able to let things go a little later down the line. It's great that you have an awareness that you'll never be able to get through it all. Enjoy your makeup in whatever capacity you choose to, and I hope you can continue to find fulfilment and creativity in the hobby of using, rather than buying, makeup. Best of luck!\\nI‚Äôm very sorry to hear how hard of a time you‚Äôve been having. I really hope you and your family are doing better and continue to do so!\\n\\nAs for advice, I have a couple suggestions:\\n\\n1. Try making it exciting to do your makeup daily by:\\n- making it into a game: randomly/blindly choose different products each day and challenge yourself to combine them into a cohesive look\\n- try some YouTube makeup challenges or have your friends choose your makeup for the day \\n- you seem to have a lot of lip products, maybe you can put them in a box and reach in and grab one at random. That can be your daily lip product. \\n\\n2. This one is less ‚Äúproductive‚Äù but can possibly help with your overwhelming anxiety and guilt:\\n- store away your products and only have a small collection of essentials for a month. (This is hard, but in the end will help you realize that you don‚Äôt need a lot of products and will help prevent you from relapsing, trust me I‚Äôve been there) out of sight out of mind \\n- you can rotate products each month (maybe a month can have a theme or something) \\n- it‚Äôs kind of like shopping your collection. At the end of each month you‚Äôll be able to go back to your collection and choose new products for the next month. \\n\\n3. Finally, I understand how difficult it is to get rid of products. I find that when I‚Äôm decluttering I want to keep everything because I consider it all special. You can take away that specialness by simplifying the product:\\n- it‚Äôs a blush. You most likely have another product that looks and works the same. You don‚Äôt need multiple of one product. In fact most blushes end up looking the same, there‚Äôs only so much our skin and undertones can do\\n- as for eyeshadow, ask yourself what colors you actually like and which ones are you forcing yourself to like. \\n- In general, if you have even the slightest doubt of a product, get rid of it! You should only keep what you love and makes you happy! Imagine you‚Äôre going to marry that product lol! Don‚Äôt have doubts! \\n- I find it easier to donate products to family and friends. It sits easier with me knowing that it‚Äôs going to a good place and can make someone else happy instead of just going to the trash. \\n- I think Sephora has a somewhat lenient return policy. Maybe you could return some of the unused products?\\n\\nPlease please don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. You are human and deserve to have peace in your life. ü§ç\\nI think you are on the right path, don't be too hard on yourself. Makeup is something you love, don't make it stressful by worrying about the size of your collection. It's great that you've recognised the issue, now you can work on it. But be gentle with yourself and don't beat yourself up about it. You can change your attitude now and work on your mental health, but don't be so harsh.\\nI think that if you aren‚Äôt ready to commit to downsizing, that‚Äôs okay! But something I would say is that it might be better for you to try and get away from the mindset of ‚ÄúWell this caught my eye for a reason.‚Äù You know the reason. You were coping with a difficult period of your life by trying to get a dopamine hit from shopping. Now, maybe there are some things you genuinely were into and that you would want to use, but I know from my own experiences treating shopping in a very similar way, a lot of the things that I was drawn to, I wanted because I envisioned a version of me who owned that product and felt differently than I felt in my own reality. \\n\\nInstead of trying to decide if you‚Äôre going to get rid of a ton of stuff or try to test it all out, for now, maybe just try to use stuff that appeals to you when it appeals to you. Maybe pick out a handful of products from each category- some that you have tried and like and some that are new, and box up the rest. Shop your collection and rotate things out when you feel bored or you feel the impulse to shop. Maybe twice a year go through the unused stuff and decide if there are any things you‚Äôre absolutely not going to use and then go through the stuff you‚Äôve tried out and decide if there are things that need another try or if you would be better off without.\\nA lot of us relate fully to this, including myself. Before my first massive declutter last year where I threw out literally 2 medium sized cardboard boxes full of my expired 2015-2018 makeup, my collection was similar to yours. I think a lot of factors contribute to it - one major one being influencers calling it a makeup ‚Äúcollection‚Äù. The way that term is now used by the beauty community makes it look exciting and normal for makeup lovers to own drawers and drawers of products. You start feeling compelled to take advantage of every big sale. You feel fomo if you don‚Äôt own whatever viral thing every other girl is obsessed with at the moment. Curating the ‚Äúcollection‚Äù becomes the real hobby. It usually take a few years until we start seeing it in a different light - overconsumption of hundreds of tiny products that will take motivation and time weekly to apply, organize and sanitize until empty, broken or expired. \\n\\nAs a former Sephora employee who had a massive collection after working there, a big way I downsize my backup stash of unopened product without feeling guilty is filling the unused cosmetic bags I accumulated (from brand events or as free gifts with purchase) with a whole face routine of full sized products to give as gifts for family and friends for holidays and birthdays. Like a full size mascara, eyeliner, loose powder, blush, bronzer, highlighter, eyeshadow or palette, and a lipstick. My SIL and mom especially love it and it makes me feel so good to know the products are being enjoyed by my loved ones instead of rotting for years in a spare drawer until I get around to opening them. That‚Äôs totally an option though and don‚Äôt feel guilty if you want to keep and enjoy most of your products for you. Every piece we own is special to us for some reason so only give away the things you like but you know you can live without.\"},\n",

       "  'comments': 'I don\\'t have an answer for you, but I certainly appreciated hearing your thoughts about one of my favorite written and portrayed characters in TV.\\nI think textbook pessimism as a lived philosophy is kinda of fundamentally inhuman, and very hard to hold onto without becoming a hermit\\nI can only respond in the vein of realism because the show really is a masterclass in that.\\n\\nTLDR: The guy needed to get help (some form of grief therapy) when his daughter died. He needed some form of trauma therapy (not just a stay at a psychiatrist facility for a few months) after he was done working YEARS undercover in insane circumstances. He had a substance problem that he was NOT succeeding to regulate (as was Marty), and had an insomnia problem that he sought to treat by purchasing street drugs from a hooker - NOT going to a doctor for help (I mean why the fuck would anyone do that). And he never got ANY help for his hallucinations? All of that and not mentioning his childhood (raised in remote circumstances to a survivalist kook in Alaska without access to television or his mother?).\\n\\nLook at these things this way, and frankly I\\'d be with Gilbough and Papania. Dude\\'s a great suspect, especially when you see him getting hammered in the middle of the day (pilot script and treatment originally having this be a ruse to pretend to be impaired mentally) and admits he doesn\\'t sleep and hallucinates. I mean jfc, guy\\'s a wreck.\\n\\nLonger version: neglected in childhood, faces the loss of his daughter and his wife, gets no counseling, takes out his rage at work (working the local drug circuit to death til they were in hotel rooms busting people for very small amounts of cocaine, then murders a junkie on the job), then becomes a wild undercover agent for years in high-stress and drug-fueled environments before becoming a detective at the start of E1.\\n\\nSomeone with that background needs so much help that the last time I watched TDS1 (my favorite \"filmed thing\" EVER) I had to actually shelve it when I was done -- to face that many things and just try to champ them all without any professional help and then wear a gun on your hip ever day is insanely negligent. I realized how much I really idolized the character for the machismo.\\n\\nHis philosophies kept him isolated, and his contempt for other people only serves to cast himself as better and/or smarter (conscious or not) of whoever he\\'s talking about. He\\'s ironically more self-righteous than others, though he never says it, deflecting by saying things like \"everyone is no one\" - kind of a massive difference from saying something healthy like \"I\\'m not better than anyone - everyone is equal.\"\\n\\nThe show is great, but Rust became a hell of a lot less likable to me as I got older. On the other side of that, yeah I kinda get annoyed with the tough guy attitude.\\n\\nSo, middlepath? Fuck yeah. If he would\\'ve gotten help with like 1 or 2 of those things he wouldn\\'t be the same level of edgelord and wouldn\\'t have had the same difficulty keeping a job, making friends, currying favor, and possibly pursuing the central case with more legitimacy. But this isn\\'t just a show about the case - it\\'s a show about the 2 guys and their lives, and the case, too.\\n\\n(sorry for deflecting all the philosophies - I just think most of all that stuff was bullshit fodder to meet his own ends of staying on his own)\\n\\nEDIT: I forgot to mention at the top that he fuckin hallucinates because of all the drugs and stress he endured, lmao\\nMy personal take is that pessimism is a cold and miserable philosophy and, in a traumatic near-death situation like Rust faced in the end, he desperately needed some kind of human warmth, even if it is bullshit. Basically almost dying broke down all his coping mechanisms and all the walls he had built around himself and forced him to connect with humanity because deep down we\\'re all terrified of being alone. It\\'s like the \"no atheists in a foxhole\" type thing, not that god is real but humans actually terrified for their lives are gonna grab anything comforting they can.\\nHe was abandoned and neglected by his parents and had his daughter torn away from him and his marriage disintegrate. His boo-sucks-to-life philosophy is a means of protecting himself. He needs to accept his daughter\\'s death was a bad thing, and to grieve it.\\n\\nPhilosophically, he needs to get with some sort of Pragmatism and stop chasing the Absolutist ether, and to reject his default to negativity.\\n\\n\"Come down off the cross, we can use the wood\" - Tom Waits.\\n\\nWhat he really needs is what we all need - to work and to love. By \\'work\\' I don\\'t mean emplyment, I mean to feel useful. \\n\\nI think the shift at the end is because he accepts he was loved by his daughter and his father. He couldn\\'t hold his defenses, and he accepted what he knew - what had driven him to reject life.\\n\\nThe final shot is of Rust finally, literally leaning on someone - Marty.\\nThe middle ground is ‚Äúcuriosity.‚Äù \\n\\nThe universe is absent of meaning. But as a member of our species, we need meaning to survive. Similar to how any living organism needs to find sustenance to survive, human beings NEED meaning. It is fundamental to our individual and collective survival. \\n\\nNow, that meaning can come from a cultural blueprint (like religion) or it can be established by the individual search. \\n\\nThis ‚Äúsearch‚Äù for meaning is curiosity. It takes intellectual humility to recognize how little we know of the universe (only the ignorant live in certainty). But in that lack of certainty lives hope. And with hope, comes the search.'},\n",

Trained professionals can see deeper than what most people can see. I was so skeptical myself and said it probably a dozen times or more over the course of our interviews of how I just didn\\'t know if autism is even what I was dealing with and that I only had a suspicion.\\n\\nSide note: She also said I had a \"unique and interesting\" way of perceiving the world.\\nThank you for sharing your experience! I‚Äôm also a diagnosed AFAB adult, and the part about your doctor seeing how you perceive and interact with the world being different than others was something that happened to me, too.\\n\\nI also wonder if some of the issues regarding misinterpreting doctors‚Äô dismissals is genuinely due to poor explanation by doctors. Like, what does ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt present as autistic‚Äù mean in that context? What hallmarks of their internal experience differ from autism? I think it might genuinely help at least some people if said doctors explained the actual differences they are seeing that don‚Äôt align with autism ‚Äî it might also help rule other diagnoses in that might genuinely be more beneficial to pursue.\\nThank you for sharing! Fellow late-diagnosed, AFAB, \"high-masking\" here who also had a positive experience with getting diagnosed. :) \\n\\nI also share your confusion about female autism being *so* invisible that even well-trained professionals can\\'t detect it... like??? Like you said, assuming these professionals specialise in and up to date with autism, then  I expect they can *still* can spot the subtle signs. Heck, throughout my entire life, *people always saw my symptoms*, but just never linked it to autism. Like just for the example,  even my first psychologist (who didn\\'t specialise in autism or ADHD unfortunately) could tell that my mannerisms seemed robotic, forced... and they wanted to train me in social skills! üòÖ there\\'s more examples but I shan\\'t derail this haha.\\n\\n So the idea that someone can be SO good at masking that absolutely *no one* notices even a *single* symptoms is... suspicious Iol.\\nThank you for sharing, even though I don‚Äôt relate to your story, I appreciated reading it and thank you for sharing.\\ni also had a positive experience with diagnosis as an afab (i identify and present as female). i really dislike this excuse as well. any assessor worth their salt **will** understand genuine masking etc. i had no idea i was autistic at all tbh and it came up whilst i was being assessed for adhd. i was really shaken by this and my point is that the majority of professionals do know what they‚Äôre doing & what to look for. hence why they pick things up. it‚Äôs so much more than a tick box exercise. i agree though it would be really good if professionals were able to try and explain this better, because otherwise people just get really mad they didn‚Äôt get diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder (?!?!), shit on the doctor/team, and go for a ‚Äúsecond opinion‚Äù. \\n\\nif you do have autism, regardless of presentation & afab/amab, with a good assessment it IS clockable. this especially weirds me out when people who have spent a lot of time on psych wards aren‚Äôt diagnosed but say they‚Äôre autistic. if you‚Äôre under medical supervision in hospital, where your behaviours etc are constantly watched and tracked, someone WILL pick up on it. i already had the diagnosis before going into hospital but the doctor who hadn‚Äôt read my notes yet wrote it was very obvious i had autism after meeting me & my parents (my dad is also autistic) for 15 mins. it does get spotted. don‚Äôt be scared to get an assessment if you‚Äôre afab/femme presenting !!!'},\n",

Whenever I read people in this and similar subs describe some of these things about their parents and attribute them to narcissism (that‚Äôs just such a cultural touchpoint in the U.S. and in media), I drop a bomb that their parents are likely ND and it‚Äôs always met with silence. \\n\\nOne‚Äôs own PERSONAL journey to diagnosis can be confusing and conflicting, so, it follows that seeing your parent through this lens might be too.\\n\\nNot only can I relate to that moment of shock, BUT, I have specific things I can relate to in your story: my mom is a great singer and would regularly, without fail, sing more loudly than the choir in church. Like, ZERO social awareness. She also overshares SO SO much. I ALSO realize my mom likely has echolalia. It has been a tailspin to have the moment of recognition, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs true. Shrug.\\n\\nFor me, there‚Äôs not much I can do. Years and years of this intertwined relationship that has the potential for strain in solid, NT relationships has exhausted me. I know more and it helps me give her some grace. And that‚Äôs about it.\\n\\nCould chat about how I put the pieces together in my own life, if you‚Äôre open to it!\\n\\nDiagnosis is a lot to process, so it‚Äôs no wonder you‚Äôre thinking about what it means for yourself, and perhaps the places you inherited it from! Your mum could be experiencing neurodivergence too. Have you spoken to her about it? \\n\\nI think I remember a post a while back on the ADHDwomen Reddit where someone asked the group how many of them had a narcissistic parent, and there was quite a high response. \\n\\nI have also read Janette McCurdy‚Äôs ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Glad My Mom Died‚Äô - which was brilliant, and a little bit like you - it really resonated with me and my own upbringing! I have recently been doing some reading into the links between neurodivergence and being raised by narcissistic parents, and I have found it really helpful in understanding my own behaviour, and how I was raised.\\nReading this in fear because my current obsession is trying not to fuck up my kids so they end up hating me, while probably doing just that. If any of you have answers for OP let me know because I feel like my kids have written this from the future.\\nIt's hard to separate trauma symptoms from autism because society as is stands provides no options for raising an autistic child without traumatizing them. \\n\\nThat said a lot of the signs you see in your mom are trauma symptoms including oversharing, shame, and lack of a social network. \\n\\nThe loudness and inability to shut her mouth could be ADHD. The low threshold for injustice and change could be autism. However there's much here that may be pure trauma. \\n\\nBeing physically beat by your entire immediate family and never allowing yourself space to recover or have other loving relationships messes with one's brain as much or more than natural neurodivergence.\\nI know we‚Äôre not supposed to diagnose others or ourselves, but ever since I started doing more reading about neurodivergence and understanding what the symptoms look like, I kind of suspect my whole family has something going on. I definitely see it in my own mother (although she is a lot different from your description of your mother). \\n\\nAnd I honestly kind of think you can easily start to see these patterns in your own family members, and it‚Äôs kind of justified to see it in your parents since it‚Äôs known to to run in families, especially if you have been formally diagnosed yourself. And we now know how it is much more common in women than previously thought. \\n\\nI think it sounds like she has some complex issues though. Like she definitely had a traumatic upbringing but also it sounds like she is definitely autistic. \\n\\nSome of your descriptions sound exactly like my sister. My sister has recently been diagnosed with ADHD- hyperactive and she also believes she is autistic. It makes sense to me because:\\n- she also has the motor-mouth thing going on\\n- she definitely tends to over share and talk about stuff that you shouldn‚Äôt about in public, and she gets defensive if I tell her we‚Äôre not supposed to talk about those things in public. It seems like she has a hard time understanding social contexts\\n- she also has poor spatial awareness and coordination and stomps and slams doors without meaning to, and I don‚Äôt believe this is stimming by the way, as well as dropping things frequently (I also have this issue minus the stomping and slamming doors though)\\n- she also has difficulty with changes (when she was a little kid she would have meltdowns, and I think I did too; they called them temper tantrums back then)\\n- she‚Äôs also super smart (and can come across arrogant at times), I think being told how smart she was as a kid didn‚Äôt help\\n- she‚Äôs also highly anxious (I think it‚Äôs basically a defense mechanism that develops due to repeatedly having getting in trouble for saying or doing the wrong things, and I have this too but to a lesser degree), \\n- she also has the sensory issues with clothes\\n- she also was bullied as a child. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt know if all of these things you listed count as aspects of autism or adhd, like I‚Äôm not sure that being confused about your sexuality is related? I think part of it must be cultural. A lot of older patriarchal cultures have made women feel ashamed for their sexualities and the only way to be a sexual person was if you were trying to get pregnant. \\n\\nI think the shame and self-criticism is an aspect of depression. Honestly, it sounds like she has severe untreated anxiety and depression, and maybe it is partially because of her being different her whole life and the trauma that can cause a person. And it could be related to her religious upbringing or just the way she was treated by her parents, or all of the above. \\n\\nNow I don‚Äôt know how productive it is to give her this label if she isn‚Äôt seeking it herself. But I feel like it can definitely help you understand your own upbringing and relationship with her by viewing it through a different lens.\"},\n",

You can‚Äôt attack her via text and move on for your own sake. First off you resent this woman, that‚Äôs fine. This issue is you‚Äôre trying to get you husband to simply cut off his parents. That‚Äôs not a choice you get to make. You can go NC. You can leave the home for visits, you can grey rock, and not respond. But honestly you can‚Äôt try to force a choice. They are his parents, despite everything he loves them, he wants them in his life. Trying to push an ultimatum is destroying your marriage. Your husband‚Äôs inability to choose is hurting you as well as his inability to fight for you. That is an issue. \\n\\nBut texting a family group chat all of your grievances? That will blow up in your face. You will be the bad guy, and it will look that way. If you feel you absolutely have to I would speak to your husband first. Explain that this build up of hatred is hurting you and your marriage. That you have specific points that you would like to speak with MIL regarding. Set ground rules and arrange a meeting. It probably won‚Äôt go well but at least your issues are out there. Then you and you alone can go NC.\\nIs your counsellor an enmeshment trauma counsellor?\\n\\nThe porn is very very common with enmeshed men. Food addiction is the way most enmeshed women go. The porn addiction is not about you, it started well before you and it's your husband's attempt to emancipate from his mother, but within a relationship, it can cause damage. Ken Adams covers this concept well. Please don't let it impact you, it's not about you although it can feel very personal. \\n\\nDon't bother texting the group chat, they don't care. Just take your child and leave, take your space, go to a hotel and have a holiday and tell your husband when he rings you that he needs to think about what's most important to him, that you won't hold it against him if he chooses his mother, you just want to have the facts and he needs time to decide. Don't overwhelm him with anger or emotion, that's what his mother does. \\n\\nJust be matter of fact and start to look at options for your life. As another person said, you can start taking your child to playgroup on the weekend, you can go away for the weekend, you can book your child into some kind of class, you can stay home when he goes to his mother's. You don't have to do what they say and you can be your own circuit breaker as your husband is clearly unwilling to. Don't wait for someone else to make it OK for you to live your life as you wish. \\n\\nPlease get support and help just for yourself, particularly with the losses and grief you've suffered. Take yourself out of the house with your child to physically limit the contact so you can find yourself again and connect with your child. If your husband comes along for the ride, great, if not, leave him where he is. Best wishes.\\nSo, which is it? Do you want to attack her in group chat, or do you want to move on?\\n Maybe it's time for LO to join a Saturday morning play group. If you are gone before she arrives, no drama in your face. If she wants to wait around, maybe she and her dear baby son can enjoy some quality time together and clean the house.\\nUnless husband is willing to do the hard yards in enmeshment therapy along with couples therapy, then I think you have your answer‚Ä¶..\\n\\nNo point sending messages to a group chat. 2 card your husband and do as you say - 6 years of trying but it‚Äôs too much‚Ä¶..

I don\\'t ever want you to feel like you need to be my therapist.\" I had a full-body reaction to the idea that my mom would ever have the self-awareness that she had turned me into her caretaker. \\n\\nIt\\'s been a slow process of disentangling myself from that enmeshment, but geographical distance (living far away), therapy, and education has really helped. Recently I\\'ve been really impacted by the book \"Discovering Your Inner Mother\" which deals with the concept of the mother wound and re-parenting yourself. It also talks about the way the family system often demands a parentified child stays the way they are, as caretaker, family secretary, and mediator, and resists the child\\'s attempts to change. \\n\\nI think what you\\'re feeling is grief! It makes a lot of sense. I don\\'t think the grief ever fully goes away, but as things start to shift in your life, I really believe you can find more peace and that the heaviness will start to lift.\\nDamn your situation sounds a lot like mine. I see how much love you have for your family. I understand what it‚Äôs like to be the eldest and ‚Äúfirst to complete‚Äù those benchmarks. Now when younger siblings struggle, we are the ones they turn to. \\n\\nI also understand the fear of an enmeshed family ruining your relationship or hope of love. Your partner understands you and loves you. They will not leave you for seeing you cope and manage this unfortunate situation. Your life is for you to live. I believe you making this post is an acknowledgement of that, and I‚Äôm proud of you.\\nI\\'m really sorry. It\\'s very overwhelming to carry so much responsibility before we are ready to do it. It\\'s encouraging to me that you have already redirected things in order to care for yourself, taking a different job and role in your career. How you sound in what you write reminds me of the many grief cycles I\\'ve gone through over the years. Usually during life transitions of some kind; like maturing, next stages of relationships, the age of my kids, stages of education, stages of jobs and career, my health. It was like all the stress and worry would get heavier, and that feeling of crying. But from way down deep and unspecified. I learned it was grieving (denial, anger, bargaining, sadness, acceptance). And those moments were the stage of grieving where you need to cry. I also learned that I needed to do a better job of prioritizing myself as much as I cared for others. I didn\\'t need to care for others less, although that happened as I learned about boundaries, but I did need to care for myself in equal measure. One for one ratio.\\n\\nEducation (like therapy) helped tremendously. Understanding what was going on in my internal world, gaining language to describe and talk about it, learning tools for coping and feeling more in control of my existence all has led to stability and peace. There\\'s still plenty of moments where I struggle, but not remotely to the depth that you speak of. So things do get better. Also, meds. Those are a God send for giving you some stability and peace while you learn how to create that for yourself but haven\\'t quite gotten there yet. Five stars. Haha\\n\\nHang in there. Each tiny change you\\'ll make with the help of your therapist creates a ripple effect that lasts a lifetime. It won\\'t be like right now, forever. There\\'s light at the end of the tunnel.

If/when she gives you permission/it's time to tackle the inside, again start with focusing on safety issues.\\nI really don't think you should secretly photograph your mom's mess, and definitely don't post the pictures online if you do.\\nGo for it!

       "  'comments': 'This is very thought-provoking. Dostoyevsky was less optimistic that man could fully orient himself without God (a higher power in general) and really explores that in *Crime and Punishment* and *Notes from Underground*. Nietzsche believed that man would one day be able to invent good and evil for himself without, for instance, God. He taught that we would essentially have to become gods to ourselves (the Superman). But Dostoy, a devout, yet pessimistic Christian, writes that man is *incapable* of being gods: because we were created to *need* God as creations *of* God.\\nThank you for sharing your thoughts. It offered some interesting perspectives on the utter loneliness of the Nietzschean project.\\nNietzsche quite explicitly calls for Dionysian unity.\\nNietzsche used what was in his time: \"the herd\" was a workforce of mostly poorly educated workers fresh from ignorant farming communities that were often quite insular and deeply tied to the moral authority of the church. It was easy to speak of Marx\\'s \"workers\" in those days and perhaps easier to unify them as a herd. In Russia, this can be observed in the lead up to the revolution -- it\\'s astounding how many peasants stubbornly stuck with the Tsar and genuinely believed him to be an impartial Father-figure. Little did they know that Tsar Nick was an absolute old-school tyrant, etc. etc. Of course, when that spell broke, it broke. \\n\\nToday \"the herd\" is deeply fractured and looks much less like that mass of peasant factory workers and more like a bunch of auto-exploiting productivity nuts typing frantically in cubicles, working on efficient personal schedules, pleasant, but impersonal, making goals and sub-goals, isolating themselves at home, working from home, and so on. There\\'s still lots of traditional blue collar workers (who often get excluded on subs like this, I must say) but they\\'re smaller in number than they were before, and of course the wage spectrum is wide and so there\\'s not so much of a stark underclass and so on like there was in those late Victorian times. \\n\\nIn other words, in Nietzsche\\'s formulation, which is often misunderstood, I believe the herd is a requirement, and a pre-condition for the individual who rises above the herd. One needs that stark underclass, all unified by nationalistic or religious morality, all ticking along on the same-type wavelength, to produce free spirits (in Nietzsche\\'s view, they came from the aristocracy -- also greatly diminished). Without the unification of the herd, nothing could get done on a national level. There would be no unity, no great projects, and no ability for free spirits to lead the herd into new ways of being. \\n\\nThis is a more accurate picture of our current situation in Nietzschean terms: **the herd is not doing what the herd is supposed to do.** Since the herd will not unify into a herd, there is disunity, disillusionment. There\\'s no established order that the free spirits are supposed to engage with. Left to their own devices, and with only crappy content and paltry, mundane philosophy to engage with (which typically prattles on about how people should be even more productive, work even longer hours, have more discipline \\\\[to work longer hours\\\\], take economic risks, and so on ie: business advice in the guise of personal philosophy), the herd is splitting apart and spinning out in depression and anxiety. \\n\\nIn my opinion, the central flaw to Nietzsche\\'s stuff is that he can\\'t ever imagine a world where everybody is like a free spirit. He thinks it\\'s pretty much impossible, because people are so herd-like in his time. There\\'s not a lot of solutions in Nietzschean philosophy for the current situation: the herd is becoming un-herd-like. **If the defining feature of the overman is that he splits apart from the herd, then what defines the overman in a society without a cohesive herd?** ie: a society of many separate sub-herds living within a wider wage-spectrum (and lead by an elite totally disconnected from any old school European notions of nobility or philosophy, but rather an elite centrally concerned with profit.) Tough questions. \\n\\nI still think that these are sub-herds, and that free spirits remain rare beasts. A free spirit in our situation would naturally try to pull away from what the herd is doing, and if the herd is splitting into isolated groups increasingly obsessed with productivity, then the free spirit might suggest that the herd get back together in unity and re-engage with morals beyond sheer productivity and brutal marketplace ethics.\\n* GT-4 - The Birth of Tragedy: ¬ß 4. First Publ. 02/01/1872. And so, alongside the aesthetic necessity of beauty runs the demand of \"Know thyself\" and \"Not too much!\", while self-aggrandisement and excess were regarded as the actually hostile demons of the non-Apollonian sphere, hence as characteristics of the pre-Apollonian age, the age of the Titans, and the non-Apollonian world, i.e. the barbarian world.\\n* HL-10 - Benefits and disadvantages of history for life: ¬ß 10. First Publ. 22/02/1874. The Delphic God calls out to you, right at the beginning of your journey to that goal, his saying \"Know thyself\". It is a difficult saying: for that God \"does not conceal and does not proclaim, but only points out\", as Heraclitus said. What is he pointing you to?\\xa0\\n* \"Everyone is furthest from himself\" - all the \"triers of the reins\" know that to their discomfort; and the saying, \"Know thyself,\" in the mouth of a God and spoken to man, is almost a mockery. (GS 335)\\n* The cognizer avoids self-knowledge and leaves his roots in the ground. (NF-1882,3\\\\[1\\\\])\\n* I do not know myself: the call to self-knowledge seems to me a divine joke or a Greek child\\'s play (niaiserie): they are rich in it! - But if one has expressed his opinions about 500 things, it is possible for others to \"recognize\" him. So long! (NF-1885,34\\\\[9\\\\])\\n* A matter which is explained ceases to concern us. - What does that god mean who advised \"Know thyself\"? Does that not perhaps mean \"Stop being concerned about yourself! Become objective!\" - And Socrates? - And the \"scientific man\"?- (BGE 80)\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\n**BA-V - On the Future of our Educational Instutions: ¬ß Lecture V, completed ca. 22/03/1872.** Then again he plunges from the height of dreamed-of self-knowledge into ironic scepticism. He strips his struggles of their importance and feels ready for any real, if lowly, usefulness. He now seeks his consolation in a hasty, ceaseless activity, in order to hide from himself under it. \\n\\n**NF-1885,40\\\\[44\\\\] -  August-September 1885.** But this is exactly how I treat myself: self-knowledge does not belong to the feelings of obligation; even if I seek to recognise myself, it is for reasons of usefulness or a finer curiosity, - but not out of a desire for truthfulness. - That the truthful man is worth more than the liar, in the household of mankind, is still to be proved.'},\n",

Universities are no different. Unions are one of the rare instances that have some bargaining power with employers to pressure them into giving their employees better benefits. But even then, the union is bargaining with the employer, not voting on anything, and the employer is within their rights to say no to any demands made by a union. The union reps may ask their wider base what they would like to see, but those reps then make a decision, and that decision may or may not reflect the collective interest of the members.

I looked into just about everything, even just working at a plant nursery, where all of what you mentioned may not be a big deal. Regarding creativity: don't beat yourself up over collecting ideas. We all do it. Someone once said to me: you can only fall as deep as disability pension. True. Not sure where you live, but if worse comes to worse, this might be better than over stressing your brain trying to make it.\\nwhat is ur actual job? im currently studying finance in school and vyvanse has been incredibly helpful in minimizing mistakes and helping me focus on the work.\\nThere are so many things to try but instead of just recommending things that may or may not work, I wanted to mention that there are times where I realize ... no one can tell. It's not apparent to them. And I hold myself to a high standard. When I look around at others and see their output, I realize that I'm still ahead or at least tied with them.\\n\\nDo you get negative feedback?\\nI just posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCT/s/is9XxLx7Tj)on another thread and could be helpful for you.

These are often comorbid conditions with BPD that can cause people to see their bodies totally skewed from reality, and also cause them to predominantly think about that topic (ie.. rumination).  I\\'m a little worried at her doctor\\'s agreeing to go that large as it is starting to sound like a health risk, and a reputable surgeon would probably not agree to do a surgery at this point.\\n\\nWith BPD (and the other disorders mentioned, as well as things like histrionic PD):  we just want a lot of external validation, and it doesn\\'t necessarily mean that we aren\\'t happy with our SO\\'s attention, but the more attention, the more loved you feel, if that makes sense.  This song always reminds me of how i feel, internally: [https://youtu.be/POfxpMqIgRE?si=GT3Cj0L3HVIJRYCg](https://youtu.be/POfxpMqIgRE?si=GT3Cj0L3HVIJRYCg)\\n\\nFinally, if you are starting to pay less attention to her because you aren\\'t as attracted, I think it\\'s totally fair to voice your opinion to her, in a kind way.  This is a helpful format: [DEAR MAN Skill - Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Tools](https://dbt.tools/interpersonal_effectiveness/dear-man.php)  Something like\\n\\n\"Partner, when you continue to get breast augmentations, I feel anxious that I won\\'t continue to be attracted to you as I have noticed a decrease in my attraction as you\\'ve continued to increase in size.  I also feel anxious that you\\'ll be permanently hurt, because each surgery poses a risk of complications.\\n\\nI think you\\'re beautiful as you are, and I want to continue to communicate in ways that will strengthen our connection, which is why I\\'m being honest with you about my feelings now.\\n\\nBefore you have another surgery, I would like to go to couple\\'s counseling to talk about this topic so we can clearly see the perspective of the other person.  <Or insert your proposed way of handling this here>\"\\n\\nBefore you go into the convo, cope ahead with how you\\'d handle different reactions from her (e.g. anger, crying/sadness, defensiveness etc.)  It\\'s probably going to hurt her feelings if you say some of this because a lot of people with BPD have things like rejection sensitive dysphoria as well.  And, at the same time, you\\'re allowed to calmly voice your opinion on matters that affect you and your attraction to your spouse.\\n\\nThen, be ready to really listen to her after you state your opinion to see if there are areas you might compromise on.\\n\\nNeither of you are assholes, btw - you\\'re just on different pages here.\\nYes it‚Äôs extremely common. I was diagnosed BPD at 14, have been living with an eating disorder since 11. \\n\\nBody dysmorphia is a diagnostic criteria for BPD in my country and what you‚Äôre describing is exactly that. What you see, she will never see. I think it‚Äôs poor that surgeons have continued to operate without consideration of her mental health but unfortunately plastic surgery is a profitable business and this will always come first. \\n\\nEnjoying the ‚Äúattention‚Äù she gets will also be under the BPD umbrella unfortunately. \\n\\nYou could try and broach this subject sensitively and talk about her views of her body and discuss your concerns from a place of care about her wellbeing but you have to be open to the fact she may become defensive about this. \\n\\nThis is a very difficult situation and I hope you manage to talk to her in a way that is productive for you both, but I would also be aware that this round of plastic surgery probably won‚Äôt be the last without some sort of therapy and if she isn‚Äôt open to that, I‚Äôd consider how you‚Äôd feel to continue supporting this in your marriage. \\n\\nHugs.\\nYes but this is beyond body image and poor sense of self. It sounds like body dysmorphia and maybe an addiction to plastic surgery.\\nSeek professional help. You cannot control or influence or manipulate her into not wanting these procedures. No matter how hard you try. You don‚Äôt want to control her but it reads as if you want to heavily influence her to not do anything more. \\n\\nIf it wasn‚Äôt her FP did you ever think she is being influenced by social media like millions of other insecure women who go under the knife to live up to photoshopped imaginary women? I recommend you educate yourself more on bpd and find ways to continue to support your wife and seek professional support as well. If you‚Äôre not attracted to her anymore as hurtful as it may be she might need to know that? Attraction and chemistry are important to me in my personal intimate relationships but your wife may have other trait‚Äôs that are more important to her like financial stability material security ect ect. \\n\\nBpd comes from an invalidating environment and bpd suffers often do crazy shit for attention to make up for the reasons why we were invalidated. This is a deep issue within your wife. I recommend you read up on https://emotionsmatterbpd.org/what-is-bpd \\n\\nBpd is different for everyone but this is a great resource for general information and education for loved ones.\\nIt‚Äôs tricky because yes it is her body, her money, her choice, but it is concerning what it might say about her mental health. \\n\\nBefore the first surgery, did she talk about getting to this size? Did she ever say anything more than just ‚Äúbigger‚Äù? If the extreme options have been rolling around in her head since before the beginning, it‚Äôs more likely this is what she wants in a healthy way. But if she was expressing a desire for DDs at the beginning and it‚Äôs only been escalating, then it feels like this is an anxiety/insecurity issue. Only she will ever be able to actually analyze her feelings and know for sure how much of this is rooted in fear rather than self actualization. \\n\\nHow to actually have this conversation in a productive way? Depends on where she is in her mental health journey and how good you are at communicating calmly and compassionately. Is she in therapy or taking meds or learning DBT? From the sounds of it, my guess would be no or it‚Äôs not going great.'},\n",

You can get rebates on this though up to a certain income. As an example, my previous small 90k house was taxed at $4000 in property taxes and $800 in school tax.

I don't mean it in a patronising way, but rather to empathise, as I too had experienced a similar kind of familial toxicity (though maybe not as bad) during my childhood, teens, and even all throughout my 20s. \\n\\nAll my life so far, my relationship with my parents, and especially my father has been nothing but volatile. I have no doubt that in my father's head, he is a man who loves me beyond measure - but I have rarely known of any fatherly love from him. All of the memories I have of him is he criticising me and telling me how I am a disappointment in million different ways. He did provide for me, but he has also used it as a justification to dictate my life choices until he could. My mother, though loving, worshipped my father and could see none of his flaws, and enabled oppression.\\n\\nI, myself, was also brainwashed for a long, long time to not see how this was toxic, and for the first 30 years of my life, I would blame and guilt myself for not being the good daughter that I should have been. \\n\\nI don't have any practical advice that could provide you with relief immediately, but I would urge you to put all the positivity and focus you can muster right now on your A' Levels. Once you get it done, and if you do good, you could apply for scholarships in many different parts of the world and wouldn't need their support. If that doesn't happen, then you may have to wait a little while longer, but this all really ends the moment you are able to provide for yourself financially. Once you no longer have to rely on them, you're free to set your terms. They can either accept, or you can remove them from your life, be it temporarily or permanently. \\n\\nI am sorry that you have had to grow up in an unloving and unhealthy environment as this, but I hope that in the future you would give your child (or those you love) all the love you didn't get. IMO, that is only way to heal from the generational toxicity in Bangladeshi families in the long run. In the short run, it is important to not let guilt take over. There is nothing more harmful that wanting to be a good daughter/child. \\n\\nEvery child is unique with both good and bad, and the onus is actually on the parents to love them unconditionally, and support them. You didn't ask to be born, they brought you into this world, and you don't have to follow their path and lifestyle choices blindly, so long it is not harmful for you.\\nI went through the same thing as you are now going through.\\n\\nI was my mom and dad's punching bag. \\n\\nDad's business suffered loss ? Slapped me , kicked me, called me mc/bc/cc\\n\\nMom had a quarrel with dad ? Beat me black and blue with stick.\\n\\n..........\\n\\n..........\\n\\nIF YOU LET THEM PHYSICALLY ABUSE YOU, IT'LL ONLY CONTINUE.\\n\\nThe only thing that stopped my sperm donor and pumper stop physically abusing me is : I FOUGHT BACK WHEN THEY TRIED TO HIT ME. I ALWAYS HAD A PEN IN HAND, ANYTIME THEY CAME TO HIT ME , I SHOWED THEM I WOULD DIE AND GO TO THE GRAVE WHILE TAKING THEM TOO.\\n\\nDon't chicken out. If someone hits you, fight back whoever they maybe (mom,sis,bro, father etc).\\nwhich part of BD are you from. If you live in cities like Dhaka I would recommend you tutoring kids. But as you said you are barely passing so idk if anyone will hire you for it. I am 18m and I can feel your pain. I would have been already dead if I was in your shoes\\nI don't know what can you do to become financially independent as a 19F other than tutoring kids. There are also a bunch of jobs such as call centre operator, copywriter etc which your family will not approve as I can assume. Try to get into a university which is far away from your home if possible. You could start to live by on your own and gain some sort of mental stability. Of course, you will need allowances from your family. I realize this might sound unrealistic, but it's important to be smart and patient as you find your way out.\\nYou're carrying too much pentup trauma. You sound so broken and lost and it‚Äôs clear you need someone to talk to. The more you try to hold it in the more it‚Äôll eat you up from inside. People can only advise you but you‚Äôre the one who has to walk down the hard path and make amends.\\n\\nThe most realistic thing to do now is to avoid confrontation, focus on finishing uni and find a job. That‚Äôs the most logical way to deal this. Secondly, share your thoughts with someone and stop putting yourself to the standards others set for you.... Stop listening to them. Wherever you are and whoever you are you can always build yourself up to be better. Just be yourself\\n\\n\\n\\nI hope your days gets better with time.

This reminds me what what my life was like before I left home at 19 (minus the added challenges of your medical situation.) I\\'m in my 40\\'s now, and while I\\'ve gotten hazy on specific details (something our brains naturally do to protect ourselves), I cannot forget how soul crushing it was. \\n\\nYou mention your mom is going to therapy, but I\\'m wondering if you also have some kind of regular mental health support?\\n\\nI know your financial situation might make that hard, but you could start looking in your area for free or subsidized mental health services. I used to get free mental health help from a community college. I was attending at the time, but I think they were open to serving the community at large weren\\'t constrained to students only. \\n\\nThe first thing I had to address when I was in that situation was to understand and accept that my BPD mom wasn\\'t going to be helpful in my healing process. People with BPD, and especially those that present like your mom, need so much support themselves that they are simply not not capable of truly helping someone else in a meaningful way. \\n\\nThe reason she \"blacks out\" is because she gets so emotionally off kilter after being triggered that she can only operate on impulse. She doesn\\'t actually have the capacity to think about or understand what she\\'s doing. \\n\\nThat said, her BPD does ***not*** excuse her behavior. It will help to wrap your head around the idea that while she needs help, you and your family are not capable of giving it to her. \\n\\nWhy? \\n\\nBecause the massive negative impact her behavior has on all of you. \\n\\nIt leaves everyone pretty broken, and in great need of protecting themselves in order to heal. \\n\\nI didn\\'t realize it at the time, but when I left, I was beginning to realize that there was nothing I could do to change my mom.  In fact, it was a good life lesson, because it made very clear to me from a very young age that you can\\'t change *anyone* except yourself. \\n\\nSo I started trying to change myself. To *heal* myself.\\n\\nWhen you begin to heal, you\\'ll start to understand why you can\\'t make it happen for someone else. What drives our behavior is so deep within our psyche, that the only person what actually has access is *you*. The same goes for your mom. It\\'s why nothing you do will ever be enough to genuinely make things better for her long-term. That kind of change can only come from *within*. \\n\\nLet go of the expectation that she can help you heal, and vice versa. \\n\\nYou sound like you\\'re in survival mode. I\\'ve been there, and it\\'s not fun. My best advice there is to do any little thing you can to take care of yourself, and make small steps to get yourself some support so you can make the bigger moves later.\\nI could have written this post almost verbatim, except my parents are divorced. I‚Äôm so, so sorry, OP. I literally just went No Contact with my mom yesterday, so I know how painful even considering it is. Like what you said, it‚Äôs not all bad, and the memories of the good keep us holding on wayyyy longer than is healthy for us. \\n\\nI would strongly recommend looking into social services to get help moving out (disability, food stamps, etc). Or perhaps there are friends you could move in with? Even temporarily. I know it‚Äôs not always possible financially, but it is time you truly look at every possible option to get out. \\n\\nThere is no way you can recover and heal physically when you are under so much emotional duress. My partner had Crohns and it always flares up during times of stress. The mind/gut connection is too strong. \\n\\nReading your post and so many here has helped me realize the extent of BPD patterns and behaviors. You are not alone in experiencing things exactly like this. Your feelings of needing it to be done are more than valid. You deserve emotional and physical safety.\\nIt doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love your mom. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs all bad all the time. But you have to choose yourself, however that looks for you.\\nWelcome!\\nMy heart goes out to you. I relate to everything you have said in this post, from the health issues to being heartbroken over your dad also being abused and your mom‚Äôs blackouts. It‚Äôs a special kind of torture to be treated like this by someone you love‚Ä¶ it is so, so painful. You are not alone. \\n\\nThe biggest thing I can say is that I think you will come to a point where you have to choose your health and well being over anything else. With your flare ups, mental health challenges and your dad‚Äôs fainting recently as well, it sounds like this point may have been reached or coming soon. I haven‚Äôt spoken to my mom in 8 months and while I am wracked with near-constant guilt (hoping that eases with time), I knew that I hit a breaking point and had to focus on taking care of ME. At first it feels weird and wrong and selfish but the only person in this world who we can truly change or control, is ourselves. One thing I would say to myself is: ‚ÄúJust because she is a sinking ship and you love her, doesn‚Äôt mean you have to sink with her.‚Äù\\n\\nI definitely think seeking out mental health resources for yourself is a great starting point. Maybe also speaking with your dad and sister about what it would look like to take space and how you could feasibly make that happen. It doesn‚Äôt need to be fully NC with your mom or forever, but in my experience space helps with healing, and is something to consider. \\n\\nSending you so much love. üíô'},\n",

It wasn\\'t just men, it wasn\\'t just women. So when I had a mental health crisis, it was really hard to seek help because it went against what I was taught.

Funny to stumble upon something so relatable by accident. Please let me know if your symptoms end up getting better with the work you‚Äôve been doing\\nMassages for releasing something have only short term effects.\\nThis is the biggest problem in PT, sometimes they give only treatments that relief symptoms, but dont change anything longterm.\\n\\n\\nSo be sure to work on the root causes, the dysfunctions, muscles weakness, etc...as you are doing with exercises.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor FORWARD HEAD/CERVICAL ISSUES:\\nNot just chin tucks, you need cervical extensors strenghtening too.\\nMobility (rotations) and rieducation too.\\nVery important: Middle and Lower trapezius, for example prone T and Y/V raises exercises.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThoracic rotations and extension mobility should be added if you have kyphotic posture,rounded shoulders and spine/sternum pain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mobility\" is something needed for something specific. Not a thing that a person should do randomly with the mindset of \"more is better\".\\n\\n\\nIf you are sedentary and inactive, you ll have big benefits from pilates etc.\\n\\n\\nDiaphragm breathing exercises yes.\\n\\n\\nExcessive stretching...No!\\nIf you stretch and muscle and dont feel anything, stop.\\nSame as mobility, the more isnt better.\\nYou dont need neither too short neither too long muscles.\\nThis can confuse you, but it s how body works.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want you can take cervical and others exercises here:\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Posture/comments/1ep0a0r/if_your_posture_never_got_better_change_method_an/\\n\\n\\n\\nAt least add cervical extensions.\\nSuboccipital muscles(what Pt massages you) become chronically tight and overwork because the deep extensors of cervical spine arent working..so you need them, not just chin tucks.\\nThat\\'s pretty relateable. I\\'ve had neck pain and spent way too much time on the internet in my younger days practicing terrible posture. Once, for a few days, I felt like I was just constantly wanting to fall backwards and I wasn\\'t sure if there was some major neurological issue or what. I workout these days and work on posture so I\\'m much better and haven\\'t had that issue since. So as far as dizziness and vertigo go, it could well be due to bad posture.\\n\\nI have bad anxiety too and when I do my front core tightens which makes me want to slump. The way I\\'ve handled it is, even if I\\'m going to be anxious, I mentally re-route that tension to more relevant muscles needed for posture. I use a stool now so I can\\'t totally relax when sitting anyway which makes me not sit too long, which is again something I need to do.\\nSeems like my story. And i figured out that it\\'s all related to posture you are on the right path and actually indeed anxiety, brain fog, tiredness it\\'s all related to posture. Ribcage position and hip mobility.... all boils down to Posture. But correcting it is a hell of a lot of work and patience. You need to find kinesiologist or movement patterns expert. Specially trained in Bill Hartmann model.  You can start focusing on videos from greg Chaplin, Zac cupples, Bill Hartmann. It\\'s 100 percent correctable'},\n",

I‚Äôve already had my social media deactivated for around 4 months now\\n\\nBut I still ended up dooming scrolling on apps like YouTube. This should be my final step towards true freedom\\nThis is beautiful. A thoughtful and motivating reflection on your experience. Thank you so much.\\nThank a lot for sharing your dumbphone journey ! I enjoyed a lot reading this !\\n\\nThe ¬´\\xa0if that‚Äôs important they‚Äôll text/call\\xa0¬ª is so real ! I noticed that‚Äôs after switching to a dumbphone the only things that need internet on a smartphone phone are not THAT important, i always remind to myself ¬´\\xa0if social media or any internet based apps are so important then how were we living in the late 2000‚Äôs ? we just lived that‚Äôs it !\\xa0¬ª\\nDuring that time i had a a Sony Ericsson W995 that i used only for music on my way to school and to call my parents to reassure them that i arrived at school safely or if i had an emergency.\\nI took the bus everyday to go to school and for the bus schedule i just used the paper version, it‚Äôs as simple as that, and i survived lol.\\n\\nIn 2024, it feels that we need a smartphone for everything since everything get more and more digital but actually there‚Äôs no law that force ourself to get a smartphone or a phone at all, how the elderly or some disabled people do then ? Or what if your phone battery dies ? There should always be a non digital version for any task (ex : i hate qr codes menus at restaurants, is that more complicated to print out menus ? As said previously what if your battery dies or your camera is broken, you don‚Äôt eat ?).\\n\\nFor my experience after switching to a dumbphone lifestyle i noticed that i accept more to be bored or waiting to get at home at the end of the day to check youtube/reddit or to talk with my friends, waiting for this moment makes you appreciate it more ! It‚Äôs as exciting as waiting for a day out with your friends, you notice the precious value of the moments !\\nYou\\'ve worded exactly this growing desire I\\'ve been having... I resonated with every sentiment of yours, with \"Clockwork Oranging myself\" and \"being force-fed the seven deadly sins\" hitting close to home, because that\\'s exactly what I feel has worsened my experience of technology, not to speak of my overall cognitive performance (which should be alarming in and of itself!). Being born in 2001 I\\'m lucky enough to remember a very few years before algorithmically tailored, short-form content where using devices was exciting, as you said preparing media for yourself to enjoy in doses in the upcoming days rather than shoving down anything, instantly, shocking the brain over and over again to squeeze out some cheap pleasure. Reading this post has reminded me of all this. I\\'m determined to strip my cellphone of all the \"cheap pleasures\", I\\'m curious and excited to see how it will go :)\\nThanks OP, your post resonates so much with me. I\\'ve only just started looking at this sub and I\\'m keen yet hesitant to make the switch. Crazy how much I view my smartphone as something of a lifeline, which on reflection is perhaps a good enough reason itself to make the switch!  \\nMy anxious brain keeps going \"yeah but what if x, y, or z happens and you\\'re stuck somewhere without a smartphone!?\" as if I\\'ve had one my whole life and cannot breathe without one. It\\'s crazy how much it has a hold on me. Which is how it feels. It has started to feel suffocating, or maybe just too much like a comforter.\\n\\nI was relative latecomer to smartphones and have only had one for about 10 years, but in that time my concentration span has steadily gotten worse, my sleep has gotten worse, I haven\\'t read as many books as in the 10 years before that, etc. I am in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD (actually more ADD) and I think the smartphone just doesn\\'t fit at all well with such neurodiversity conditions. The usage patterns, distraction and dopamine disruption, etc.  \\nI have come to realise that I\\'m addicted to my smartphone, to doomscrolling, to online shopping, to social media to some extent (I use WhatsApp and Facebook but can and do avoid them at times), er... Reddit!  \\nI have tried limiting it\\'s use recently - leaving it at home a couple of times when going out for a walk, not leaving it on my bed side table at night so that I don\\'t look at it during the night (which is perhaps the habit I loathe the most right now), etc, but these haven\\'t stuck, as, well, like I said I\\'m addicted and it\\'s not easy to give up or control because that\\'s the nature of addiction. So I think I need to cut the cord as keeping the smartphone to use with wifi just means that I\\'ll continue to do that all the time and just use the dumb phone for making calls and texting, and I\\'ll end up walking around with and managing two phones which is more even more ridiculous than the situation I\\'m in now!\\n\\nAnyway not sure why I\\'m putting this here. Felt appropriate rather than making my own post. I guess I just cannot fathom how one has the discipline to keep their smartphone but not continue to use it 24/7 whether it has a SIM card in or not. The lack of a simcard would only slightly curb my use and to be honest after some time - maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks, maybe longer (although likely not) - I would miss it (i.e. the dopamine cycle) so much and rationalise any excuse (which is how addiction works) to simply put the sim back in the smartphone and guiltily ditch the dumbphone. Hmm, don\\'t think this is going to be easy for me!\\n\\nThanks again for sharing though OP!'},\n",

When you call, after some logistical questions and verification, a licensed counselor will answer the phone and does an intake session with you to understand what brings you to counseling (generally 30min-1hr). After the intake session, they let you know if they recommend the further counseling sessions for you to work through the issue. (I haven't had them not offer the additional counseling sessions). They can be telephone sessions, video sessions, sometime in-person sessions. Telephone sessions they can generally schedule you pretty quick for the sessions, generally less quick for the video and generally much less quick for the in-person.

Get in the other line, much shorter, of people who have a professional obligation to look after them.\"\\n\\nI deal with my feelings by acknowledging them and setting them aside; it\\'s only relevant to their care insofar as it\\'s a significant source of bias. Plenty of coronial inquests are about unsavoury people who, no matter their unsavouriness, didn\\'t deserve to die.\\n\\nYou used a great word, countertransference, and perhaps this is a good time to reflect on why their behaviour provokes such strong feelings in you. How would your parents have delt with you if you behaved like this?\\nPsych Reg here to add my two cents.\\n\\n\\nThe most important and difficult thing about counter-transference is recognizing that you\\'re experiencing it. So kudos on you for reflecting on that!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s important to recognize counter-transference, firstly because it is associated with burnout and therefore it is important to recognize and manage it before it leads to your work being affected. A debrief with a trusted colleague or even a non-work friend (can be a very casual debrief) can go a long way in dealing with counter transference and avoiding it\\'s negative impact. One trick that my supervisor taught me was doing a mindless or a mundane task after a particularly difficult work day can help reset some of the countertransfer (I do this by either putting on a sitcom that I enjoy and have watched many times before or scrolling on my phone).\\n\\n\\nSecondly, it\\'s important to recognize counter-transference because you\\'re not obligated to like everyone you treat but you are obligated to treat everyone to the best of your abilities and negative counter-transference can lead to sub-consciously providing sub-standard care to that pt. So it is important to recognize that you\\'re experiencing negative countertransfer from a pt and making sure you\\'re still treating them the same way you would treat any other pt.\\n\\n\\nLastly, knowing the underlying cause of the pts\\' behavior can go a long way in developing empathy towards them and managing countertransfer. The example you gave of the pt who takes no responsibility and puts everything on others. That is very commonly seen in pts with cluster B traits and it\\'s called having an \"external locus of control.\" It can stem from having horrible things done to you in the past and your agency being taken away that you start viewing the world as having no control in it. It can also be a maladaptive coping/defense mechanism - your life is so miserable that it is easier and more comforting to blame everyone else for it than to consider that you might have contributed to it yourself or take responsibility that you have a role to play to fix it (which is a lot more daunting thing to confront).\\nPsych Reg here - it is complicated and you have to look beyond the behaviour.\\n\\ncountertransference/transference and projection identification is a very powerful defence mechanism and way of seeking help/getting needs met/pulling people close/attachment seeking behaviour. \\n\\n  \\nprojection identification involves projecting for example their own hatred of self onto the doctor. The doctor then internalises this and projects it back onto the patient. Ultimately fulfilling the patients belief they are a bad person. \\n\\nThis behaviour is unconsciously driven.\\n\\nYou have to consider the vulnerability of this person. And the psychological regression that is entailed in a hospital admission. Behaviour regression, acting out, escalating behaviour to elicit responses. \\n\\nSome people have a background where the only time they were \"held\" by their parents was in restraint. So using aggression is a way to draw near. \\n\\nYou also have to consider re-enactments which are occurring between the patient and yourself.  for example Re-enacting relationships with care-givers (or lack there of) \\n\\nYou also have to consider the power dynamics at play - Mental health act, involuntary treatment. Persons who have a background of trauma are very vulnerable to power dynamics.\\n\\nWhat Im saying is you have to display empathy and reflect on how this person makes you feel. If you feel irritated i bet they feel irritated. IF you hate them I bet they hate themselves.\\nI find kicking them out cathartic to be honest. \\n\\nBeing a psych reg is a lot like being a car salesman. You can find enjoyment in being able to convince these people to follow the plan you have outlined. \\n\\nThe PC answer is that these people often have went through significant trauma and a lot of the things they say are clues to pathology underneath. It‚Äôs more enjoyable when you see them as a puzzle to understand rather than someone being a dick\\nThe points being made by other commenters are absolutely valid: these are symptoms of underlying disorders/unmet needs etc so there is still work to be done on some level.\\n\\nHowever, if you\\'re dealing with an asshole, you can provide all the empathy in the world. You can sympathise with every trauma and disadvantage that life has thrown their way. You can be fully understanding of how they ended up being an asshole.\\n\\nBut they\\'re still an asshole.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t acknowledge that, and acknowledge the response it generates in you and the toll it takes just interacting with some patients, you will end up accruing a whole heap of negative emotions that you won\\'t process until it is too late and you, too, hath become yonder asshole.\\n\\nDo your best. Sometimes, you\\'ll get to see that crystallizing moment where someone actually internalises a change, but you\\'ll miss that opportunity if you\\'re burning all your empathy on every single person that comes through the door.\\n\\nLook after yourself, and look after your team. If you feel this way, the nurses and fresher doctors might be copping it more consistently but trying to appear professional by suppressing all of this until they pop. Coffees, donuts and debriefs (even if it\\'s just a quick \"Christ, how frustrating was that guy yesterday!?\") go a long way to making people feel okay about being meat for the healthcare machine.'},\n",

You're having Quite A Time, aren't you?  My mom was an alcoholic too.  It was hard for me to learn that she was an adult and in control of her own life and if she knew her lungs were going bad but still smoked, they were her lungs and it was her life.  I eventually learned that she was the only one who could change her behavior.  I'm not going to suggest meetings to you; you don't need more things to do, but you might want to start reading the Adult Children of Alcoholics website.  Don't expect magic from reading it; the tough times you had growing up had a cumulative effect on you, and I discovered that it's work to get rid of the cumulative effects.

She's mean, she carries grudges other people don't even know she has, and she badmouths people all the time.  If she's mad, she'll say nasty things about you for days to everyone who crosses her path, and if she later finds out she was wrong, she doesn't bother correcting what she said so that everyone else still thinks you did the horrible thing she imagined.\\n\\nHugs to you.

If they keep doing it, communicate to them that your friendship may not being able to continue. \\n\\nIf they care about you and are a healthy relationship to have, they should at the very least try to respect your boundaries. Having mental illness themselves is not an excuse. If you are clearly communicating to them that \"This thing you are doing hurts me\" and they ignore it and keep hurting you, its not a good friendship to have, imo. But if you want to try to salvage the relationship, you first have to assume ignorance and be SUPER clear and serious that these questions are not okay and you need to protect yourself.\\nWhat you‚Äôre feeling is entirely normal and appropriate for the situation. If someone does not respond to repeated request and statements about their behavior than they are in capable of addressing the issue at some level and it‚Äôs up to you to decide if you‚Äôre going to continue to tolerate that or separate yourself. One of the problems with CPTSD is a lot of the times we don‚Äôt have very good understanding of our boundaries or respect for them. You‚Äôre frustrated because you‚Äôre not respecting your boundary and allowing this to continue you need to shut off the conversation and walk away, and if that doesn‚Äôt get taken because this person doesn‚Äôt get it or doesn‚Äôt choose to get it and for that I feel for you and you have my empathy\\nSet a boundary with them. \"That\\'s something I don\\'t talk about.\" Or \"That\\'s something I don\\'t want to hear about.\" \\n\\nFull stop.

It might be that you ignore them, it might be that you leave the room, whatever it is I recommend a passive approach that just disengages from the conversation. Anything that engages them actively could be read as you encouraging/enabling them, even though that\\'s the last thing you want.\\n\\nA lot of people who are invasive, enmeshed, or resistant to boundaries will complain that a boundary is an attempt to control them. So, just in case they bring up that argument, remind them that you are not controlling them. They can do what they want. And you can do what you want, such as immediately leaving the conversation. You are controlling *your* behavior.\\n\\nFinally, a boundary is not a punishment. It\\'s something you do for yourself to move through life more easily. You deserve that, and it\\'s not inconveniencing anyone else. It can be hard and uncomfortable to establish a new boundary, especially if you\\'ve known someone for a long time. But sometimes that also works in our favor ‚Äî if they think they know us well, showing our assertive side can catch them off guard and inspire them to take us more seriously.\\n\\nIt all depends so much on the person, but I hope some of this helps!\\nTell them to stop asking questions like that.\\n\"Trauma is uncomfortable and unless I bring it up or it\\'s relevant to some discussion we\\'re already having please don\\'t bring it up.

       "  'comments': 'Wow. Do other regional offices do these type of events? Like in TX?\\nI can 100% agree that if there is any chance you can attend I highly recommend it. I went to the same event wanting to get an update on 2 pending claims. The first claim seemed to be a no brainer, the C&P exam was completed, it seemed like all the docs were there so I thought maybe I could get it rated on the spot. The second claim was for PTSD. I\\'ve been waiting on a C&P exam and my goal for that claim was to get an exam scheduled. When I sat down with a rater we talked about the reason for my visit and we started with the PTSD claim.\\n\\nSide note: Prior to this event I had a C&P exam for insomnia secondary to GERD. Ultimately the examiner opined the insomnia was not connected to GERD but based on the hour and a half exam the examiner determined my PTSD and other MH conditions were caused while in service. So with that information I submitted a secondary claim for PTSD. \\n\\nSo, during the conversation with the rater I told him I had an exam for insomnia and the DBQ should be listed. The rater found the DBQ, read through it and said, \"@#%@%, I can\\'t understand why someone didn\\'t pick this up. I can get this knocked out in about 30 minutes.\" I was, \"let\\'s do this.\" At that point I thought the rater was going to walk me out and work on it a little later but instead the rater took care of everything as I watched. When he finished, he got in a chat with another team who does the QC & approvals and told them he was sending my claim over. The rater got a response from the other team saying I was next. I was impressed. Not wanting to push my luck, I had to ask about the first claim. The rater told me since it was a PACT Act claim it need a deeper look. I accepted that answer and thanked the rater for all of his help. \\n\\nAs I drove home I kind of expected it would take VA a week or so to get everything wrapped up and determine my rating. It was an hour drive from the event to the house. When I got home I checked my overall rating just for shits & grins, I was floored. I went from 90% (86% in total) to 100% (96%). It turns out I was rated 70% for PTSD. Needless to say, I was speechless. I was amazed for the small investment of 5 hours, (driving to and from the event, wait time & discussion with the rater) I managed to get my rating over the top. But it doesn\\'t stop there, about a week later I received the decision letter and was surprised I ended up at 100% P&T.\\n\\nI highly recommend if at all possible, try and go to this event next week. I can\\'t say you\\'ll end up with same rating but at least you\\'ll be able see how sausage is made. It could be well worth your time. Good luck.\\nThanks for that. \\n\\nWill make an effort to attend.\\nNow is there something like this for Georgia?\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj5x6xvxwomd1.jpeg?width=717&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df0ea34ee47dde57ae1f22e649e72c033f291957'},\n",

While it\\'s fine to have emotions in any discussion of public policy (and I actually encourage it), there still needs to be an understanding without the emotions; that starts with how you (the one wanting change) understand the system as it currently is.\\nLike I said in the other thread, this is a voting issue. If you vote for people who want to strip workers of their rights, you‚Äôre going to get employer friendly WC laws. Each state makes their own WC laws so the best way to initiate actual change is by voting for people who support this change from local county elections all the way up.\\n[deleted]'},\n",

Learning process depends heavily on the game I am trying to learn. I almost always start learning a game before I purchase it to make sure I‚Äôll enjoy the game, either how to play videos or the actual rule book if I can find it online. Then I tend to set the game up and stumble through a few plays of the game while making sure I am getting rules right, this can be tedious but it helps me to lock in processes that each game has. With complicated games or games that confuse me I go step by step and focus on each point, with something like Final Girl certain combinations of killer and environment can have lots of overhead to track so don‚Äôt worry about going slow. At the end of the day solo board gaming for me is about having fun, I don‚Äôt care about wins or losses or how long it takes to play one game I just want the experience.\\nThis is a great game!

No need to explain yourself here. \\n\\nA couple things that helped me out early in the hobby. Final Girl, like most games, is a very particular kind of game. It invokes some stress and it can be swingy - a term to describe when random rolls or events can heavily impact ganeplay. The weight - which describes how complex/hard to learn a game is - is fairly light for gamers, but def has a lot of mechanisms for people early to the hobby.\\n\\nAll that is to say, there is a LOT to explore :) There are so so many types of games that range in theme and mechanics. Personally, I like Final Girl, but it\\'s not one I play often as a \"go-to\" game. I have to be in the right mood.\\n\\nThe YouTube/reviewer space for board games is huge. This sub is really good.

       "  'comments': 'i believe that everyone who keeps trying to shift will eventually do it, and it\\'s mostly about the composition of our community and specifically why *we* are attracted to shifting. \\n\\n- if anyone has the ability to shift, everyone does. there\\'s nothing about shifting itself that would be an innate ability, but some people are more inclined towards meditation and focus, which allows them to shift faster. \\n\\n- everyone who tries to shift, on some level, believes in shifting and their ability to do it. \\n\\n- everyone who is attracted to shifting as a concept is open-minded enough to allow it to be a possibility. \\n\\n- the skills of meditation and focus *increase* in time, not decrease. \\n\\n- you will know yourself better the more that you try to shift, including what methods work for you, what you enjoy doing, what feels comfortable, etc. \\n\\nshifting is a skill just like any other, but it\\'s the only one that we think has less likelihood of working the more time passes.\\nI think it takes a well rounded foundational understanding of what this all is, and why it\\'s \"hard\" to do anything in this field.\\n\\nPeople live human lives but ultimately we\\'re not human, were the energy moving through the human body. We take on this/these roles but we continue to exist long after our human bodies die. \\n\\nNow, as a person we learn through rigorous testing and boundary pushing from our youth that we need to guard our minds against foolish thoughts like \"if I jump off the roof with an umbrella I\\'ll float down like Mary poppins!\" (Been there as a kid, ouch, don\\'t recommend) and as you grow you become more jaded I would say. And as far as your human life goes that works quite well. You learn to doubt yourself healthily.\\n\\nNow someone springs on you that you CAN float like Mary poppins, or literally anything else you desire! Now what\\'s the catch? Well, you have to go against your human instinct to doubt. And doubting is hard to deny, it\\'s literally keeping you from an early death in a daily basis. But the voice that tells you what you can and can\\'t do is quite literally not you, not who you are ultimately. And it\\'s hard to fight. I\\'ve lived my life as a rational and skeptic and the idea of living based on my desires and choices was ridiculous. Even more so the spiritual. But I went through a dark night of the soul (more like dark 3 years of the soul if we\\'re being honest) and that pushed me to pursue psychedelics as a form of last ditch help. They put me on a path of spiritual awareness. \\n\\nSo what I\\'ve learned is that the subconscious thoughts are the hardest to change because that\\'s where your truth lies, in my opinion. You can think you want to shift and think you\\'re in control but there\\'s a part of you deep down that tells you how you really feel. And there\\'s not much I can say other than my growth continues daily and I\\'ve noticed my subconscious thoughts more than ever. And sometimes they\\'re WILDLY negative, but you have to learn to let that go. More importantly they\\'re overwhelmingly positive these days and the doubts are almost non existent, and that\\'s why I\\'ve been able to go from here to a better cr and back. I\\'m so much more in tune with myself and the world and I can literally see the changes I want appearing. Now things aren\\'t always perfect, and there can still be subconscious doubts but just like bad thoughts at any point, notice them and move on. Bit by bit you mould yourself into the person you want to be and with that self alignment comes beautiful experiences in this life and beyond.\\n\\nLong ass comment, **TL;DR: You have to believe in yourself wholly (laaaame but that\\'s what it boils down to)** and if you think you believe already and it\\'s not working, think again honestly. Who are you? Why are you here? What do you REALLY want? Is there bad shit in your life? Well you chose it. You\\'re a shifter/projector/God/awareness acting human. YOU CHOOSE, right? It\\'s the only way to shift so remember that! Keep working on yourself, your self love, and your self worth. The only way to progress in my experience and once you experience the next rung on the ladder you look back and say OF COURSE I can\\'t believe I didn\\'t see it or feel it until now but it\\'s unmistakably true. And you grow more and more each day.\\n\\nIf anyone has anything to add or rebut I\\'d love to hear your takes.\\nno i think everyone has the potential to shift, but some people won‚Äôt ever shift due to giving up/lack of belief in themselves.\\nunfortunately i‚Äôve been wondering the same thing. thank god i‚Äôm slightly egoistic so i simply Can‚Äôt accept the idea that /i/ might be one of the people who fall into the category of being unable to shift but whenever someone says ‚Äúanyone can shift!‚Äù im always like welllll how would you know ? it‚Äôs not like i 100% believe that that‚Äôs not the case, maybe everyone really does have that ability but i just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to know really ?\\ni do think eventually they are going to shift, if the never give up. a lot of people that haven‚Äôt shifted just gave up and im like‚Ä¶ now the possibility of you living your dream life is at 0. id rather take the chance of maybe shifting then completely give up on it'},\n",

Stephen Hawking had degrees coming out of his ears, doesn\\'t mean he didn\\'t have any disabilities üôÑ\\nReapplying, instead of challenging this decision (first with Mandatory Reconsideration request and then, if unsuccessful, with an appeal to the Tribunal) would surrender any backpay from the beginning of this claim. \\n\\nIf awarded after reapplying you will only be paid back from the beginning of the new claim, not the old one.\\nI\\'m in a similar situation (applied for physical (hypermobility) and mental health (general + autism), and there was heavy reliance on the fact I was doing a Masters and therefore was ineligible). I was given no points at application, none at mandaotory reconsideration and 19 at tribunal. So the next step (I assume you already have the assessment report - if not ring up the PIP helpline and request this) is to begin drafting an MR, you can do this over the phone or post (I found post easier). Basically try and see what they\\'ve used against each activity (or overall) and refute this. For instance for the masters, I sent in my student support sheet, and contact with the disability team, however, this wasn\\'t viewed as \\'relevant\\' to give me points until tribunal (bad wording but they kinda just ignored it until tribunal where I got a chance to speak). In terms of the HSD, the evidence I gave was a screenshot of my NHS app, and then evidence of my physiotherapy and detailed muscle weaknesses which seems like a lot less than you provided so very odd they didn\\'t consider it.\\n\\nBasically - apply for MR. Read the assessment report and criteria for PIP and explain why they have misinterpreted something, or why the Masters is actually not relevant to any descriptors etc and send this off. I personally don\\'t think it would be worth waiting to re-apply with the new diagnosis as it would explain the issues you have now, and wouldn\\'t (I dont think) change much, other than your symptoms having a new name. You could get citizens advice to help with the MR, or you can do it alone if that\\'s easier.\\nLots of people who have PIP work, it‚Äôs not means tested. I was a full time teacher when I got full PIP, enhanced for both.

Anytime you get additional diagnosis (though I don‚Äôt know what having a diagnosis on EDS over having the hyper mobility diagnosis will get you, unless it‚Äôs for the comorbidities that EDS can bring) you can add this new evidence to your next appeal/ tribunal.

I should have used a rollator when before I started using a cane, and I should have used a wheelchair at the time I started using that rollator.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyears and years of senseless pain that I could have avoided if I had not been too proud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy suggestion is that if you feel like you need it, then you need it.\\nI 100% understand, where you're coming from. But there is one thing I have learned from having a dog with behaviour issues in the past, which I think applies here as well.\\n\\n\\nWhen it was recommended that we use a muzzle (just in case), I did not like the idea. I was wondering what people might think and how it would change how they interact with the dog. I then very quickly learned that this was exactly what we needed. Other people being able to see that the dog was struggling, allowed them to be more accommodating. They gave the dog more space, didn't approach the dog uninvited and didn't overreact to the dog's barking, because it all made sense to them. She still got pats from the right kind of people, but always on her terms. That, in turn, allowed the dog to be much more relaxed and happier. In a way, using mobility aids is similar. Aside from these aids providing the physical support you need, it helps people seeing your invisible health condition and being more accommodating. They will likely also take your struggle more seriously, because for a lot of people invisible disabilities aren't as serious and visible ones. So, it will likely not only make the physical side of things easier for you, but also reduce the struggle of having to constantly explain what others cannot see or understand.\\n\\n\\nI ordered a collapsible walking stick yesterday, as I'm also finding the transition difficult. This way, I can carry it in my bag and just use it as needed to begin with. This may not be a solution that works for you, but maybe you can come up with something else that helps you easing into it a bit more.\\n\\n\\nAlso, based on the experiences of people I know, who started using mobility aids, they all hated the idea to begin with, but every single one said that they're glad they gave it a go once they tried it.\\xa0\\nI have the same problem, walking triggers PEM for me but I'm scared to use a wheelchair. I'm scared of what people will think. I think I'd probably need one that I don't have to push myself because that would probably trigger PEM too but I don't think I can even afford one of those anyway. I had to quit my job and I'm not well enough to think about claiming benefits right now, it's way too stressful. \\n\\nHaving to stay in the house so much is bad for my mental health too. I was always outdoorsy and all my hobbies were active. This illness just sucks.\\nI understand where you are coming from completely. I have gotten to the point in life where I know that I can't control what others think. Using an aid makes life that little or much easier. Frankly others who make a comment or judge, they are not the ones who have to deal with the pain or PEM. Would they suggest a person with glasses not wear them? I'm sorry the people around you aren't giving you the support you deserve. Sometimes if a person like a Doctor, or someone like that backs the idea it can help the naysayers. Good luck.\\nI get it. I started using a cane last week. My knee was really messed up. But it started to feel better so I stopped. And now it‚Äôs hurting again. \\nSo I guess moral of my story is just use it because it really does help. \\nAnd people were so nice! I was ya know acting normal and stuff and I had someone open the door. A guy let me go ahead in line so I wouldn‚Äôt h e to stand. And then when I dropped my cane someone ran over and picked it up for me. It was a pleasant surprise\"},\n",

[Here‚Äôs an example of another post in this sub that was looking to do a yard overhaul, and the list of tasks I suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/s/0ytTT5GYzP). Maybe you‚Äôll get some inspo to get started, and maybe you can even show your mom! The poster made a follow up post when they were done if you wanna check out an after.\\nI wouldn't post the pictures- your mom doesn't even want you taking them. Descriptions should be fine.\\n\\nOnce you have your plan, ask your mom what she would prefer you to start with. For example, if the grass bothers her the most, start with whatever needs to happen to mow the lawn. \\n\\nI saw below that you think this could be her sanctuary and it might build up to inside the house and I think you're right to start with the garden!! But I would start with safety issues as my first focus in the garden (ie get rid of the big toys that are trip hazards before worrying about weeds in the pavement cracks). If/when she gives you permission/it's time to tackle the inside, again start with focusing on safety issues.\\nI really don't think you should secretly photograph your mom's mess, and definitely don't post the pictures online if you do.\\nGo for it! I think garden is habitat. Agree with others though re permission re pictures.\"},\n",
