Acknowledging my feelings about my blindness,38,Blind,"I totally understand your perspective, I have had my fair share of surguries that didn't work too! 

I think the most important thing to remember is that sight (while very useful and awesome) is not needed to live my life to the fullest. I can be positive and recognize that yeah, I AM missing out on stuff. yeah people DO take me less seriously, and I DO get discriminated against in the workplace. But there are things that make life worth it anyway. 

Toxic positivity is definitely a problem in the disabled community. It diminishes our ability to get help because we are suddenly superhumans or inspiration porn. I'm definitely not toxicly positive. 

But I have learned to love again, love my s/o, my hobbies and my life. It took a long time. And I'm still learning, but I'm alive. And I am stubborn as hell. And I'm gonna live a damn good life regardless ü§£


I wish you the best, you are lovef, you matter. ‚ù§"
Do you feel more impediment in your everyday life due to your blindness or due to the causes of that blindness?,32,Blind,"this is a very interesting post and im sure there's a lot more people who also go through this. I can only speak for myself though, and unfortunately I've been in both situations when I felt the impediments  was due to my blindness and others when they were due to the causes. 

I have aniridia, a rare eye condition that has consequences such as ulcerations, cataracts and glaucoma as well.  For now I only have cataracts and a corneal scar on my right eye.   A few years ago  I started getting a lot of ulcerations and it was very painful . I had to leave in the middle of class a lot because I couldn't bare the classroom lights or screens, and just any sort of sensory stimulation made it somehow worse.  I spent a while at home until I finally recovered and stopped having pain, but it was a a major set back in studies and affected my mental health. So, I know what that's like to a certain extent. 

Without the pain,  which would be most of my life, the impediments I've comed across have been caused by the blindness itself.  It's a real shame because glaucoma is such a shitty thing , but I still think there should be a way around it. I know people with glaucoma who manage to do pretty normal activities, they just have to find the way adapt it to their needs.  Perhaps you can't jog but you can do some exercise on a fixed bike, or just gp for long walks . Sure, it isn't as thrilling, but its better than nothing. 

family and doctors have a tendency to over protect because they probably want to avoid risking it . Sometimes its simply up to us to overcome that barrier if we truly believe we have the capability. ."
