"The older I get, the more I realize Hearing people are the ones disabled and not the Deaf people.",0,deaf,"I agree with your usage of the German word behinderung, ""being obstacled (sic)"". However, you are directing it in the wrong direction. Hearing people are the one suffering from behinderung, that is, via creating policies, procedures, laws, medical models, and many other environmental harms that causes normal Deaf children to become literally cognitively and/or psychologically disabled from linguistic deprivation and/or educational deprivations. 

Don't believe me? Here is a simple snapshot of a disabling world Hearing people created against the Deaf people: 

Google Scholar - [Deaf mental health language deprivation](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C24&q=deaf+mental+health+language+deprivation&oq=Deaf+linguistic+deprivation) 

It is the Hearing populations failure to understand the world in a proper way that causes no harm that makes them disabled and we need to assist them with their disability. One way is by creating threads like this to address it, especially addressing misconceptions such as yours. 

Example: 

1. If Hearing people get bored because of no sounds while driving, then they have been taught poorly on how to drive properly and how to keep themselves properly simulated via environmentally appropriate coping skills that doesn't rely on sounds. That's not the Deaf people's fault but solely on the shoulders of the Hearing world. Even ASL interpreters (mostly CODAs) agrees with this perspective, thus adding weights that even a Hearing person can correct the problems by using Deaf visual solutions. 
2. ""Bigger screens"" = more problems? It actually led to less problems because the screen is big enough to quickly glance at it to grab more information before looking back on the road. The smaller screens were causing a lot of problems, hence the change to bigger screens. Do your research first before making strange claims. 
3. Do you know why I ""generalized""? Because I cannot write a whole thesis on a Reddit page. I expect educated people to understand why I generalized by being able to extrapolate prior point of views and use creative thinking and abstract reasoning abilities to obtain new thoughts and ideas. If you had to accuse me of generalized statements, that only goes to prove that you cannot broaden your own horizon by your own efforts, thus defending your own status quo by making accusations towards people like me who CAN create those kinds of broad ways of thinking. 
4. In fact, here is an example of being able to extrapolate. Is the fact that you socialize with people that can think on a broader horizon because you're unable to do it on your own and need to depend on others to do it for you? 

Those are simply food for thoughts. I can easily serve a whole meal course full of scholar information but I don't want to do the dirty work for lazy people, regardless on if they're Deaf or Hearing."
