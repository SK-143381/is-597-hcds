Everything I read about burnout seems to be geared toward people with families who are trying to do it all. Where’s the burnout book for single disabled people who are exhausted from just trying to exist in the world?,300,disability,"i’m not single but i am working full time and doing grad school with all my disabilities. it’s super fucking hard sometimes. i’m on a decent med regimen now so my mental health is great! which makes me more able to do things. but my physical health is terrible right now
Yeh I feel like that is the real problem no one can fix. 

Best I can do is doing constant work to remind myself not to be driven to burn out because of the guilt and shame our capitalist, class obsessed society relentlessly shoves down our mouths. 

Just that constant mental battle alone takes up even more time and energy that I don't have and losing the battle most days is a terrible weight on my mental health. 

I'm really trying to change my reaction to these bs social norms but it's not easy when it's ubiquitous in every facet of life and relationships with other people, so it's always a neverending and severely draining battle on top of all of the shame, guilt, disappointed, lonelyness,  depression and more endless misery it entails."
"""Disabilities only exist because of society"" is an ignorant statement made to cope with internalized ableism imo",206,disability,"I consider the terms 'condition', 'impairment, and 'disability to be very different.  As an advocate for Accessibility and Accommodation in the workplace, I help the members of my grassroots community to speak with the policymakers and ensure their concerns are heard. I am not always confident that progress will happen, but we persevere.
Depends on the disability. 

Personally, my adhd is something where the problems I face are largely societal. I don’t want a “cure” for myself because I honestly don’t want to be NT. The best thing would be to build systems which are more inclusive. I’m lucky enough to be in a field and in a workplace which suits me well and can capitalize on that difference. 

But my chronic pain and joint injuries are not disabilities because of society. They’re miserable because I’m in pain and I can’t sleep or function when they’re acting up. Yeah they’re way worse because societal factors have frequently made them worse by forcing me to use my limbs and increase my pain anyway, but I’ve been working to cure them for years. 

I’m the middle I’ve got allergies to fragrances (including vapes) and weed. That makes lots of situations around other people potentially deadly. If we as a society didn’t think creating a cloud of fragrance or smoke around you in public spaces was acceptable since it gets into other peoples bodies in potentially harmful ways, I wouldn’t have this issue. But so many people are allergic to different things that I accept eliminating everything that releases compounds into the air is not a reasonable ask. A few hundred years ago, I’d be able to breathe just fine so it’s technically created by society, and many of the issues I face are because of the way different situations are designed. So I need more thought out into how we design airflow in different spaces, but won’t go so far as to claim that my disability there is only based on how disability is treated.
Yeah, the aspie supremacists are quite cringe. Nothing is wrong with feeling empowered by your disability, the problem comes when you try and take it to the point of claiming that autism is a superpower.

I can totally understand how this reactionary ideology came about as a reaction to the demonization of autism by groups like Autism $peaks, but it is basically fighting fire with fire.

Saying ""autism isn't a disability"", is often said by people who forget entire segments of the autistic community that are definitely disabled by having autism. It's cool you're aspie and all but that doesn't mean there aren't people with higher support needs than you. That's basically what I would say to them.

It's also worth noting that aspie supremacy is also anti-disability pride, because aspie supremacy and declaring them to be not disabled is an attempt to distance themselves from the concept of disability. And that is something I simply refuse to accept. Aspie supremacists can do whatever they want... Over there... While the rest of us maintain disability solidarity and the idea that we need unity to stand together.

Neurodiversity is interesting because in a way it is a separate movement but it is alongside disability rights just with the addition of all mental health not just disabilities. Aspie supremacists try and claim the Neurodiversity movement for themselves occasionally but I oppose this strongly because solidarity is more important than *being right all the time.* If we have disagreements or different perspectives, we discuss them cleanly and productivity, we should never ever fight another comrade who believes in solidarity.

As we move forward and we start becoming more organised... We need to remember, what makes us strong is our differences, our experiences are all different, and we have so many unique perspectives. We would be a swiss army knife of an active movement. I hope one day we will be recognised alongside LGBT pride and other large movements. Because if we don't, we won't see the world we want to create.
* condition: we all have them. Nature of life, biodiversity and neurodiversity.
* impairment: if a condition cannot be treated and it leads to limitations in function.
* disability: when a condition or impairment reaches a barrier in home, society, workplace, and it prevents access to services, opportunity, and equity. The barrier in question is often there because of poor design or thoughtlessness of the functional authorities.

These are my definitions for them.

My autism is an impairment in some regards, but I do not consider it a disability (to me).

I am a disability advocate that helps push my policymakers to work better."
I reported my therapist today. Is he discriminating against me for being disabled?,171,disability,"First, I am so very, very sorry you were treated so horribly.  Therapy is supposed to be a safe place that supports, not causing more issues.  Second, your story is almost identical to mine.  I am a veteran and thought it was just the VA, but obviously, that’s not the case.  I have ptsd from a few sources, but the main one is literally from the way I am treated by medical staff.  I once had a dr fold her arms in front of her chest while listening to me beg for help with the pain, and she and her nurse LAUGHED at me.  My new psych told me that the reason I’m not getting mental health help is because of my attitude and the way I treat people.  I have been begging for therapy since I lost my therapist in October.  I was supposedly starting with a new therapist today, only to find out it’s just an intake, to see if/what I might qualify for.  I’ve had one of these at least 5 times in the past 6 months.  I could go on and on.  I understand😢. That said, never see this person again.  You are supposed to be comfortable with your therapist, that will never happen with this person.  Report them, contact the advocate, and keep looking for real help.  You did not do anything wrong, and you did not deserve this treatment.  I’m so very, very sorry you were traumatized by the very person who is supposed to be helping.
> Because of my mental health issues and/or medications, I seriously struggle with focus and memory. My wife helps me remember things and I rely on her to remember almost everything because I forget so much. If I don't write it down, it literally didn't happen.

I completely identify with that!  I've started asking my doctors if they're ok with me recording our appointments.  Not every provider is ok with it, which is why I always ask.  I've been recording my therapy sessions for years.  It's great because I don't have that anxiety around making sure I'm taking good notes or remembering every little thing that's said.  I think I've gone back and listened to... maybe 10% of the sessions?  But for those sessions, it's *very* helpful to have the recordings.

It's even better for medical appointments because I can focus on what the doctors are saying rather than worrying about trying to remember it all for later.  Again, I never do it without asking the doctor first and making sure everyone is ok with me recording them.  I explain that I have cognitive issues and auditory processing disorder - my therapist suggested I explain is an accommodation for my disability.  Most doctors are fine with it. Some are not.  I even had one doctor refuse to let me record the appointment, but then at the very end of the appointment he recorded a summary of his diagnosis and recommendations, which was better than nothing.
Good to know. My son is on SSDI and we are asked to list all providers he’s seen. 
I just thought it best to move on to another provider rather than have something negative he might write in the medical record. 
Mental health services in this country are very lacking and advocating for yourself can be very difficult. I wish him well.
It was just my take. You asked people if you should have reported him? I didn’t think you should. You will most  likely receive a letter dismissing you as a patient. 
I realize you no plan to see him again but it’s in your medical record now. Wish you the best. I understand how difficult it is to get good mental health care."
"This may be taboo for some, but why are disabled peopled people iften thought of as without sexual desire?",160,disability,"I'm a wheelchair user with MTM1 and am also overweight because of medications I take for nerve pain and mental health issues. It makes people wildly uncomfortable when my partner shows me affection in public. When he kisses me, rubs my back, etc, people look at him like he's some kind of pervert. It's really disheartening because I always feel like if I wasn't disabled, people wouldn't give us a second look, but because I am, it's like he's breaking some kind of social rules or something by treating me like a person that also feels love and sexual desires.
I'm 43/M with CP. The last intimate contact I had with a member of the opposite sex was at the age of 22.

The infantilization of the disabled is a real phenomenon. An interesting (but sad) side effect of that is the fact that it puts most sexual relationships off limits, too. I have never had any real luck with females, mostly because of a culture and social pressure that tells them they can ""do so much better"" than a person in my ""situation"". (I've been told that to my face, repeatedly.)


I'd like to have a life partner too, but I've come to the conclusion that some people can do relationships, while others cannot or will not. I know myself well enough that the repeated rejection (which nowadays is much more pointed and attack-oriented than 20 years ago) is not good for my mental health.

I've given up on looking for a partner because repeated rejection took a negative toll on my mental health. I'm a lot better now.

It is sad because I'm smart, good looking and have a professional job that affords me the ability to have nice things, but none of that really matters on the whole.

My weekends are taken up by religious pursuits and spectator sports on television.

Relationships for disabled people truly are ""The last taboo""."
Was I Wrong In How I Read This?,144,disability,"""In my opinion, my company relies on a third-party service to manage ADA accommodations and FMLA requests due to past legal issues. As a result, they require a certified letter from a doctor outlining the necessary workplace accommodations before extending a job offer to ensure compliance with ADA regulations.""
If you're saying that reading or watching a movie is a great activity to unwind, are you discriminating against blind people? 

If you're talking about your childhood experiences if you were not disabled back then, is it discriminatory against people who were born with a disability? 

We can't include all people all the time in our speech. Of course, if the context was a disability being discussed, then the comment was indeed not very smart. 

As I said, if the comment was meant as an ignorant advice to tell people that their disability could be fixed with some sport, yes, it is blatant ableism and highly disrespectful. But if it's just a ""Sport is good for health"" in general, it's just the truth.

Yeah, most days I can't do sports. And there are some days when I could, but I'm too scared to engage in physical activity. I can't run anymore, I can't walk for over 500m without having shaky legs and pain. But adapted exercise is objectively good and it's not ableism at all to say so, if you're not criticizing the person or diminishing their struggles.

Don't mix up shitty doctors who dismiss your symptoms by saying ""just exercise™"" and good doctors who say that some exercise depending on your ability will only be helpful. There is a reason why hospitals have physical therapists. Are physical therapists ableist?

We should rather denounce ableism that has actual ramifications. Workplace ableism, institutional ableism, doctors who don't trust their patients, etc. Here, in the worst case scenario, it's just a random redditor being ignorant."
I miss enjoying my free time,105,disability,"I don't honestly miss being busy, as my mental health recovers and I'm not dealing with a long term traumatic situation anymore I don't mind having the few hours when I'm not sick or sleeping open to just be and to do the things I want.

What I *do* miss is the *ability* to do things. I miss not only taking a full college courseload and learning but also being able to read more than one book in a week. I miss not just being able to run a 5k in 21 minutes but also being able to walk around the mall for however long I wanted without having serious repercussions the next few days. Hell, I miss when playing sims or going to the library or practicing flute wasn't an uphill battle just to *start*. 

I think that's the reason I do value my free time. Because I have a full time job just being sick and in pain from my disabilities, so the few hours I do have that I've managed to wrest from the hands of depression and anxiety and ADHD are *mine* and I deserve to have a chance to just exist and be happy, since I haven't had that chance for the past nearly 10 years.
That’s just shitty parenting. My child has some of the same mental health problems that I have. He is medicated and has been in therapy since 5 or 6. 

When your kid needs help, you get them help. Hard stop. To not do so is negligent."
Disability benefits in the United States,82,disability,"Lmao fuck that ableist, saneist nonsense.

People can be unable to work bc of mental health diagnoses, hi hello, as well as physical reasons. I have both. Even if my physical issues were magically cured I still would not be able to work bc I have meltdowns and crashes DAILY.

So no, how about we NOT gatekeep the miserable benefits available more than we already are?
So you don't think any mental health issues can be debilitating? You don't think people need their minds to work?

Mental illnesses ARE ""physical disabilities"". Your brain and body are a single organism.

Also, if we removed the cap on SS contributions then the program would have zero funding issues."
is it nonsensical that I feel solidarity with physically disabled people despite being able-bodied?,86,disability,"It makes sense to me!. Look when I was in the military there were people with physical disabilities and people with mental health issues. Those who had neither just classified us as ""broken"" . Harsh I know. We were singled out looked down upon and treated with condescension and contempt. I kinda see the rest of the world still treating us the same way.  I know it's a cynical point of view, but I feel we're in it together until things change. Our voices can amplify each other's"
My mum is convinced that my weight is the cause of my constant pain,50,disability,"It’s nothing to do with your weight, though weight does put extra strain on your organs which can be exacerbated by eds/hypermobility.

I have hypermobility, I am obese, I’ve also been underweight, I had no difference in pain levels(all over 35yrs old).

Hormones can affect pain so it’s worthwhile trying to see an Eds specialist to go over your pain and body and lifestyle.

I manage my condition in the gym, many edsers dont. I use splints and braces. I do this for my mental health as inactivity aggravates my mood (I don’t have depression).

Currently my ankle is not working, so I’m swimming without using my legs and using splints/braces on the gym equipment. This is reducing my weight. But not my pain levels.

I would recommend pressing for physio and pain management. 

Hope that helps a bit"
I am so tired of the demonetization of welfare.,42,disability,"It makes me very sad too, and I am glad to see I am not the only one that feels this way. Exactly on point you are! I do not know what the solution is but  was growing up, I remember things not being as hostile. People cared more. This whole idea of the “Welfare Queen” with an Escalade and designer handbags is what gets stuck in peoples heads. 


I am disabled for mental health reasons and reading this kind of stuff and hearing people say it, tends to make my panic/anxiety and depression issues worse! I have enough trouble going out of the house to get food as it is, I would like to not have to feel like I am being judged by the people in line or the cashiers when I slide the EBT card. It complicates my well being in other ways too…I constantly feel like I am some kind of worthless piece of crap and I just wish that feeling would stop. I wish I could stop caring what ignorant masses on the internet think but when you see so many people saying so many hurtful things, you start to become affected. I used to put people (politely) in their place but no more of that. Not anymore.. too draining. I even hate commenting on this post though I am glad to see someone else feels the same about this topic. 

It is also funny that hardly anyone commenting the hateful small minded things says that they were once a welfare recipient themselves.. It comes from those who do not have any direct knowledge or experience with it. "
I hate my dad,25,disability,"It’s setting boundaries. You can’t play with with me til you don’t hurt me. Plenty of people go no contact. Therapists sometimes recommend it. It’s mainly to safeguard your mental health not to change the other person. This father is doing damage to his child by trying to get them not to pay attention to their disability. Not to do self care, not to take care of themselves. That harms op. Should they have someone in their life that is actively stressing them out and trying to push themselves to exhaustion and possible physical harm? Hell no! Keep that out of your life. Set boundaries for that person bit them in a box where they can’t harm you. If it was a Boyfriend or girlfriend I would say breakup. But if it’s family you can go no contact."
"What's the Point in Feeling ""Better"" if you Can't DO Anything??",21,disability,"Oh okay I'm glad you have professionals you can talk to and trust. The first five years of my mental health treatment was categorized by incompetent doctors. It's not really until this last one that things started changing for me.

Texas... Ouch. Yeah I have never been and will never go there. I don't want anti everything conservatives making a kick back off of me. I hated Texas since I started doing more research on how they overuse the death penalty so much that it should really be in a failed state type setting. They fought like hell to not do DNA testing on death row inmates even though everyone knows what a Texas trial means. This was for people that were already on death row and they thought DNA would clear them, many were freed... Don't get me started on the new open carry, I might have to take out my ar-15 and 'shoot you in self defense with my nra approved hollow point bullets that pierce kevlar' jk jk but really...

I would really suggest NAMI then if you're already connected with health care professionals and it sounds like you're smart enough to not just take any drug they hand you. I truely hope the Wellbutrin works for you. It worked well for me but I had some side effects, but I did remember it helped a lot!

That's the thing though. You might not realize you're as depressed as you really are. Once you start feeling better you're life will start improving little by little. Eventually you might feel like you want to take the world by storm. If you start feeling this way please please run it by your treatment team before you make life changing decisions. I did stuff like moving to towns where I didn't know anyone trying to reset my life. Do not recommend doing that!"
Need advice and how to help someone without being an ableist jerk,19,disability,"This is not a disability issue, it is a behavior issue. She is physically violent, and verbally abusive - this is not okay anywhere, and certainly not in a workplace. By supporting this behavior the owner is contributing to the creation of a dangerous and toxic workplace. It is a harassment suit waiting to happen. The owner is failing the entire workforce. 

Disability is not a free pass to being an asshole. Honestly, stories like this are damaging to the whole community as they are used to justify not hiring folks who have disability but would meaningfully contribute if allowed reasonable accommodations.
I feel like this person shouldn't be allowed to drive? Or be at a workplace? Since she deliberately puts people at risk and hurts them in these situations? 

Disability isn't a free pass to be abusive and get away with it giggling. 9-12 year olds know that hurting people and animals is wrong. Even toddlers know that it's wrong. If she truly doesn't understand that, she shouldn't be in a work environment putting people in danger, or driving a car. But it sounds like she does know, and just wants to take advantage of the fact that she gets to enjoy a double standard. This is an incredible disservice to all the other people who have to suffer the owner's failure to grow a backbone and protect the workers from an abusive colleague.
This isn't a safe working situation for you and it doesn't sound like it's a safe one for her either. 

You should not be abused in your workplace, regardless of who is doing it. Teachers have every right to refuse actual children who are attacking them. Heck if somehow a literal baby was abusing a staff member and hurting them they would also be booted from the nursery. 

You never have to accept abuse just because somebody doesn't know better. 

Them having cognitive issues gives them the accommodation of you not hitting them back, not of you keeping on accepting their abuse. 


I would talk to your boss and tell them the same thing. That they don't have to continue employing somebody who is abusing their staff and creating a hostile work environment. And actually that they shouldn't. Because by trying to accommodate this one person they are entirely neglecting the rest of their employees. 


Besides it doesn't sound like this person is safe in your workplace if they amputated a digit. That's a huge safeguarding issue if somebody working there is not able to understand that risk. God forbid they hurt somebody else to that extent. Kicking an already injured leg is bad enough.
It is not ableist to expect a disabled employee to adhere to the same standards of conduct and courtesy as a non-disabled employee.    The goal of the ADA and other non-discrimination laws is to level the playing field and treat disabled employees equally, not give preferential treatment to disabled employees.   Yes, a disabled employee is entitled to reasonable accommodations, but the key word here is ""reasonable"".

It is not reasonable to allow a disabled employee to harass, bully, or physically strike out at other employees.  This also ignores the duty of care you have to other employees.   It is not reasonable to basically allow one employee to run roughshod over everyone else and not face consequences.  It is ableist to assume she is incapable of controlling her behavior or shouldn't have consequences.

You are sending mixed signals when you don't correct her firmly every time her behavior is unacceptable or she uses physical violence, because you're afraid of making her mad or hurting her feelings.   ""Rarely"" addressing her behavior, letting her hit AT ALL, or backing down because she throws a tantrum just sends the message that she can get away with doing these things.  She doesn't know where the boundaries are because you keep redrawing the lines.

Develop an employee code of conduct.  Put clear expectations in writing and have everyone sign it so she isn't singled out.  Then enforce it, consistently, every single time.

And some things should be ZERO tolerance regardless of her level of cognitive ability.  Treating an animal or child roughly; hitting or striking another employee; threatening physical violence.  That behavior would not be accepted in any other employee - stop accepting it from her.   If your boss is unwilling to make the hard choices here, point out to him that he's been lucky not to have been sued already, and at some point, his luck is going to run out.

I assume you are in the U.S. - in which case you're very lucky not to have been investigated for OSHA violations if the amputated digit was a workplace incident.   If this employee has the cognitive level of a child and her employers know this, allowing her anywhere near dangerous equipment is reckless at best, and willful endangerment at worst.

A local mom and pop grocery in my area got slapped with a significant fine for allowing an ID employee to operate a meat slicing machine in their deli.   The employee was injured - the work comp doctor reported it to the state as an occupational safety violation - and the state occupational safety board agreed.
And why does she come back every time? 

She needs proper help and not a workplace."
Reported and filing complaint about hospital discriminating me because of past mental health history...,19,disability,"I definitely will!  I know there may be no outcome here or for the personal doctors, but I will go publicly out with this and start something to help others feel heard.  I shouldn't be punished for needing physical Healthcare because of a mental health disability.  No one should.  I understand concern for attention seeking behavior, but it shouldn't make doctors mock patients."
How do I stop myself from isolating?,17,disability,"Hi there, no you aren't overreacting.

You recently just started using a wheelchair and that can take a while to get used to, both physically and mentally.

It's normal to feel a certain type of way.

Have you considered speaking with a mental health therapist?

You are currently going through a big change in your life and talking to one may be helpful if not for anything else, you get to have a neutral person with who you can pour out your emotions and feelings without feeling like you are troubling them."
A doctor told me to just exercise more because I don't want to be off work and poor?,13,disability,"Just so you know, telling people to exercise more and lose weight is standard practice for doctors. I'm sorry that it was so harmful in your case.. sounds like you may have something serious.

I do think this kind of comment will vary from doctor to doctor. Was the MRI helpful at all?

I also may have had a stroke around 2010-2011 but never had the MRI to check. Still have symptoms over a decade later, which never improved. I was able to get on SSDI, but *only* because I have mental health issues as well. Unfortunately, their requirements for a physical disability are  extraordinarily high, and most people are rejected."
Suggestions for Newly Paralyzed—Please Help!!,11,disability,Please help him get access to mental health therapy if he's not in one already/support groups. These changes can take a toll on one's mental health.
Anyone else receiving pain management treatment that comes across kind of gaslighty?,8,disability,"Yes absolutely. I've had my pain treated like an emotional problem before. It's even worse if people already think of you as emotional (I feel like women get this a lot more, but also people with certain disabilities and mental health problems and probably many others).

Once I injured my ankle (which was entirely caused by my disability), but unlucky for me, I was already labelled as anxious and difficult. So they didn't treat it, but gave me an emotions traffic light card, and sat me on a chair in the corner. For the whole day, with no way of getting up or asking for help. Thankfully, I'm not in that place anymore, but I worry about the people who are. I'm still emailing people about that.

Pain is there for a reason. Sometimes it is helpful to pay attention to it, sometimes it is not. Personally, I *need* to work on paying attention to my pain, because it keeps me safe. I've ignored fairly significant injuries because pain is normal for me. I'd love to live without it, but it's not an attitude problem that I can't."
Client is emotionally dependent on us personal care assistants,7,disability,"I see that and acknowledge that. Thing is, we are with him 8-12h every day and in order to do our job professionally some sort of boundaries need to be in place. 

We are to be friendly and understanding with our clients but we are not to replace a social circle, friends, family. The reasons for that are the possibility of burnout on our end, or depression if a client passes away. On the other hand, when a client is emotionally dependent on us and too attached there is danger of abuse, I have heard of cases like this in health care, when caretakers take advantage of someone. 

Furthermore, would you really like a caretaker / assistant to not assist but rather influence your life to the point you feel lost and helpless when you are without them? Wouldn’t it be much better if you would let an assistant help you with your daily tasks while being as self sufficient as possible? Having real Friends of your own? If you feel blue and don’t know what to do with yourself, wouldn’t you want to talk to a professional about it and work on it with them? We are not psychologists or social workers and not only may we not provide such help because we aren’t trained in it, it is highly unadvised to do all this, we simply lack the expertise. 

I can’t be an assistant, a motherly figure, a buddy, a psychiatrist, a chef, a comedian, expert for official affairs, the person who cleans you or gives you a respirator while also being an entertainer, nobody can be all that at once. I saw too many colleague’s quit this occupation due to burnout. Boundaries can start to blur when you are so close to someone all day every day, but we really gotta be careful that this doesn’t happen. The social aspect and the mental health aspect as well as the physical / psychological aid, those are tasks that need to be spread and shared among people. All clients except for him understand that. I want him to not dread being with himself for a bit and to find something for himself that makes him happy. My clients can’t be my friends. Happened to me once and when he died I was broken for months. We are friendly, but I could quit this job tomorrow or he could get fewer hours of PCA next year. I might be replaced by someone who isn’t as chatty and he becomes lost and depressed. Or someone who is SO friendly, it’s borderline grooming. God forbid any of our clients crave so much closeness they end up being taken advantage of. 

So to answer your question, it’s not too much of him to crave human connection. However, there is a reason why in society we have several roles that are separate. Your wife can’t be your mother, your workmate can’t be your psychiatrist outside of working hours, you can’t be romantic with your children. We try all we can to encourage him and take opportunities that are available to him so that he can live a fulfilling life, but he denies. He wants to rely on us playing all the roles in his life. I can’t do this, and I am not the only one."
