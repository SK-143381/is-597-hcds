"*TW: mental health, suicide* - I need unbiased help from someone who has gone through something similar.",9,EstrangedAdultChild,"As you said you are thriving living at your boyfriends.  Being in a small town must be difficult as rumors tend to spread pretty quickly.  As another poster stated they are being incredibly ableist.  You are not mentally ill due to who you date.  As far as you making your family ill, that‚Äôs not the case either.  My parents have definitely tried that as well.  My stepmother would think that if I spent more time around my dad his depression would be cured.  Despite me having years of clinical knowledge of mental health and experience in the field, they didn‚Äôt take anything of what I said seriously.  Actually the last straw for me was that when my fiance finally confronted my parents about how they have not been involved in my life their excuse was because my dad has depression.  When pointed out that I have had my fair share of mental health issues their response was well he has it worse üôÑ Honestly I think they are both miserable and angry and just want to bring other ppl down.  It sounds like the same for your family.  Keep thriving and know that you are not the cause of someone else‚Äôs mental health issues."
Reflections from Recovery -  A Very Long Post,28,antidietglp1,"First of all, I'm so happy you are doing well in your recovery!!!¬† Secondly, thanks so much for posting this! I resonate with so much of what you're saying, with regards to eating disorder recovery, the benefit of a care provider who gets it, and especially in how it's possible to use GLP-1 medication in a way that is not harmful to those of us in recovery! It's so important.¬† I hope that you'll continue to post here. I think this is a really important conversation. The distinction you're getting to between intentional weight loss for eating disorder reasons vs health reasons is a really tricky one, and needs a lot of work from mental health professionals. I'm hopeful that more awareness of the biological basis for metabolic disorders, which these medications are accelerating in our society, will help with our understanding and ability to successfully treat eating disorders, as well.¬†"
Toronto expands community-led mental health crisis service citywide,52,toronto,"so... after the crisis is over, where does the care part factor in?

Access to ongoing mental health services is, politely, not good.
You get connected to Case Management which is not only mental health services- it's support with housing, employment, physical health, peer relationships, and whatever other goals the person has."
Need input from UK mental health professionals: A person in the  middle of mental health crisis assaulted me. Do I press criminal charges?,6,AskUK,"The problem with mental health support in this country is that they will flat out refuse to help anyone until they ""hurt themselves or others"" which to me is fucking stupid. 

You should report them immediately and they will hopefully get the help they need. You're doing a good thing if you report them so don't worry about it.
You don‚Äôt ‚Äòpress charges‚Äô in the uk. You alert the authorities and they make an educated decision on how to proceed. One of those routes will be to get them the mental health support they need.

You would be doing the correct thing to report them.
Yes absolutely you should.

First, if people are in the middle of a crisis, they still need repurcutions for their actions. If only just to push them to solve their issues.

But really, it should be up to the courts to decide their punishment and if this really was down to a mental health issue then they'll be pushed to fix that. The courts may determine they're not safe to others too and may be taken away from people. Because while tragic and terrible it might be for them, the simple matter is they can't go around attacking people and if they're going to do it again they need to be put somewhere where they can be helped but also not be a danger to others.

Their mental health issues won't be of much concern to the friends and family of a fatal attack victim.

If I was going to be a danger to people, I'd want to be put in a hospital or wherever. It could even be my own loved ones that I'd attack and the last thing I want is to be roaming around a danger to people. I would want to get the help I need and going through the courts is a way of getting that.
Yes because its the right thing to do, and may mean that the person can access forensic mental health services.
Not a legal mental health professional but I've dealt with the police in regards to mental health issues and they were never great. 

I'm not a full on religious hippy turn the other cheek kind of guy, I do believe vengeance isn't always a bad thing, some people will never learn and often a kick in the teeth is the only thing they understand and the best form of justice anyone's ever going to get when some waste of spaces are involved....

That being said, I don't view our legal system as a punishment system, I try to view it as a necessary evil in some cases, and a possible path to rehabilitation in best cases. 


All you have to ask yourself is, will pressing charges against this person improve their situation in the long term, or keep others safe?

If the answer to both those questions is no, you're left only with vengeance, and does that person deserve to at least suffer for what they did.

If criminal charges aren't going to help them sort their issues out, they aren't a threat to others so the charges won't keep others safe, and you at the very least won't feel good about getting them punished, what's even left to ask.

That‚Äôs crisis support mainly. But yeah there is a culture of ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt help until you‚Äôve proved you‚Äôre a danger to yourself or others‚Äù. 

General mental health support, i.e. therapy, for those not in crisis is free on the NHS and anyone can refer.
Not necessarily the right call. I know a lady who suffers with mental health issues and was mid flashback when a police officer tried to intervene. She panicked and attacked him and now has assaulting an officer on her criminal record. She's trying to get out of a domestic abuse situation which is aggravating her mental health but nowhere will take her because of her record.

This person needs medical help, not punishment."
Almost at breaking point.,8,CaregiverSupport,"Most older people resist going to any facility, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do for themselves or for their loved ones. Why does he think it's ok for you and your sibling to be cleaning up after his messes? He's not entitled to that from his children, and this must be causing a massive strain and stress for both of you. You have numerous mental health issues, and he is not thinking about you. Because of that you will have to lay down some boundaries and protect yourself (same goes for your sister). That may be hard, but it's not your fault because he should be thinking about the well-being of his children, not forcing them to make extreme sacrifices. There's also the issue of a fall when no one is home, and that could be catastrophic. Anyhow, people here end up suicidal, and often older people are just not considering their impact on others. That's why I'm encouraging you to do what you need for your own sanity, and secondarily what might keep him safe and comfortable."
Has this injury impacted your mental health?,17,AchillesRupture,"At the start was ok, when I was on crutches I found walking around was a decent workout, the crap time for me was about week 12 - 20. I‚Äôm almost at 5 months and started jogging running a bit -makes a huge difference . I was really frustrated before and sport is so important to my mental health
Almost identical: first game in ~10y, didn‚Äôt make it to half time üò£. July 12th, just this week starting to walk without a boot. In contrast to some others, I‚Äôm a very active runner (marathons, etc) and it still happened to me so if you‚Äôre feeling guilty about ‚Äútrying to do too much‚Äù it‚Äôs maybe true but also maybe not. No reason to beat yourself up. 
Mental health part is also no joke and been a big struggle for me too. Trying to remember the only way forward is through and it WILL get better"
Positive male spaces that exist,224,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,"First off with this tweet it doesn't make sense. Why does something need to happen for male mental health to be important? Men create their own spaces and they get shut down. Lack of male spaces doesn't mean male mental health isn't important. It is important but isn't viewed that way as they get sacrificed for women. 

This tweet just seems like a way to shame men and treat them as lesser. To instil into them to care more about women's issues than their own. ""You shouldn't care about mens mental health because it's worse for women"". The person behind the tweet seemingly got triggered that any amount of care would go to men and needs to diminish it. Instead of thinking oh people need help they think men need help and men are bad they hurt people why should we help them.
You‚Äôre welcome. I found it from here I think. My experiences with other mental health & abuse support stuff makes me avoid checking out CPTSD because I expect a lot of misandry & defending abusive women (the people who abused me were mostly female), and that puts me in a worse mental state."
My (35f) relationship with my wife(36f) changed since I gave birth. I don't know how to get it back ,36,relationships,"Sounds like you both need a break from parenthood and some good old-fashioned therapy. Parenting is tough, especially for first-time parents, and it can take a toll on even the strongest relationship. Hang in there and remember that you are both doing your best. And for anyone else reading this, don't forget to take care of your own mental health as well!"
