Taking the mystery out of traveling alone,28,Blind," This is great!
Have you had or will you get orientation and mobility lessons?"
Weight lifting is one of the best sport for people with a visual disability,37,Blind,"I agree.  With that said there are a few exercises I was curious about given I can't see videos and demonstrations.  If you were to explain to someone blind what is or how to do the skull crusher exercise how would you describe it?  Thanks in advance, hear this exercise is great.
For allthe people that talked about the fact that weight lifting is not recommanded for people with a glaucoma :

  
First of all yes, you should always ask your ophtalmologist before starting any new program/sport

  
I did that with two differents doctors and both told me that the small increase in the IOP due to the weight lifting/exersise wasn't something dangerous, that you can lift weight  without any issue but you should just try to avoid exersises where  you are on your head, so basically just the handstand push up in our case
Weight lifting alone could get boring, I speak from my experience. The best, in my opinion is to lift then use it in an active sport or marshal art. Every week you’ll feel stronger and more capable. For me, I lift 1 or 2 times a week and train BJJ twice a week. And do blind hockey on a biweekly basis on the weekends. I speak from my experience,  everyone is different.
Hey, I also have glaucoma and am quite into fitness.

I tried lifting weights for a while too, but i found it kind of boring. It is nice to get into, but it eventually gets boring when you realize the only thing you can do is put on more weights. Maybe that floats your boat, but I personally didn't find it fulfilling enough.

  
I started calisthenics though, and I have found so much more motivation to do my workouts. It feels so much more satisfying to learn how to do a skill like L-sit from the ground, toes to bar, pistol squat and pseudo planche pushup. Those are just kind of beginner moves, I want to progress into the even more cool ones. You do need a bar though, preferably one for pullups/hanging.

As for the people saying it is dangerous to do lifts due to spikes in IOP. I think there is definitely merit. I think the best way to keep yourself safer in that context is to never over-strain yourself (close your eyes tightly because it is too hard), always maintain your breathing, and of course never do handstands. That is the one thing that I really wish I could do is handstands, because the handstand pushups and presses are so cool.
Yes, weight lifting can cause IOP spikes. Aerobic exercise is more recommended for glaucoma/ocular hypertension.
Then the problem of going to a gym is finding someone that will go through the trouble of explaining new workouts well. IDK why but most people seem very shy and awkward doing that lol."
Handling Mean Comments About My Disability,48,Blind,"Aw you are really going through it.  Some crappy people are doing a very good job of making you feel like a laughingstock, which by the way you are not.  I know the school has responsibilities to encourage you to be independent, but they don't seem to have the full picture.  

I was resistant to starting to use a mobility cane myself, I was already anxious being in public and the cane made that feeling worse.  Like you, I've walked into things and smacked my head into immovable objects.  That ghot me thinking about the kinds of risks I now face in terms of personal injuries.  This became a more pressing concern after I hurt my shoulder walking into a bike I didn't know was there.    If I keep hitting my head, there's the possibility I could break my nose.  I personally like my nose the way it is, so I started making changes that dropped the opportunity for injuries.  Mishaps I was having one out of every ten times I did something, I worked to drop that to one out of every hundred times, or once every thousand times.  If I'm walking at speed and miss a curb, that can result in dental damage I'm similarly not interested in experiencing, same as with breaking my nose.  

Like I said, you're dealing with a huge amount of concerns and fears.  You're a teen, you're dealing with decreasing sight, and those are two scary things imo.  Has your school already opened a conversation of ways to accommodate your situation?  They will be concerned about students who have been left to fend for themselves the way you kind of are describing, they will be concerned if you are injured on their property and it's later revealed they dropped the ball and did not intervene with proven resources to help you.  

It's really great how you described the way you feel and what your experiences are.  That is a really good skill.  You raise a lot of really good points; maybe consider showing or sharing this post with one of your parental figures as a starting point?  It sounds like you underwent a lot of sight loss in a relatively short time; having gone through less sight loss than you, I found my brainpower took a big hit because all the formerly visual pathways needed to reroute the circuitry for the change in conditions.  If your school has learning support services, I would expect this is something they are trained to work with.

The people who are mean and enjoy punching down on others, they are a vocal minority, do your best to tune them out, they are really unimportant.  You will meet plenty of people who are impressed with your strength and resilience.  You also may grab the attention of the adult version of the folks who like punching down on others; let your expeirences with them in school help further temper your risk assessment.
1) You need to confront the people responsible head-on. I was bullied in grade school (for something other than blindness). I finally “snapped” one day and shouted “Stop it!  You think it’s cool to pick on me because I can’t defend myself?!”  I said it LOUD. Everyone in the cafeteria stopped talking and looked over. It definitely got the teachers’ attention and they had to acknowledge there was a problem. 
2) Report the issue to the teachers and staff. Part of their job is to keep you safe. 
3) Work on building your confidence and poise. If your body language screams “victim” you will be victimized. If you can, participate in a sport or marshal arts. It will improve the way you carry yourself and balance."
I'm trying to locate a physical calendar that can read aloud,3,Blind,"i’m completely blind, I live by myself, I use my phone as a calendar, and my Alexa, because I also have to set reminders in my Alexa, so I can make sure I call from my Transportation for pair of transit, for my doctors appointment, on the days I’m supposed to call for them. It’s really wonderful. I am 64 years young."
Anyone move to somewhere for public transit?,30,Blind,"I have RP and so does my cousin. I strictly live in large cities with public transport and would never live anywhere I couldn’t get around myself. I am comfortable with the cane at night when needed. I am very much happy being independent but do rely on others for certain things. 

Conversely, my cousin also has RP and lives in a rural area close to family. He is not happy and often finds himself frustrated by having to rely on others for almost everything. He doesn’t seem as happy and doesn’t know how to use the cane.
I fully moved countries for the public transportation.  Although originally I was interested in the country I'm living in for other reasons, what changed my mind about staying permanently rather than come for short visits was the freedom I found here that I had never experienced before.  

To be fair though, I couldn't say I really *fully* enjoyed living in the US because, y'know, I was never going to be able to live independently.
Following this thread, wondering the same thing as I plan to move soon due to vision loss and want to maintain independence through public transportation 
I also have RP, and post-undergraduate degree have lived multiple places where having public transportation/walkability was one of my top priorities. My position is different than yours, as I was legally blind by 18 and had to make these decisions as a young adult rather than an established adult with working vision, but from my experience, I would absolutely recommend moving somewhere/living somewhere with public transportation that  allows you to be as autonomous as possible. I would never consider moving somewhere where I can’t be independent and navigate, at this point in my life
Paratransit in some progressive cities are getting better when they utilize the micro transit services sometimes offered by third-party, subcontracted programs that are not the clunky short buses they pick you up within a 30 minute window and then you can be on the bus for up to 60 minutes each way. Again, the micro transit would be a city where UZURV or via transportation operates.
This is a deeply personal decision! I am totally blind and have had made every choice about where I live based on public transportation. I live in a big city and bought a condo less than a block walking from the nearest subway stop. For me, paratransit is not really a functional option Because it is so unreliable and can take so long   Also, for what it's worth I find it easier to make friends in big cities because there are just so many people around
Where are these places y’all live with public transportation and walkable places? I’m in the same position and trying to move.
Have you reached out to a local blind organization? Maybe they will have strict strategies in orientation and mobility for navigating your specific area. I cannot promise you strategies will work for you/be affective but they would be the best people to ask. Especially because I bet you are not the only blind person in your area to have that same kind of issue
I live in Massachusetts in a suburb of Boston. There's decent public transportation and Boston is a pretty walkable city. Many of the suburbs have commuter rails and busses, and all public transportation is free for the blind. I also get subsidized $40/day in Uber or Lyft rides, if I need it. This is all through the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. I am very recently legally blind so I haven't actually utilized some of the benefits yet. I just got an electric bike and that's been really helpful. The only setback is that it's a HCOL area.
I also have RP, and grew up in a very rural area. I feel for your cousin, after growing up I immediately moved to areas that are walkable and have public transportation/are more urban, and have a much higher quality of life. Rural living can be challenging for anyone, but from my experience it’s just not feasible for anyone who is blind/low vision.
> Rural living can be challenging for anyone, but from my experience it’s just not feasible for anyone who is blind/low vision.

I am in my 40s and have never been able to drive. Since becoming an adult I have spent half my time in a large suburban town with no public transport and half my time in a small rural town with no public transport. If I had to choose I would say the rural town was better. It was walkable and had bike lanes and sidewalks and people I knew that would give me a lift in the pouring rain. The suburan town had no sidewalks, no bike lanes, and everything was miles apart.

For the first time in my life I have access to public transit and I still want to cry with happiness everytime I can choose to go somewhere and really be independent but it's still a limited service that doesn't give me the same freedom as a large metropolitan transit service.

I think that we are less limited by geography an more limited by car centric locations and lack of full services and lack of connected communities."
"Visually impaired and losing sight - MO, US",10,Blind,"if you were declared legally blind by your state. Your first step should be contact department of Blind services in your county, they will then turn you case to let’s say maybe lighthouse or something similar like that where they do classes to teach independence for the blind, and they could assist you with mobility training, the way that you specifically would need it. That’s where I suggest you start. It is just my opinion. I’ll be praying."
What the hell am i?,33,Blind,"I agree with everybody else. I am blind, I have no usable vision whatsoever in my eyes. The right eyesight is gone, from a stroke when I was but say about seven years ago, I’m 64. I have a four multiple brain aneurysms, my eyesight has slowly been going for over 40 years. I am now I am blind, I live by myself, I take mobility lessons to walk back-and-forth to the stores, I can walk back-and-forth to the post office. your best bet is to contact the division of Blind service, make sure you have paperwork from the eye doctor, and they will start helping you, look for places that you can go for independent living, braille, most of all mobility training. Whether I’m blind or not, I love my life. I wouldn’t change it for a minute."
Am I holding my visually impaired younger brother back?,15,Blind,"When you are in the workforce as a blind person, unless you are working  from home, you need a good amount of determination.

Between having to make adjustments any time something changes in the place, staying on top of transportation, and all the other BS, there is a lot of extra effort we make.

Unless you got the determination and a set of clear goals that you want for yourself, a sustained career of any sort is pretty unlikely.

You and your mom are talking about your brother like you are discussing how to place the new couch in the living room.

I am sorry to say that if you are at the point of asking others for help with your brother's direction in life and it does not occur to you to think of his opinion one time while writing  the post, then neither piece of advice is gonna do anything for him."
Learning to use a cane before O&M,12,Blind,"if you would like to talk about how to use a cane before, you actually get orientation and mobility training, send me a private message, and I can try and help you out."
"I need help.  Blind since birth, 55F, alone, need a reason.  My life has been pointless.  Not suicidal, just alone, grieving, kinda rich, confused, no kids, I live very rural, and I'm just out of ideas on what to do with my meaningless life.",9,Blind,"Move to a city. You say you got the money for it so go for it, buy a place, then you can perhaps look into these blind organisations in America, then maybe sports, you could try rock climbing, cooking, force yourself to go to events youmay not  want to, put it this way, you can sit and be sad  in your house, or you can get out off of  your arse and try and live.
 I’ve been completely blind, my entire life, might I suggest learning to do things non-visually, because I feel like you’re limiting yourself by the small amount of vision that you do have. I know you mentioned you don’t like gardening, but have you thought of doing things like, making your own jams? I do think some therapy might help, just to help out with the grieving. I too lost a parent. The reason why I say learn to do things non-visually is because I am completely blind, and I have done plenty of sports in my life, as well as dance, and a few other things that you mentioned that you said blind people couldn’t do.   a change of location might do you some good. It will give you a fresh start, and it certainly helped me when I lost my parent at the age of 19. Perhaps take up some thing like cooking or baking? Origami is also very interesting, you can get into LEGO building, all these things are accessible for blind people nowadays. In fact, there’s a whole world of accessible things for blind people nowadays.  You’re never too old to go back to school.   Also, what’s this about having a rich man to support you? I want one of those? Ha ha… Seriously was that  something your parents told you you needed?
Maybe you can try an AirBNB in a few different cities and see if you like any of them? I don’t know what the lower age limit is, but there are pretty awesome bus tours set up for retirees that take you all around the country. Might be a way to travel and meet new people. I can appreciate that it might feel too hard to leave given how many animals you have, but maypbe you can use that money to hire someone you trust to look after them.

There are also some organizations that do blind events, like my relative who did blind golfing and glind skiing. I myself don’t have the money to go do a specialized trip like this for blind people, but this sort of adventure does exist out there for us. 

The loneliness and the high value you put on being with people in real life really stands out from what you wrote. It would be uncomfortable at first, but maybe you can find some achievable goals on the path toward including more people in your life. This sort of thing doesn’t pay off right away, but you have time to include more people in your life, maybe through travel or relocation. Maybe you can afford to have a house in town and one in the country. You could alternate lifestyles. There is a lot more occupationsl therapy and mobility training in town centers if that’s an issue. I love the app “voicevista” for exploring new places. It even tells me when there’s a drinking fountain nearby, and identifies a lot of the buildings and parks that I’m passing.

I’d say a goal in my life is to do enough things that I have crazy stories to tell afterward. I have social anxiety, but sometimes this goal is enough to get me out of the house."
Is there technology that can help us learn how to dance?,3,Blind,"I would say this is a very good opportunity to talk to your friends, see if anyone is interested in teaching. Further, a quick dancing lesson from a professional can help allot provided they understand your requirement correctly.

No tech product can come closer to that feeling of dancing with someone, enjoying the moment, the human touch.

I did think about GPT 4O, but it is yet to be in consumer's hands, and I wouldn't suggest doing any physical activity with that thing just yet, getting injured is a high probability. Look up GPT 4O on Google if you don't know what it is. It was announced on May 13th 2024."
What is your mission in life?,6,Blind,"As someone who loves languages, math, and puzzles, I’ve found learning braille to be really rewarding (after a learning curve at the start). I had a bit of vision left and was able to memorize the characters visually very quickly, but it took a while for my fingertips to re-wire. Anyway, I think just having something that I’m gaining, instead of everything that I’m losing or that’s getting harder, has helped lift a bit of depression that had the world and all my goals cast in a shadow.

Braille displays also have their own word processors so I’m hoping that will help me as I edit a novel I wrote.

I get what you’re saying, though. I too have a job that was more interesting to me when I could just sail through it. Now I think about quitting every day. I find it so stressful to use screenreaders on a laptop, but I find voiceover with an Ipad to be ok for somethings. I like how I can use gestures instead of memorizing a million key combinations that you can‘t even perform properly with fingers at home position. (For example, control and the letter “q“ at the same time to exit NVDA, when both of these buttons are used with the left pinkie finger. If only I had two left pinkie fingers, I guess.)

Anyway, a lot of  blind coders use braille to code. I find that braille activates my visual cortex and I sort of see the words I’m reading. Maybe that would be more rewarding for you.

If you are patient and enjoy teaching, you could look into joining an assistive tech service (probably state occupational services) for the blind. Then you’d have motivation to learn the tools since you’d be teaching them to others. As I’ve met more and more older blind people, I find that there are many who haven’t gotten very far with learning to use phones or computers and could really get some functionality back just learning and practicing the basics like emailing and texting and being able to chagne the speaking rate and turn the screen reader off and on. I enjoy teaching an older friend how to use voiceover on her phone, but it does take a lot of patience and repetition. 

I love exercise and I’m looking to get a guide dog that the trainer has agreed to teach to run. It‘s a small company though, and they might not have all the dogs for the demand. 

I do a bit of running independently with a white cane and high-mileage roller ball tip. I also am getting back into practicing soccer with a bell-ball. Exercise does help with the dark haze of depression that I”m always fighting off. It doesn’t quite lift it enough for me to want to try hard at work though. Maybe I just need another job for that.
Keep your options open for OSes. Having both Windows and Mac machines, or a dual-boot Mac is a good choice. Some time ago my work machine was a dual-boot MacBook since I was developing for Windows and for Mac at the same job.

For writing, consider using a dictation app and then having the recording converted to text. I'm sighted, but I use speech to text regularly, especially when I'm walking or driving a familiar route. 

For OS control there's a new app called Cephable you might want to check out. Just a week and a half I attended a conference where Cephable presented, and it looks like the software could fill in the gaps not address by JAWS and NVDA. During a short chat with the founder I asked if the software could be adapted to find and dismiss modal dialogs, and he said it could, though it's unclear to me whether that would entail additional work. In the presentation he mostly emphasized accessibility for people with limited mobility. At some point I'll create a post about it. 

MIght I try to convince you to reconsider coding? Software management and project management are options, but ticket trackers are a mixed bag when it comes to accessibility. My team and I settled on Jira but needed to tweak it. If the key barrier to keeping and maintaining an interest in coding is accessibility, then that's something we could discuss."
What do you guys do forexercise?  ,14,Blind,"I used to go on very long – as in 6-8 miles long – guide dog walks. I’d just start off somewhere, drop a waypoint in my GPS app and walk. We’d often get lost, but that was the idea.

Sadly the dog got older and I got a lung disease. It got to the point where bending down to pick something up from the ground caused me to need to sit for a while, which was dreadful.
Now I use an exercise bike; I either make a playlist of songs for a set timed workout, or my book player can pause between chapters, so I look at the timings of those and tend to go time over distance. Sometimes I will use my Fitbit when cycling to compete with my family, particularly if my daughter’s doing some other sort of sporting activity.

I play tennis once a week, swim when I can, walk the dogs, and that’s about it really. I have no desire to be overly buff and nobody to buddy with at a gym anyway, so I just have to take things as they are. I average about 10,000 steps a day, although on a quiet workday that’ll be 4,000 and during a cycling session it might hit 12,500 or something. I also tend to pace about a lot to think or when I’m on a phone call or meeting where I don’t need to type; I’ve done at least a mile just going round and round my garden.
There’s usually tons of camps for blind kids in the summer. I wish tgere were more for adults haha. 

I try to walk and do my physical therapy exercises but I’m pretty cooped up and sedentary myself.
I mostly work out at home with a Nintendo Switch game called Ring Fit Adventure, which I started using before I went blind. It is a fantastic fitness game with a wide range of workout options, and I loved it until my vision loss started.

However, its visual accessibility is on par with your average video game produced in 2018, so… not great. I can still do it because I learned all the moves with normal vision, but I have a lot of problems with obstacles that I can’t see anymore, and it gets harder and harder as my vision loss continues to progress slowly.

I have been thinking about getting a stationary bike and listening to audiobooks while I cycle.
Primarily weight lifting and walking. I dearly miss cycling (tandem is not an equivalent). 

I've both a home gym and gym membership down the road, but primarily workout at home. Absolutely *love* weight lifting.
As someone else mentioned there are lots of camps and organized things for kids, at least there are here in Michigan, I'd be happy to recommend some specific ones if you happen to here.  

I am visually impaired and my duaghter is blind but we are very active reguardless.    We both run, bike, swim, ski (downhill and cross country), kayak and lots more.  We use a combination of different strategies to make things work for us, its all totally possible.   If anyone wants to talk about specific activities I'd be happy to talk.  

Specifically for workouts / training there is an app called Revision Fitness that was developed specifically for blind users.  It's great.  The person who started is a blind Paralympic athlete so he know his stuff.
Our local blind club is looking to get a swishboard. It’s sort of a mix between ping-pong and air hockey, and there is a blinder in the middle so that sighted people can play with blind people without having to wear a blindfold.

If you live in a big place, you might look into goalball. It’s an indoor soccer-like game made for blind people and all the sighted ones wear blindfolds.

  
I go on long walks every day, and when the path is empty, I run for portions using my white cane. I also have to do a lot of stretch band exercises for a surgery rehab.

In the pool, I often do water jogging with one of those floaty belts that people use in water aerobics. You can get a pretty good workout without moving forward all that quickly. That gives people time to get out of my way. (I don’t do this in lanes, but in the open swim area. If I get an empty lane all to myself, I’ll mix this with regular swimming.)

I’ve been riding a tandem bike, and it’s alright. I also go paddleboarding, but almost always with a sighted person. 

I have lived in one place where there was a group that offered sighted guides for exercise for blind people. I don’t live in the right part of Australia, but there are a few places with organisations dedicated to helping blind people do sport.

Maybe start by looking up if there is swishboard or goalball in your area.
I do have some vision.

I like to ice skate, and I used to go once a week until I broke my arm last year (I'm. A little scared to go again haha). A couple of months ago, I got a tricycle, and it's been really great. There's a bike path along the beach near my house. I got it because you need to go fast on a bike to stay balanced - too fast for me to be able to see. So the trike is really nice because I'm balanced and I can go as fast or slow as I need to. It's so much more fun than walking  I'm thinking of making a vest to let others know I have low vision, since I can't have my cane out obviously haha 

Before I got it, I was also looking into getting a tandem bike. They have places where you can rent them for an our or so! My dad took me to this park in the city, and he rode in the front, steering us, and the only thing I had to worry about was pedalling. It was pretty fun, but those bikes are EXPENSIVE...

I dont know if those options are suitable for you, though. There ARE blind sports, and maybe there are groups in your area! My favourite is goalball. Not sure how exercise-y it is, but I thought I'd put it out there haha.

It can be so hard to find a way to exercise that's accessible as a blind/visually impaired person and fun... good luck, I hope you find something you enjoy!
Outside - I enjoy walking when someone is able to accompany me and lend an arm. 

Inside - I enjoy Yoga and Pilates using videos from YouTube that are descriptive (some instructors are better verbally than others). I also LOVE trampolining, I purchased a Bellicon for in my home (I think that is how you spell it) it has a bar on the front, also you can pay a subscription for videos that I do intermittently. It is amazing how many exercises/stretches you can do just using a trampoline also, it is very versatile. Occasionally I enjoy a skipping rope in the sunshine too. 

I hope this helps or at least puts some ideas out there…."
I don't understand the concept of dancing.,30,Blind,"I have been a ballet dancer for quite a few years now. When I began dancing, there was an initial period where I did find the concepts of dance movements to be a bit abstract and hard to comprehend as an observer because of my visual impairment. However, the more I danced, the more I was able to appreciate the physical aspects of dance and all of its subtle nuances because I had an easier time relating to it from personal experience that I had gained as a dancer. Dance is a form of communication for me. It's about expressing who I am and how I am feeling emotionally, mentally, and physically. It also improves my physical and mental state of being. I love how it feels! When I started dancing, much of my training was very hands-on, and my teachers did have to show me how to place my body into positions. Verbal descriptions helped me as well, especially because ballet is so structured and has set terminology for each and every step and direction of the head, shoulders and body. Ballet even has terminology for the quality of movements (in other words, how a movement is supposed to be performed in order to convey a certain quality or artistic element). Because ballet is so structured and is based upon foundations that you work up to more advanced movements and steps from, it's easier to comprehend how a step should be performed when you have a basic idea of how your body should move in space based on the style of dance you are doing. As I progressed through my training to more advanced levels, I could listen to my teacher give an exercise combination and be able to perform it without having to be shown because I knew how to move my body and I knew which direction to move. There are unfortunately times when I still struggle as  a visually  impaired dancer, however. Creating a mental map of the environment and  navigating it in a patterned, planned fashion without getting disoriented can be a challenge at times. I don't care though. I still dance. To conclude, dance is often a rather visual art form, so I can certainly see how a non-dancer, or even someone who is just new to dance might have a harder time relating to it. Although dance can be quite visual in nature, if you choose a style of dance based upon who you are as a person and really immerse yourself in its history, movements, steps, evolution, music, and its different styles, you can learn to appreciate it in your own way. For example, I love the sound of pointe shoes as ballet dancers move across the stage or studio floor, I love the smell of the pointe shoes, I love the music, the atmosphere, the perfectly timed, precise movements, the history, and I love being a part of it all. Dance is a very poignant, sensory experience for me, and it's a big part of who I am as a person. I love dance! Sorry for my dancer rant! I'll stop now. I hope this is helpful.
I’m really impressed by the thoughtful series of answers you received to your question, OP.

I do a variety of social/partner dance styles and have dabbled in some solo dances like ballet. For the partner dancing, I love the physical movements in time to the music, but also finding new ways to respond to the music and the movements of my partner. There’s a give-and-take to the inertia and the movements that gives a visceral satisfaction. I also improved my physical fitness significantly when I started dancing regularly. 

One of the styles I love is called contra dancing. It’s a traditional dance form that requires sets of partners arranged in a line. They then perform a dance choreographed by a caller. The dancers perform the dance sequence in each set before progressing on to the next set to repeat the same choreography. One of the reasons that I particularly enjoy this style is what I think of as the puzzle factor. Each dance could be described as a new set of sequences that get you from one end of the room to the other, but there’s a lot of creativity that can be involved in how you get there. There’s also a lot of social fun to be had along the way; community, togetherness, laughing at our mistakes, enjoying friendship.

For ballet, I fell in love with the minute efforts that go in to mastering a dance sequence. Like any art form, it requires a great deal of practice and concentration. I found a completely new understanding of how my body worked through learning to make it do new things.

Thank you for sharing your question.
So I am completely blind, the only types of dancing I enjoy are tap dancing or like clog dancing. My suggestion to you is what if you found described video versions of old musicals and watched those to get an idea of that dancing style since you used to watch musicals live with your mom? 

I know I will never fully understand dancing, I do like the metaphor of music for your eyes. My sister studied dance when she was young so had to sit through a few recitals with no idea what was going on. 

But then again there are several things which I will never understand. I rarely get enjoyment over sports, I will never see paintings, and I only know some about the art of dance. But I once went to a production of the Nutcracker Suite ballet just to listen to the music while my friends enjoyed the dance and music, and did not feel like I only got half the experience."
Am I being too sensitive?,35,Blind,"She will crush your soul at some point,  I’ve been there and I divorced her. 
There’s only so much judgement and gaslighting a person can take. 

The work thing I understand,  it’s exhausting.

At night I use a mobility cane and I’m at the point, maybe beyond the point where I want to roar with anger at people interrupting me, turning their cars around to see if I need help.  I’ve been followed in my neighbourhood by a woman yelling at me I was walking the wrong way, when I was walking to a friends house. She was yelling and yelling at me.  She obviously knew where I lived.   
I have had a cop damage my retinas and accuse me of lying about my vision and refusing to take a spotlight out of my eyes, and getting hostile I was covering my eyes. 
I had a security car pull up on the footpath in front of me and demanding to know why I was walking alone on a street.  I wasn’t even near their business.  

It sucks… people don’t know when to bite their tongues. "
My partner is going blind at 30,17,Blind,"Has she had any kind of skills training? She's going to need orientation and mobility, Braille, assistive technology, and other life skills training to be able to function independently.  

If you're in the US, you need to contact your state's department of vocational rehabilitation to see about getting her enrolled in training. There are some immersive training programs that blindfold all participants, and get people functioning without sight pretty quickly. 

Blind people can be parents - I know a blind woman who has raised 4 kids, including one with autism. She does everything that any mother does, except drive. I also know a couple of blind women who raised children as single parents. It's hard - parenting in general is hard, and parenting with a disability is even harder - but it certainly can be done, and done well. If she doesn't have independent living skills though, she's not ready to be a parent. She needs to be able to take care of herself first. 

We also can have educations and careers. I'm 2 semesters away from completing my masters in computer science, and I work as an accessibility test engineer. Blind teachers also exist, and not just in schools for the blind. (Although teachers are quitting right and left at present.) 

Her world definitely doesn't have to shrink down to YouTube videos, but she's going to have to do the work to learn new skills. 

You should be aware that a lot of people who are losing sight show resistance to learning those skills at first. They tend to go through the stages of grief - denial, anger, depression, etc. So if she fights you at first on mobility training, Braille, etc. - that doesn't say anything about her as a person. It's a very common response.
I’m sorry, but as someone who plays video games, saying many are blind accessible is not true.

If you’re saying many might be accessible if you’re visually impaired, I wouldn’t know, but completely blind, no.

There are some that are accessible, on the PS5 there’s the last of us series,  God of war, although that isn’t fully accessible, mortal kombat 1, And one or two more,  I’ve missed.  The Xbox 360 I think it is? The latest one? Has Forza motorsports.  There are some games on steam that are accessible, but the unfortunate reality is tons of games aren’t accessible to us.

Personally, if you’re gonna go for a games console, I’d go for a PS5, it has the best screen reader in my opinion, although I haven’t tried an Xbox but there seems to be a couple more games on the PS5 anyway."
Failed attempts to overcome my vision/hearing disabilities and improve my life,11,Blind,"What about trying to look into hearing aids/cochlea implants? Someone else who is way more knowledgeable on This has already mentioned stuff here so that’s all I’ll  say on that.

As hard as it is, we’ve got to get off our arses and advocate for ourselves because no one else wi do it for us.

so look into hearing aids and see if you can get some grants or something and then maybe you could look into mobility/ o and m training to get outside more."
Life After High School Advice,5,Blind,"Get with his local state agency for the blind or his Lighthouse for the blind and they can help get him the services he needs to become a successful independent visually impaired adult.  Depending on his state, he might have a school for the blind that he can attend where they will teach him independent life, skills, and orientation and mobility skills plus things like reading, braille, and accessible technology for the visually impaired.  If you get a referral from your state agency for the blind, or the Lighthouse for the blind, most of the schools for blind individuals are free.

How good is he at using a computer, a tablet and a phone on his own knowing that he’s fully blind?  For all those devices, the screen, reader, software is free and built-in to the phone in the tablet and for the computer it’s also free and offers a lot of support for visually impaired and blind people.  Getting used to the screen reader on his phone is key because that’ll help him understand and be able to navigate screen readers, and what he would want to do for the future is get very comfortable with using the screen reader on a computer.  I know I mentioned the tablet and I don’t think the tablets too important, but just keep in mind that’s gonna be pretty much the same experience as using the screen reader on his phone so that’s not necessarily important as long as he has a decent phone, that’s he can use.  Just being honest here, but the Google pixel phones on the android side of things, and pretty much all the iPhones on the Apple side of things are super accessible when it comes to accessibility and their screen readers.

The NFB or the national Federation for the blind, will give them a free cane once a year, so you might want to get him signed up for one of those. That way he can learn to use it and become way more independent and be able just to walk outside safely and efficiently, if you so desires,.  Normally your state agency for the blind or the Lighthouse for the blind can assigned a orientation and mobility specialist to teach you how to use a cane, but I do know and rule situations it’s kind of hard to get one of those people out there.  If he manages to attend the school for the blind, which we pretty much all would recommend he does, they would teach him orientation and mobility skills there.

So yes, from afar, those are the two major things you can do for him is just make sure he has a decent, smart phone and he knows how to use it and it’s very proficient at using it and also he has access to a cane that he can use to travel And learn to become more independent one just being able to walk around on his own.  There are a few videos on YouTube, which you can listen to on teaching somebody how to use a white cane to help navigate but again the best thing to do is get them somebody in person to teach him.

I think that’s a good starting point and please let us know if you have any further questions.  Finding work as a visually impaired or blind person is very very very very difficult but it’s doable with a bit of effort.  He should just make sure he’s fully comfortable with using a computer blind
My 11 yo is well aware she will have to leave our rural location once she's finished school. Even if she moved to our nearest town it would be a help. She's always known she will need to live somewhere with public transport"
"Need advice. Struggling with studies, finding work, and life in general. (Also vent/rant)",6,Blind,"I can't help you much with most of your questions, except to wish you well and all the best, and it's a tough slog ahead.

a few things/ tips, might be totally wrong, so take them with a grain of sault.

Don't rely on your vision, use it as an extra pare of hands as it were when necessary, and instead of using read aloud, start using screen readers for both the PC and mobile. The sooner you do this, the better off you will be in the long run, could also give magnifiers a go, should they be of any help with the amount of vision you have.

Unfortunately, whilst screen readers do work with pdfs, and do not necessarily need to be converted to word, the flowcharts and tabular information is often screwed up. Don't rely on what your uni is teaching you, just see the topics they have, and learn them online through edx, khan acadimy and so on.

 The content will still likely be visual, but there are alternates to learning those or try and gain understanding through context/ other books materials.

&#x200B;

Studying offline is always a better idea, there's a slight chance you'll end up making friends there which will help a lot, but again a greater chance of you just ending up alone and ignored.

Expecting accessibility accommodation's from any uni in India is like expecting politicians to be saints, so you have to have work arounds for most things and most expenses are out of pocket for any and all assistive tech/ help that you might need/ require.

They do allow you writers for exams though, people who read the questions to you and will write what you say( don't get me started on how horrifyingly bad and or wrong this can and does go at times), although now they might also allow you to take your exams on a pc with a screen reader and or magnifier.

&#x200B;

When it comes to mobility and going anywhere alone in India,

Forget walking on the roads, it mostly consists of walking about and asking for help from people to get to where you want to go. to be fair the People in Mumbai are lovely, but asking for help of any kind has always been very difficult for me, at least.

Uber and such help a bit with mobility though, as long as you can afford it.

&#x200B;

Organizations in India to help the visually impaired or those going through vision loss do exist, but they are most often than not toxic, very rude and very likely of not much help unless you can politic with the best of them, in which case there might be some hope.

There's NAB (Has different state branches), TTI( in Pune), AICB and so on.

[eyeway.org](https://eyeway.org) is a decent resource for a list of organizations and a number where you can call and take help? from a counselor for the type of questions you have.

Hope this helps.
Hi, hope you are doing well, I have lived in India my entire life, recently moved to Australia, but I can tell you that I shared same sentiments as you while I was there.

  
For context I have ROP and Amblyopia and extreme myopia I don't know if it's as bad as your situation but I pretty much can't see from one eye and have very bad vision in my working eye.  
Now with the issues.  
Colleges in India are absolutely crap when it comes to accessibility and I realised it now after coming to Australia, one semester I spent at college in India 10 years ago was nightmare and I pretty much had to drop out cause I couldn’t understand anything in class I often got bored and left the class cause I couldn’t see the board or projector and teachers never uploaded lecture files on the learning platform, same problem with books as well I didn’t know much about screen readers back then so never used them.  
Just like you I always felt very lonely in India most of my adult life cause most of my existing friends moved out and making friends was really difficult, I couldn’t find any local groups or anything either, I did make an discord server before but that server is now dead but you can join discord server of this sub reddit of which I am a part of as well and it’s a chill place.   
For physical activity since my doctor told me not to lift heavy weights I resorted to walking that too mostly inside my house cause I can’t see much in night time.  
Now about going out and stuff I used UBER and OLA a lot but I know it’s not the most affordable options.  
in recent years right before I moved here I used swiggy for pretty much everything from ordering groceries to send stuff to people’s houses again depends on availability, I used Urban company for getting haircuts etc.  
If you don’t already have UDID get one it’s important.  
now the job part,  
I am fortunate enough to have a family business, but after dropping out of college I learned web development and started freelancing I didn’t make substantial income but it was better than not making anything, since I want to have good financial future I started inventing at very young age as well.  
I am not sure how much this reply helped you but hope you feel better feel free to message me cheers."
Active/outdoor career options,2,Blind,"It takes some work to get the licenses but Orientation and Mobility specialist if you don't mind working with people in a sometimes stressful situation.
Might be able to do sports coaching if you like sport."
white cane vs sighted parent - advice appreciated,13,Blind,"I know your pain, my dad is the same way. No matter how many surgeries I have had, no matter how many specialists I have seen, he still accuses me of faking it. He could never get over the ""shame"" of me not being a sportsball champ when I was 6. 

But the funny thing is it is all him projecting. He is the king of making medical excuses. He has claimed to have many maladies and conditions so he can get out of doing things he detests. He claimed he had ""da shits"" once so he could avoid taking Mom to a doctor's appointment. He claimed he caught it off a child. The child was lactose intolerant. Yes, he claimed he caught being lactose intolerant. It was just a lie. He is so used to lying he assumes everyone else does it as well. So I would be screamed at all the time. He would assume I was just putting on an act.
Use it, if he starts yelling, oh well. Tell him to get over it because you need to use this aid and it is not his life.

The more you use it, the better you’ll be for the future. You know what, get mobility training, and tell them what he’s saying in front of him, and see what happens then because they won’t take shit from him."
Seeking Guidance for Solo Gym Workouts - Assistance Needed,4,Blind,"At this point, I think I’m just going to have to settle of paying a premium for a private trainer. They’ll help me adjust my workout plans and make sure I’m targeting the right areas since I do require a specific plann. Also, it ensures that I’m safe as I’m walking with someone one on one the entire time. It’s a bit expensive, but I was expecting it to be way more!"
Your help regarding an Uber driver,19,Blind,"YouTuber Molly Burke, who is blind, has [complained about the same thing in a video](https://youtu.be/J0hJlzkQr8Q) — drivers driving away as soon as they spot her guide dog. Obviously they should be following the ADA, as it is discrimination, period. Her response in the moment was to either sit in the car before they could leave and refuse to move, or have her mom get in the car while she literally hides and then she and her dog would get in the car after her mom was inside the car. Guide dogs are a mobility aide and should be treated as such."
VI & Adapted Physical Education,5,Blind,"Depends what sport really. Perkins learning has some good resources. I mainly play football (soccer) and goalball so if you'd like anything more specific let me know :)
Hi there! Totally blind tennis player here with a long history of international sport. Happy to chat :)"
Partially blind with unknown cause. Just looking to vent.,30,Blind,"Ooh OP as a mom my heart feels so much for you, I wish I could give you a big long hug. 

This is going to be long and please forgive me if you have been there done that but maybe if I share it will help if not just disregard it 😊

Have you had genetic testing? I assume you have because you are soo frustrated with testing but at the same time in my experience I thought all the tests had been done but at the same time there is more value to having the right people interpret those tests. I’ll share my experience with my son and if you’ve done all this I still think you are valid and I don’t want to give unsolicited advice or disregard your frustration.

But It might help if you have not?

My son has a disease that is so rare they call it an orphan disease. Even though it is genetic it is recessive and there is no family history on his father or my side of the family because it is recessive. It also wasn’t even properly correlated to a gene until one year before my son was tested at 2 so 8 years! Meaning if you had genetic testing more than 8 years ago there may be newly discovered things to test for.

My sons disease causes the retina to “not work” but the retinal imaging shows as you said “immaculate” retinas. 

There is no evidence of any damage or dysfunction in his eyes and the disease actual is more dangerous to his kidneys though they are stable now and also not damaged.

I’m not sayin you have the same thing as him but some of the “best” eye specialists were the most pompous dismissive assholes when he was a baby and I was trying to find out what was goin on.

In fact I knew he was blind when I gave birth to him I just knew even though his eyes “looked” typical.

I stupidly assumed doctors would be interested and yet I was totally lied to and in fact made to feel crazy the first year of his life because there was no “evidence” even his dad didn’t believe me til he wasn’t making eye contact at 6 months and still maintained that “maybe it’s cataracts but he looked at me when he was born” 
My ex was caught up in himself and ego. So no he didn’t look at him or me (the mom who he would have look at the most when born) he even had trouble breastfeeding because of it…because he can’t fuckin see!

I was blamed for this as well ! doctors can be so divorced from their patients experiences.

 He has light perception that is it nothing else he has never seen my face.

However when we did get the genetic results he ended up being recorded into the NIH as being the “first recorded” to have this who is ALSO blind from birth.

Usually it seems in the cases they have studied about this disease, kids are born with normal vision and there is no indication of an issue. It’s degenerative in nature so everyone they have on record before my kid usually starts to have issues with one eye onset anywhere from 5-18 years of age on average and it usually presents in one eye first and the other much much later. So obviously they don’t know shit about it if my son presents totally different.

So real long way of sayin as someone whose gone through the doctors gaslighting me about what “I know” because they can’t or won’t accept how little “they know” about is excruciating. 

I can’t imagine dealin with it from the perspective of being the one with vision issue. 

I am so so sorry. You are not in the wrong to be at your wits end. I hope you know your experience is valid no matter what some jerk who is also a doctor says to you.

I did not mean to scare you by suggesting genetic testing but I also know how different these things can present and my son only got a doctor who is his advocate and listens to me once I had genetic tests done because as you said “must be faking there is no damage”.

So ruling that part out might show a path to understanding and proper care. Once he started seeing doctors at CHOP in Philly I legitimately wanted to go beat the shit out of everyone in my state my son has been seen by who called themselves a fucking doctor. 

The difference in treatment was staggering. 

Perhaps reach out to them? Even though they are a children’s hospital they see adults because of how much research they do on visual impairments. It felt a lot more comfortable to deal with doctors being so open to how much they don’t know about the eye. So the team there would not be the type to say “you are faking” and just dismiss you.

He also had his vision tested in an intensive way you might benefit from. 

Over the course of a week (and now once a year since) he had MRI, cat scans, ultrasounds, macular photographs, retinal imaging, orientation  and mobility aptitude tests where a sort of “safe” obstacle course is traversed by the patient at different times in their day and different light settings,a bunch of other stuff too. 

The results are then all combined and looked at over the course of a month or two after you leave then they speak to you about findings and recommendations. Then you continue to have this stuff monitored. 

There was a woman there who actually had never known it was not typical to have clouded depth perception and had assumed everyone had the same experience until she brought her child in for issues w his eyes. 

It broke my heart to hear how dismissed she had been most of her life when she ever did bring it up with a doctor.

I hope you get the answers and validation and care that you deserve. You sound like you need some piece of mind and care and I hope I can give a little of that to you right now 🤗

It seems like you have really tried to build a good life for yourself regardless of the difficulties but it seems less about lack of vision and more about the stress from the unknown and lack of care from the people who are supposed to care about these things.

I wish you the best and I hope you are more gentle with yourself. It’s really not your fault and yet seems like you’ve been shamed enough by doctors to almost feel as though it is.

That is not ok and you don’t deserve that type of “non” treatment. Wishing you the best of outcomes as you seek answers, and don’t let some jerks who happen to have a medical degree stop you from demanding proper care and an answer to what is happening with your vision.

❤️🤗

I've had them before, but it's been a while. I was supposed to see an optaneurologist in a city an hour away, but never made it in because of transportation issues. I'm getting another referral to the doctor next month, and I'll hike there if I have to."
"tips for when you don't ""look blind"" in public?",19,Blind,Yeah of course the best way is having a white cane. They have short ones that are not for actual orientation and mobility called identity canes that are smaller and will help let people know that you can't see. I'm in the same boat as you and I don't look blind either. Sometimes I close my eyes And keep them closed which always makes people wonder why would he do that and then they noticed my white cane and they don't ask anymore questions about the obvious situation. I've tried wearing dark sunglasses but I live in a hot place so my face is always getting sweaty and who likes that? I use a long white cane which is pretty big and hard to miss especially in crowds as the handle sticks up above my shoulder and people behind me can see that I have the white cane so they don't try to push past me when I'm in line or walking in a group. There are options to get free white canes but I guess it depends where you live. Good luck
"For those of you who don’t know, you can use an apple Magic Keyboard on your iOS device",10,Blind,"What i meant by the layout is the form factor of the board. Having the function layer but missing out on all the less useful parts of the full sized keyboards like a numpad and other such things. I use the laptop layout on nvda even with a full board because I just prefer most hotkeys to be within arms reach. So I am basically saying that I prefer the 75% layout of the apple keyboard over other layouts like 60%, full sized, TKL, 65%, etc. It is also very lightweight and easy to transport. Sure, I probably could have found something cheaper that does the same task fairly well, but this board was right there and so I just didn’t see much of a need to do something like that is all."
Hoping for Guidance Around Losing Sight,10,Blind,"As I'm sure you've realized, lots of blind people do have some functional sight! So perhaps you've been in proximity with a blind/VI person and never knew it ☺️

Additionally, regardless of if you pursue surgery, I'd look to see if there are any low vision services even remotely in your area. Orientation & Mobility, Vision Rehab, any sort of adaptive tech services. That will introduce you to lots of strategies and resources. Those professionals - I'm one of them, and I'm blind! - will probably have suggestions for in person networking, even if it's a bit of a drive, or only once a month, or over Zoom, etc."
Question about cane use for night blindness and lack of depth perception,26,Blind,"Do what you need to do to feel safe when walking.  That's it.  There's really no other consideration needed.  Doctor recommended it?  That's always a pretty good indicator of what mobility equipment you need. 

Get training to use it properly and to get the correct length and tip."
