Business Idea Assignment Help,2,disability,"Some /questions:

1. How would you try to make it affordable? Disabled people are disproportionately low-income.

2. Would promotional materials acknowledge that certain types of exercise can be harmful for certain disabled people? Like the harms it could do for ME/CFS.

3. What Covid-19 precautions would be in place for one-on-ones? Could there just be an online version for those of us doing work outs alone in our room?

4. What steps would you to make sure that online components are fully accessible?

5. Would information about this program also be available in plain language?
I’m glad you’re thinking of the disability community. There’s not enough out there. There are a few, AMG fitness comes to mind
https://www.amgfitness.org
Keep in mind, a business like this will also appeal to elderly folks wanting to stay active."
I think most of us can agree we would be happier if we didn’t have  a chronic illnesses/disability (vent),51,disability,"It’s kinda like, well be grateful you don’t have to stress about bills or rent. That doesn’t make me feel any less depressed. In fact, I envy that’s what able bodied people have to worry about. Not that their health is declining or they are losing mobility year after year. 

I think I just need to sort out my thoughts and feelings on my own and not come to her. I hope eventually I can get to a point where my disability doesn’t bother me as much but it will take a long time.
My doctor had told the same thing. MD doesn’t cause pain. In a sense, it is true. It doesn’t cause pain directly but it does causes other muscles to compensate for the weak ones and that what causes the pain. Yet if we didn’t have MD we would not be in pain at all. So the way I see it is MD does cause pain no matter how you look at it. 

He won’t prescribe me anything either. He said to try and use mobility aids and see if that helps. I wish doctors could experience what it is like to have MD and see if they could do their job without pain killers. Would they even be able to keep up with their job with MD?Probably not!"
"I’m becoming bitter at a friend calling themselves disabled, and I don’t like it",155,disability,"I had to fall and hit my head twice before I started using the mobility aids my doctor wanted me to use. I don’t go out in public due to being embarrassed and afraid I’ll fall in public. I’m sorry you feel the way you do, and I’m terrified for you falling in public and hurting yourself any more than you already have. I really admire how you have become comfortable with the label and being disabled, I still really struggle with it but I’m working on it. I read you use your wheelchair, walker, and braces, maybe you could have someone help you get around when you have to go out? I dint mean to sound insensitive, i just know falling on top of everything else can not be good and sounds so scary.

There does seem to be some weird thing going on now people want to be or claim to be disabled. My friend said it must be nice to get pity and sympathy and have people try to accommodate me best they can. I was completely taken aback by that remark, and have put a lot of distance between us. Maybe have a serious conversation with your friend how insensitive and tone deaf they trying to one up your disability makes you feel. If they disregard your feelings, maybe it’s time to take a break from the friendship.
It's hard, because they probably don't realise what they're doing, and maybe they're responding to you in the way they would like to be responded to (if you catch my drift). I think some other people further up the thread had some good ways to break it to them that they're making you feel bad.

I think some people feel the same way as you do if I talk about being disabled (fibro/CFS, T1D, hypermobility syndrome, clinical depression/anxiety, migraines, autism, gastroparesis and IBS in my case) because they've got something more obviously disabling, like cerebral palsy, cancer of some kind, serious hearing loss, limb paralysis etc and I do get it, but I still need to describe my own problems to other people in a way they'll understand without drifting off. I guess we all just need to be mindful of others' issues somehow.
TL;DR Don't think you are a gatekeeper but rather suffer from your friends (unintended, I think) ""trivialisation"" of what you are going through. Good luck on maintaining that friendship and making the situation more comfortable for both of you.
___
I only have one mental disability (if depression doesn't count) and thought at first what you mentioned later: Oh, another gatekeeper. But the further I read, the less it seemed to me that you were gatekeeping at all. I don't like to compare illnesses in a contest like way, since depression seems like nothing compered to the struggles life have in store for others, yet still the mortality rates for depressions alone are scaring.

Yet what you describe, in my opinion, isn't about disability, but about making your struggles unseen by trivialising them. It is like … I am from Germany and we have here the nasty history about Nazi-Germany, the second world war and the Shoa, the mass-killings of jewish (and other) people. And therefore a law, that prohibits the trivialisation of national socialism, because it makes the victims and their sufferings unseen, if somebody, for example, compares unpleasant and unjust experiences with the mass-killings and torture in the so called ""Third Reich"".

I think that, on a different scale, you are fighting a similar conflict as you are not really gatekeeping (you never told your friend off or corrected them, when they mentioned an illness to others without saying, that they ""only"" self diagnosed themself, etc.), but that you struggle with your friends (unconscious, I think) attempt to trivialise the magnitude of your struggles, by comparing them with … far lesser (appearing?) common sufferings.

Like … someone here posted, a few days ago a screenshot of a post in an amputee subreddit of a women who has broken a finger and asked, in earnest, the amputees for advice how to deal with this, for her new, reality. It wasn't, in my opinion, gatekeeping either, when one user there told her to f*** herself with that broken finger she still had. Comparing ones own life with a **broken finge**  to that with the lives of people, who had lost their limbs … makes the struggles of the tatter unseen, as one might think ""*well, I've broken my finger once, and it did hurt, yes … but if that's all, an amputee have to suffer from, they really should get a grip and go on instead of …*"".

Really, I understand (no, not your MS, but) your annoyance with your friends (I think unintended) trivialisation of your sufferings. I think (but please be carful when following my advices, for I have for reasons no friends at all), that you …

- should explain to your friend, what harm their comparing do to you, so that they maybe keep it to themselves. That alone isn't gatekeeping, I'd say.
- accept if the continue labelling themself and for themself - even if they don't do the physio-exercises nor seek official diagnosis, etc. Because invisible disabilities ""can"" be more harmful, than they appear and one can never be really sure of the magnitude of another persons suffering - or so I think. If self-labelling helps them - why not? (As long as they don't harm others that way, by trivialising their struggles or taking away much needed resources, etc.)

Honestly, I don't see you as a gatekeeper at all. And think that your annoyances are quite understandable and reasonable. I hope you'll find a way to hold that friendship **and** find a way to stop letting your friends behaviour harm you as well.
My therapist (who was already solid, after a long time of me searching for one) became disabled after a few months of first seeing her. She had to take some months off and I don’t know the details of her condition (unnecessary), but she has disclosed that she has gained some of the same health struggles I have, some of which are more severe. It’s been pretty healing (seemingly for both of us) to be able to talk about the realities of this and the process of acclimating to these things. She was already very compassionate but the not needing to explain all of it is actually really nice, that a lot is just understood. Obviously I wish her health crisis hadn’t happened at all, I’ve had some years to adjust to my situation and can manage emotionally with most of it now (thanks in part to my husband also losing his health near the same time I did, though before we were together). I hate that she’s going through this shit too. But I can also definitely vouch for the ways having a disabled therapist can be healing. 

A very minor point, but when OP mentions the friend dances and still maintains a social life, well I can get the bitterness (I was functionally bedbound and extremely isolated for several years), but outside of trying to keep up that lifestyle potentially damaging the friend’s recovery/maintenance plans I will say that this might be a tiny bit reductive. My health issues are more severe it seems than their friend’s - I have constant and severe back pain that often means days in bed at a time, plus neurological issues from the same cause and having to catheterize as well as the regular infections that can come with that, which I’ve always been prone too. But even though my bad days outnumber the good ones and minor household chores can be enough to wreck me for days (I’m not nearly consistent enough to work), I have made some small improvements over the last couple years from my previous state of basically being wholly unable to take care of myself. And when I’m able, I try once a week to have one night to regularly socialize and often enough dance. Losing my physical functionality and my muscles atrophying into uselessness was pretty traumatic in itself, but the isolation was probably more life threatening. I was in extremely deep depression and even with my husband there for me felt very isolated, like I was no longer part of the world around me. 

Since I finally found decent doctors who will treat me (I was “too young for chronic pain,” regardless of the ten inch scar down my spine and obvious history of spina bifida) making sure I have some social outlets and sources of small joys had been a priority. I was losing my sense of self so badly, just being able to be around other people once a week has had such a huge impact and given me more strength and support to draw on during the bad days (which happen regularly whether or not I go out occasionally). I used to hate dancing due to self consciousness and how even before my crisis my body hurt and was misreading nerve signals. But honestly, I kind of love it now. I take it easy, mostly dance at goth nights (as you can kind of dance however you want to for that lol), and I do need to rest more the next day. But idk. It sparks joy to be able to use my body at all now. To be able to do anything remotely fun in it. I’m willing to take on some extra aches on top of my baseline pain for that, and honestly it’s helped motivate me to gently exercise with an easy outlet that can be as rigorous or gentle as I need it to be. It’s a luxury that not everyone gets, but I’m extremely glad I get to do it. Before I was able to rebuild any social life I mostly existed in this horrible state of suffer through, wait, try to believe that things can someday be better. That and my husband kept me from suicide at many points right after I’d lost everything with my health (my dream job, my sense of self, even most of my family since they treated me as “choosing to be weak”). But it’s not sustainable and finding small joys to live for, even if they expend some of my precious energy, has been incredibly helpful. 

I hope the friend learns to moderate between what they are used to and what they need to take care of themselves. But I honestly hope they can keep that zeal for life, keep having social outlets, keep dancing. It’s understandable for OP to feel bitter about it, the way the friend is trying to “relate” by constantly recenter themselves is irritating as hell, and there should probably be either a conversation or some distance. I felt pretty damn bitter when I was watching the world pass me by in the immediate aftermath of my health crisis, back when I still didn’t have coping tools and everything was so new and overwhelming. It’s fair to not want to be reminded of the things OP can’t do especially while this is fresh. But I also think we should try not to be crabs in a bucket to each other or police how people manage their health too much. Even with relatively minor health issues (at least compared to what many of us deal with) it’s understandable for people to cope differently and want to hold onto things that bring joy when possible. 

I also don’t like the idea of particularly able bodied people being like “well you can dance, you must not *acshually* be disabled” when for a lot of us the degree of our limitations is highly variable on the day and it’s the overall inconsistency of health that makes things the most challenging. Like for me most people will not see me on the bad days because I literally can’t leave the house. Of course I’m going to look more well to them than is representative of my reality. And the few times I’ve needed to be around people (other than my husband) on the bad days (which again, more days are bad than good even now) the shock at what that looks like is visible - on some level they just assumed I was exaggerating 🤷🏻 I’m not going to give up the few little things I have that keep me going to appear “disabled enough” for people who will always look for a reason to ignore the needs of disabled people.
EDS is Eherlos Daniel Syndrome - it's hyper mobility in your joints
It's like the example of someone in a wheelchair.   They are mostly perceiving that they get to sit down wherever they go.   Not how much difficult that really makes life.   That these disabilities prevent us from being truly independent in our lives.   

These kinds of people take for granted their own abilities.  They can't see how much quality of life  Diminishes, more dependent someone is.   

It's concepts that they can't wrap their head around because they've experienced nothing that prevents them from being independent.   

For example,  The simple act of just getting dressed in the morning.   They can get themselves dressed and they can decide to go somewhere's for the day.   They don't have to take into account how their currently feeling,  The time and effort it takes to get dressed.  Even the thinking process that goes along with how to accomplish these tasks.  The energy levels after completing these tasks which takes so much more energy than the average person.  

You have to think about how you're going to be safe if you want to even go to groceries.   Maybe transportation issues because you can't walk,  Or always being in a state of Anxiety because you don't have full control over the actions of your own body.  

I personally always have anxiety because I'm more vulnerable than the average person.  If I get triggered I risk my body collapsing and  completely vulnerable to any stranger coming up to me.   

To an everyday average person living that regular lives,  Could be life-threatening to me or other people with disabilities.   I don't think they understand because they've never had to live With everyday choices being a risk to their life.   

And people Struggling with real disabilities,  Don't want their disabilities.   I'm speaking in general I'm sure  There are always exceptions.  

I firmly believe most people would rather try to live and average everyday life where they're independent and they can choose to live their life the way they want and do what they want.  They have to revolve their lives around their disability.   Not  Because they choose to ,  But because there is no other way around it.  

I find a general good way to tell a difference between someone who is really struggling and trying to live life with disability, And someone who's following the trend,  Is there behavior and how the act towards it.   Most people and I'm saying most because like I said before there are exceptions,   Don't like to bring attention to their disabilities.  Unless it's for education sake.   

They don't want to be seen for their disability.  They want to be seen for who they are as a person.   And these people make what they consider a disability their whole personality in life.   They go out of their way to bring attention to themselves.  But they show no signs of trying to do anything to help themselves.  

There's a kind of arrogance in their demeanour.   And whether they are truly disabled or not it just shows that a personality is c***** and that their self-centered.
It’s sad that all of us had the same experience with medical.  I just happen to be very stubborn, so after hearing that I just had to “maybe try a cane” because I was only 40, I bought a used mobility scooter.  It changed my life so radically that I knew it couldn’t be wrong to use!  
Our doctors tell us that we should have a bunch of options to deal with our issues, a “toolbox” of things, from medication, various talk or physical therapies, exercise, diet, etc, an appropriate mobility aid is not to be feared!  My roommate and I (we both use wheelchairs, I’m able to walk in the house, she can do a couple of steps) are prime examples.  When we each got our wheelchairs, we both LOST weight, because we were able to cook and shop far more easily!  Yet we chose to purchase our own mobility devices (and yes, we are both lucky we have that ability), because we only qualify for a walker to shuffle a few feet…. Our chairs keep us lively and independent, but for some reason, that’s not a good thing, lol?"
i love this. furries are cool actually ,581,disability,"Any conventions in Canada or USA? I have a passport 🥺 love furries
I would legit attach some of these to my mobility aid or backpack. I love this so much! "
Handicapped parking,20,disability,"A placard let’s you park in a handicapped spot, period. If your doctor signed off, you are deemed disabled. Don’t overthink this. It’s commendable to think of others but using your logic, you should never use your placard because someone with more severe mobility issues would always “need” it more. Just park where you need to, to keep you & your child safe.
As someone with a placard for my mostly invisible disability, (which I always need mobility aids for, sometimes a wheelchair,) ignore the haters and do what you feel is best. If you need the space, use the space. No need to feel guilty about it, or rationalize to yourself how to use it. Do what you need to do to keep your kid safe! Where I am, there are also spaces for moms with kids. If you have similar, you could always use those if you can't make yourself use the disabled spaces. They're also right up front. 

I do know what it's like. The first time I was approached and judged for using a disabled space, I went home and cried the rest of the night. I've grown a very thick skin since. They don't know you or what you're going through. It sounds like you'd qualify just for your ankle issue alone, let alone dealing with your son. So go ahead and use the space. As long as the person has a placard, that's all I care about. It's all the people parking there without one that I take issue with."
making disabled friends?,5,disability,"I have no idea about your physical condition, but have you considered trying sports?
 
It's the best thing I did for myself.  Improved my body and met many people (disabled and not). 

So you could do some research if you are interested in sports and I'm sure you'll find something!
Sounds perfect to me! Also, because you said about heart issues, there is a sport for only ""heavy"" disabilities that is called boccia.  So this is something totally safe for you. You could check that as well! Wish you the best of luck!"
Mental and Physical - annoyed (a work rant),3,disability,"Ugh you get it. It doesn't get easier but it's just...annoying? I am not powerchair yet but not far off, how did it help your mobility? Is it easier to get to shops and the like or harder because of the need to transport the chair? Hope it's not rude to ask! Just hoping to find good recs for when that day comes. Because it WILL. 

  
Also thanks for just being honest and saying it won't get better. It won't. I know that. You know that. Platitudes don't make it better, but someone being real with you...that makes it better. :)
Powerchair basically made the difference between being trapped in the flat, completely dependent on others (usually strangers) and a reasonable amount of self sufficiency.

Where I live, within 15 minutes walking distance, there’s about 5 drugstores, 2 huge groceries and another small one, 5 discounters, multiple Cafés and bakeries not counting those in the grocery stores, 3 butchers, a very high quality perfume and makeup and such store, multiple pharmacies, 4 hairdressers and 3 parks. And iirc 3 or 4 are not accessible to me. Every other store I can go in, look around, get assistance as needed for articles on high or low shelves, check out, pay, pack my purchases all by myself if I want to.

Yes, it complicates transit somewhat. I use public transit as much as possible, and a disabled transport taxi service. When DH and I want to go somewhere in a car, we’re stuck with an uncomfortable old folding manual chair, but we’ve managed to make do.

If at all possible, look into the ottobock selection of powerchairs. You can choose standard rear wheel drive, or get front wheel drive (or even middle!) and they look good while being built like tanks. Almost indestructible.

Direct honesty is the least you deserve. I just hope you’re spared the path my progression chose to take. I turn 40 soon, but my heart is so damaged that I repeatedly get warnings from medical professionals that I’m on borrowed time. Ugh! Stupid fucking bodies! *hugs*

DM me anytime you need to vent or anything."
Update on my life,1,disability,"Have you ever been tested for hypermobility?
I have a feeling it's EDS but I haven't been through the hyper mobility test. My mom has EDS too so it wouldn't be shocking."
Gifted kid turned physically disabled teen,15,disability,"I can't speak to ""gifted"" as that category isn't used in my country, but I would highly recommend adaptive sport for improvement of mental health following physical disability. I wasn't a child when I became physically disabled, but I was midway through my MSc, and sport is essentially what kept me together when I was having to navigate a new reality post-impairment during a stressful time. 

May be worth researching and seeing if there are any para/adaptive sport groups that she could join."
Question for disabled folks,4,disability,"I would go rollerblading immediately. Followed by cave diving, followed by running, followed by cliff diving. (I used to be an extreme sports athlete before my disability got bad.)
I would be freaked out for a full day and then I would sign up for a marathon. Or bungee jumping or go get a passport and go to every country I can.
That happened to me once. I have a brain injury plus a brain stem injury so I have various mobility and cognitive impairments.  
  
So like in your post, when I suddenly was ""able-bodied"" in every way, it absolutely freaked me out and I was scared but then started to get happy when my hands and arms worked and I could walk well without losing my balance and needing supports. As an aside, I have always considered myself lucky because with my regular testing and hospital visits, I see people far worse than me.

Anyway, my initial shock or worry was replaced with joy and I became more and more ecstatic until I fell over into a pool or river of smelly gel or poop and then woke up.  
  
Yup, it was all a dream for me. However, I think that is how I would likely feel in real life."
Any good movies/books with main characters who are physically disabled?,9,disability,"I just finished a space opera trilogy (the Final Architecture) by Adrian Tchaikovsky, where one of the main characters is doesn’t have the standard compliment of limbs and uses a few different mobility devices to compensate. She’s portrayed quite well IMO, not just for sympathy and not as a supercrip either. There are spots where she’s genuinely in trouble that an able person would not be."
"do able-bodied people with somewhat sedentary childhoods get like this? do their bodies start ""giving out"" on them around age 25?",25,disability,"Yeah I agree, it’s possibly your hypotonia kind of “catching up” to you or something else underlying. Healthy sedentary people might have some temporary pain from increased exercise or be more at risk of injury from not warming up/escalating exercise correctly but not to this extreme? I’m glad your doctor seems on top of referrals to specialists. 

FWIW I’ve always had mildly lower core muscle tone and I was in OT for something sort of related. We tried starting to work on it but I didn’t tolerate it well and my OT said it would be very long term/slow. It’s not so bad that I felt up to that at the time haha (it’s more that I can’t do stuff like rock climbing or treading water, doesn’t affect my posture like yours does), but I have been slowly trying some yoga that focuses on that. But yeah maybe getting into PT/OT could help even if it is slow going like mine said. 
A few things about your post really stand out to me. If you have POTS, it's extremely common to also have some form of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). That usually presents with hypermobility, joint and/or tendon pain, frequent joint dislocations or subluxations, things like that. Only a few types of EDS have been genetically sequenced so getting gene testing isn't necessarily guaranteed to produce an answer for you on that disorder.

And when it comes to you going to the gym and PT but never having it feel ""easier"", have you always experienced this at all ages when it comes to any type of exercise, where it feels like you should be building muscle but you haven't? Have you ever been evaluated by a neurologist? Do you have an abnormal walking gait/do you waddle when you walk? Do you have abnormally large calf muscles? Do you experience scapular winging (where your shoulder blades stick out from your back when you hold your arms straight out in front of you), have had problems in your childhood/teens with getting down to/up from a sitting position on the ground (and especially if you've never been able to get up/down like your peers via essentially doing a squat)? Have you ever gotten blood results back that came with very high liver enzymes or a high bilirubin? There are a few types of Muscular Dystrophy that can basically show no/very mild symptoms until around 20's-40's, especially ones like Limb-Girdle, Becker, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (all forms of Muscular Dystrophy). There are a LOT of subtypes for these specific types of MD, and even people with the same subtype can vary wildly in their symptom onset, disease progression, and severity of symptoms, but these diseases are very rare, so definitely don't freak out if any of this sounds familiar, just be sure to bring it up to your doctor as soon as you can.

I usually don't like to do the whole ""armchair diagnosis"" thing, but I have Limb-Girdle MD type 2i and your post sounds almost exactly like something I would have wrote like 15 years ago lol. Let me know if you have any questions and I hope you find the answers you're looking for ❤
i figure the hypotonia is catching up with me, the neurosurgeon and his PA i spoke to about potential chiari (i have slightly low cerebellar tonsils but apparently whether something counts as CM-1 depends on the diagnostician) & spine problems didn't seem to be a concerned much at all about hypotonia that doesn't seem to have gone away since childhood, PCP is willing to refer me to a neurologist once i get other more pressing stuff out of the way first which i agree with since i'm a full-time student & this stuff isn't as concerning as the gynecological disorder doing things like causing me very severe leg pain, worse than anything the low muscle tons has ever led to

and aaahhh!!!!! i love swimming, that was my fav sport they made me try but i couldn't keep up with my peers & had to drop out for other reasons as well, my school used to have a pool but they shut it down due to lack of finances for upkeep 😔
my OT had to google what hypotonia was (which is funny because it's not really a common thing?) & my last attempt at PT had me leaving in tears because i felt like i wasn't really being understood/taken seriously & that feeling activated the trauma from my child abuse/medical neglect, so yeah that didn't go well

i'm willing to try PT again at some point (hopefully before i lose my medicaid) but i really want a better picture of what's going on at first so i can stop telling people these vague things & ""maybe's"" and maybe also find a PT familiar with what my issues are instead of just any old PT, i might see about it over the summer depending on what happens between now & then since it wouldn't work well with my class schedule right now

i have hard time with coordinating different muscle groups at the same time to properly do some exercises though (potential chiari has been dismissed so maybe undx'd dyspraxia), they had to cue me on stuff up until i was discharged so there was minimal improvement in that area & that's something that gets in the way of doing stuff on my own which is kinda what's necessary for PT, very annoying

i wish my parents got me PT as a kid 😔
i have generalized symptomatic hypermobility but any joint instability has stopped being an issue since i started taking continuous birth control so while i think hEDS (if not gHSD, i was denied for genetic testing but the only genetic form i fit the symptom profile of is pretty rare - clEDS - so unlikely) is a possibility getting that exact dx isn't a priority for me atm, and no, to my knowledge i've never seen a neurologist, though i plan to

i was dedicated to the gym last summer, and i may have been seeing improvement in the context of the gym (i wasn't really keeping track but all i can say now is that after a long break i'm having a much harder time getting started again than i did the first time i started), but specifically what i meant about the ""getting better"" part is less gym performance and more not seeing improvement in being able to do my part-time job or ""ordinary"" life things requiring physical effort (including having good posture and being able to sit at my desk), so i can't really say for sure if i haven't been able to build muscle

as for other stuff:

- i think i waddle but only contextually, like depending on how i'm feeling, most days i don't think i do, according to my first PT session i have some mild gait abnormalities like bilateral trendelenberg, neurosurgeon i recently saw said i had a normal gait & no signs of muscle atrophy
- no clue about the scapular winging (edit: took a look, doesn't seem like it, not when i hold my arms out)
- afaik my calf muscles are normal, i don't know what would qualify as too big but they seem normal to me
- as for getting up, i've always had some level of difficulty/preference for using my hands or the support of something else to give up, i forgot the name for the specific ""sign"" that is getting up in a certain way that indicates some type of weakness, is that what you're referring to? squats in the gym are REALLY hard on me, i know that, & if i deep squat i risk my muscles not letting me go up immediately, i don't think that's what you mean though
- no idea about bilirubin & the only time i think i've had high liver enzymes is when i was in the hospital for an overdose on tylenol, so probably not relevant lmao

hopefully a neurologist will be amenable to looking into the muscle stuff & my nerves being shitty (lifelong paresthesias) but we'll see - i appreciate your input! also yeah, i recently learned CMT-2 was even a thing, let alone there being like 80 of them lmao
I also have congenital hypotonia for me my issues were caused by a connective tissue disorder (Hypermobility spectrum disorder).
i had a pretty bad bout of influenza once but that was so long ago i couldn't say whether or not that was the trigger, i also have generalized joint issues + generalized hypermobility but any pain/other problems related to that have virtually disappeared since taking continuous birth control so seeking evaluation for possible hypermobile EDS (i was denied genetic testing due to lacking certain clinical criteria so monogenic EDS is unlikely i guess) or generalized HSD isn't as high a priority on my list as all the stuff i have that sometimes occurs alongside it (on top of the fact there's no medical professionals around me who know enough about that stuff), for the POTS getting testing for potential SFSN/other nerve problems is something i'd seek out before anything to do with hEDS or gHSD"
What was the breaking point that made you get a cane/other mobility aid?,5,disability,"I'd get a Mobility Scooter if I could, but even second hand they're over £700 (WTF?!)"
AITAH for not wanting to meet in the park for the first date as a physically disabled woman?,112,disability,"Why did he want to go to a park? 

Personally I'm immunocompromised in addition to my mobility impairment so I will only do the first 3-5 dates outdoors for safety reasons. 

There's no reason for him to be rude or pushy regardless but I'm wondering if it was a case of opposing access needs.
Honestly, as someone whose not in a wheelchair 24/7 and occasionally uses a cane for mobility assistance..

Hell I wouldn't meet someone in a park when I was (more) able bodied for a first date unless I already knew them really really well. 

First date out of the blue which is also first time meeting someone in person? I ain't meeting that person in a park. I ain't going on a hike as a first date. 

And hell, if they're doing that much pushback on something as simple and unthreatening as where our first (0date) date is gonna be at, my hackles are raised. I'd begin thinking dating this person was actually a bad idea and seriously consider unmatching and blocking the person. 

So many red flags.
That makes a lot of sense and is more context than just being in a park, thanks for the clarification!

  
I live in a city and often suggest parks as a first date option because it lowers cost, either of us can bail immediately (no waiting for a check from waitstaff) and unless we are going deep into the trails on the bigger parks, they are popular spots often filled with families with children, crafting and language groups, and exercise groups doing stuff like CrossFit and tai chi, so they generally feel safe.

  
Good luck on the dating front!
I never know what to say, though when we “go for a walk” my roommate says we “tootle”. We need more mobility words!"
Saying ‘No I can’t take care of you’ and disability justice. How much is too much/not enough? ,25,disability,"Even when people are getting paid (I have a mobility disability and home health aides), still it is the responsibility of the disabled person to have depth of care and be responsive to the stated and unspoken needs of their caregivers. That way, everyone avoids burnout and resentment.  

Home health aides are often grossly under compensated and many folks work way long weeks, providing crucial services, and because some degree of emotional bond almost always forms, it’s frequently difficult for caregivers to let themselves be  unavailable.
That makes a lot of sense. I can’t imagine it would be easy to have a caretaker say ‘no’ last minute to something like transportation. Thank you for sharing!
I’ve heard stories from a lot of people that the  assumption that disabled people who use mobility aids need help when none has been asked and it sounds deeply, deeply frustrating and awful. In your experience, does this also extend to people asking if you need help? What are things you wished ambulatory people knew?  "
How to develop self-love after disability ,8,disability,">I come from a dysfunctional family to boot. I've escaped my cult after decades of abuse and cut my family and friends all off and had to start over with no one.

The op can't easily do this. She has zero income and mobility issues. So is stuck in her room and will probably be with her family and zero real-life friends unless something changes. She is also in Asia if that helps anyone.

>I use a friendship app to swipe for friends

You should post a link to the app that you use so the op can also use it. 😊

>I am in hobby groups because I have tons of hobbies to keep me company so I'm not depending solely on other humans to keep me entertained.

I assume that you are either looking for ideas or help with your hobbies in these groups. That or you are helping others. Having something to keep your mind busy.

>Meanwhile, therapy should be a high priority with all these negative judgment and assumptions you're harboring.

She might need free and online therapy as she is stuck in her room without income."
Ways to play with my cats more? ,3,disability,"You sound like me! I love tubes and my cats do too! There are many different kinds and lengths and they can fold up for when you need more room. They’re fun to lay down next to and use the cat wands around allowing the cats to “hunt” from inside or behind the tubes. It makes playtime more engaging since I can’t run around with them.

Other than that of course a laser for when they want to run fast but I have to stay in bed. 

Cat trees are great for them to get their climbing in. 

I also sometimes walk them around the block in a stroller so I can use the stroller for support when I walk for exercise. 

Have fun!"
Disabled Mom struggling to take care of baby- Advice needed,42,disability,"My mum has gotten progressively more disabled as my life has gone on. One of my first memories is getting her cane for her so she could get out of bed. I still love her and wouldn’t trade her for anything, and while I sometimes wish that we could’ve done more physical activities together, I never really thought about it until other people pointed it out. I have grieved with her as her health gets worse, but I’m also very grateful that as I’ve developed my own health issues in the last few years that I’ve had someone in my corner who really gets it. No one understands me like my mum *because* she is a disabled parent. She’s also instilled so much compassion in me, and even before I got sick I was much more aware of accessibility needs and ableism than others my age. I’m so blessed to be able to say that her disability has made me a better person. Your child will likely grieve some of the differences in their childhood when they get older, but that will not be the defining characteristic of their life or their relationship with you. Raise them to be kind, compassionate, and resilient. Raise them to know it’s ok to rest even if the masses insist on the hustle and grind culture. Raise them to adapt and have fun with your disability (nothing like decorating a mobility aid to make it flashy haha). 

Sorry I don’t have more practical advice, but I hope this helps. My mum and I have had issues of course, but they aren’t because she’s disabled.
Thank you! I know I try my best to show that to both my baby and my stepson. I have a really close relationship with my stepson despite him being a sports kid and me not being able to very limited sports things with him: I needed that reminder"
Is it.. bad I have a hard time admitting I am disabled?,29,disability,"There's no disability fairy that comes and waves a magic wand and all of a sudden someone is branded ""officially disabled"". For some, yes, there is a defining singular moment. Maybe they became disabled after a traumatic injury, or were disabled at birth. But for a lot of us, we have a gradual decline in health and then have to figure out where we stand and how we feel about it. And it can be a hard thing to wrap our heads around because it's something we have to decide for ourselves.  

Disability is not a dirty word. But society conditions us to believe it is. So yes, it's very normal to have trouble attaching that label to yourself. Everyone becomes disabled eventually, whether it's at age 15 or 85. I didn't feel comfortable calling myself disabled for a year or two after being diagnosed and needing to use mobility aids full-time, even though I'm sure others would have thought of myself as disabled long before then. You're at the beginning of your own journey, and there's a long path ahead. Ultimately it's up to you when on that path you feel comfortable giving yourself a label.
I personally don't think it's bad. I do understand that it can be hard admitting that tho. Have struggled with that a lot myself. I've been dealing with multiple mental health issues since childhood, and after quite a few failed attempts at working, I wound up on disability as an adult. I wasn't happy with it, but I eventually accepted it. Since I have what's considered to be an invisible disability, it hasn't been easy navigating society. After a mild bout of COVID three years ago, we discovered that I have a chronic illness on top of all the mental health issues, and I've had it since my teens. Tbh, this diagnosis came as no surprise. Still, it's been a struggle to accept this. And the chronic illness has been worsening the last several years. It's invisible for the most part now (meaning I don't use any mobility aids), but I may wind up bedbound one day. I've already been getting more housebound as this has worsened. My ability to do day to day stuff has been deteriorating, and it's been so frustrating and scary. I don't want to have this chronic illness or all of these mental health issues. I want to be healthy and able-bodied too. :'(
No! This is absolutely normal and something we all go through and have to come to terms with. It's a real mind f*ck at first, but I promise you it will get easier day by day as it becomes your new norm. Do not feel insecure if people stare at you either! In a lot of people's minds, they invision disability with elderly and seem (are) surprised to see anyone under the age of 65 with a mobility aid... Ignore them or simply make eye contact, and they will look immediately look away, lol"
dealing with disabilities?,0,disability,"Your sports, working out etc doesn't need to be taken away from you. I'm in a wheelchair & keep plenty fit for a 45yr old. I do marathon distances for fun, go out for 10 mile 'rolls' a few times a week. I do okay. We know how good exercise is for mental health. 

A disability doesn't necessarily mean 'the end'. 

I totally understand how you're feeling, my disability started with pain when walking before I ended up losing a leg & ending up in a chair, I felt like my life had been torn from me & honestly I spent a few years in a dark place (not all due to my failing legs), but honestly my life right now is the best it's been. Ever.

Note: I am in no way saying that because you have pain in your leg, that you'll end up in a wheelchair. So please don't read what I've said & panic.
Hi I'm 17 but I was diagnosed with my disability at 14, i use a cane and custom leg braces to walk better and sometimes use a wheelchair. I dance and used to do musical in school and a bunch of other activities. I still dance but I no longer do a lot of my other activities. I at first also felt like everything was taken away from me too. But you can still try to do the things you love it just is a lot harder and you may not be able to do things even when you really want to or try hard to. I'm a dancer I still dance like I said but I often fall or am too painful to dance nor can I dance as good as I used to but I do what I can and take breaks when I must. Some advice I have is do not over work yourself and talk to someone about your disability such as your sport's coach if you feel comfortable enough to do so, they can hopefully understand your situation and they might even have some advice you can try. For instance I did musical 2 years ago and am currently talking to the teacher that runs it to see if I'm able to preform or work something out to work back stage this year. It is unfair to not be able to do the things you like doing and I wish I could say everything was the same when my disability worsened about 2 years ago but it would be a lie. Not everything is easy and I ofc don't know you or your disability but you can still try or try with accommodations because I've learned that even though my disability plays a huge role in my daily life I can still try and not give up on what I love doing. If you don't at least try you will never know what you're capable of even with a disability, there are so many things I gave up when things got hard and I won't lie and say I don't think about giving up dancing almost every day but I love doing it and loving my activities for me wins over how much I have to put in to keep going. I'm very sorry to hear you are dealing with this, it's definitely hard to say what will happen, everyone is different and I hope the best for you
thank you so so much for this, i barely see anybody my age also working with disabilitys, and reading this gave me alot of relief! im glad to hear that you can still do the things you enjoy, even with difficulty. i will definitely speak to my coach and such on things to do so i can still play my sport for the season"
ada seating at concerts,5,disability,"If you know a concert is coming up you want ADA seating at, call the box office the morning of the sales and get ready to buy. They will ask if you have mobility or another disability, like Deaf/interpreter or CART services, or legally blind, etc, and give you some seating options. 
Make sure you have your accessible parking tag as well, from your doctor"
Does the C word bother anyone else?,82,disability,"I've used it a handful of times for myself, but I decided that I didn't like the way it sounded or felt. It made me really uncomfortable. Just like the F slur used towards queer people, like myself. 

I prefer to say that I'm disabled, or just that I require a mobility aid. Although I don't like it when people call my cane ""a stick"".

In both cases, it makes me feel like there's a negative connotation, like I'm being looked down upon for my needs. It makes me worry for when I will eventually need to start using a wheelchair.
Yes I hate it when others use it. I use it in reclamation and as a part of disability pride but every time someone says “cripple the economy” or “oh they’re crippled” or “crippling anxiety” I actually get so pissed and annoyed and sad and angry about how little people understand the history of the word and the violence associated with it. In my opinion, it should only be used by people with mobility disabilities and only as an act of positive reclamation, never should it be used to connotative something bad"
"I don't want my disabled ex to be homeless, but I need them to move out. ",110,disability,"Did your ex also suffer from chronic pain? Mine has chronic pain, a dissociative disorder, and no car. We live in the middle of nowhere, so unless he moves to a place with public transportation, he won't be able to travel on his own. He's in therapy twice a week, and seems more concerned about unpacking years worth of trauma then finding a way out of his current situation. I don't know if he understands how badly I want him gone. I wish he was trying a little harder. Maybe spending more time researching and less time crocheting or playing on the computer. He says he needs the dopamine. I can't tell if I'm being ableisit.
I don't believe they have the mental facilities to take care of themself or plan an exit strategy. I'm starting to wonder if they safest place for them is a living facility with staff on hand. I don't understand how they made it through college... I'd really like them to get a job in their field, but I think they'd need to relocate to somewhere with public transport."
How to Cope,12,disability,"I used to run track in middle school and high school. Fairly fast but not the best. 51 second 400m, could never break the 50 second barrier sadly. After high school I went into the military because my parents were already paying for my brothers’ college. I didn’t want to be another financial burden and the military was a solution. Few years of service later, I developed knee problems. My fastest two mile in high school was 10:59, not stellar but above average for the most part. After those years of service, knees just worn out, cannot even do 20 minute two miles. And that’s just depends on if I even last the two miles.

And then this past year, I got into a motorcycle accident. Leg was twisted and I was confined to a wheelchair during my initial healing process. Nothing broken, but my tendon was really bad. My knee for that leg is now maltracking and I am stuck with my cane. If I walk without a cane, my leg makes very **very audible popping and cracking noises.** And don’t get me started on the distance I can walk.

I can run, but after a minute of running I basically have to sit. And my running is a shadow of what it used to be. Compared to where I used to be, it has been a slow descent through depression. 

My advice is to get therapy to help navigate your feelings. My coping mechanisms is the gym. I can still go to the gym and machine workouts and do pull ups and dips and other things that don’t involve heavy lifting with my legs. But I suppose what I’m trying to say is you shouldn’t narrow your headspace just because it feels like the world is closing in.

Seek help and improve yourself at your own pace.

My anticipatory anxiety is hitting hard tonight,3,disability,"You might be able to ask your case worker at Social security or your insurance company if there are any resources that could help you, like you may be eligible for an in-home carer or help getting groceries delivered. I'd also like to say that I'm in the same boat. I'm 32 as well, mostly house bound & rely on my mom for housing & transportation. I know how isolating it all is & I'm sorry you're going through this."
"Disability-intolerant family member, how to handle?",44,disability,"Ugh, its a parent too? Been there done that... my father was certain that there was nothing wrong with me except that I was fat (I was 150lbs at 5'4""). He changed my diet and my exercise routine so strictly that my POTS and EDS and Narcolepsy all got so much worse. I also now struggle with my eating habits because of that time in my life. Funny thing is he just had his first bout with covid (I know, its insane esp considering he only got vaxxed once) but now he is showing symptoms of long covid and covid-resultant POTS and he refuses to go to a doctor or anything and he's just giving up. In a drunken ramble, he admitted to my mom (his ex-wife) that he thinks he may have cancer... it sucks big time. 

Im sorry, I know firsthand how hard it is to have a parent do that shit to you."
were my expectations of PT too high?,3,disability,"Pt should defo be better than that, I’d try to find a different person or a diff location if you can. The ones ive kept have listened. Had me do the exercises with them to make sure I have correct form and it didn’t hurt and would listen to what parts of it hurt me or not
Many PTs don't know how to work with hypermobility. Your experience is not uncommon but it shouldn't be standard. Hypermobility is a complex issues because building strength is super important but you need to limit stretching because the movements that feel natural aren't usually within a healthy range. My old PT was constantly telling me to make smaller movements. 

If you can find a PT in your area that is experienced with hypermobility, you are likely to have a better experience, but they are hard to find, I still haven't found one.
I have had similar experiences with physiotherapy, but also some good ones. Physiotherapy with a focus on pain management worked better for me than a focus on mobility. That's because it was almost impossible to do difficult but helpful exercises until I learnt to manage my pain more (although pain and mobility are connected). I also had the experience of being basically told ""stop doing that and move like a normal person"" like it had just never occurred to me to try?! But now its extremely obvious I can't do that. 

I don't understand their comment about range of movement. If you're hyperextending your knees, it sounds like your range of movement is *too much -* it can go the other way. 

General physiotherapists seem uniquely terrible at dealing with hypermobility, although its slowly changing. Don't give up!
Youre not exagerrating, hypermobility sucks. You need to find a PT who specifically knows a lot about hypermobility. Most don't have a clue about it. 


However even with a hypermobility informed PT, you likely will be expected to self-advocate, and the main focus will be exercises. Unfortunately we have to teach ourselves a lot and fight for ourselves


Try your best to figure out what your personal goals are (ex. more support with mobility day-to-day to increase function, self-care, etc, and preserve energy so you can actually do the exercises), and practice asking for help with them, and write questions up ahead of time. Also write down your limitations (ex. can't stand with your knees bent). The more prepared you are the better it goes. It sucks because it's a lot of effort and I wish theyd take more initiative, but they don't, so we have to :(


Good luck!
If you are interested in mobility aids, braces, etc, mention those specifically too"
"""fall risk"" question",56,disability,"If you have anemia that causes any sort of dizziness that’s gonna go under the fall risk category. If you’re inpatient in a hospital and have a known chronic illness with any mobility issues they’ll probably put you as a fall risk. 
What’s OI stand for
I was a nurse for 25+ years. 90% is a fall risk. Old, under 18, medications, mobility devices, medical conditions, history of falls, etc👌🏽
All patients have “ the right to fall and sue”. We have a right to cover our butts legally, everyone is clumsy and has blame in their fall.
that makes sense! in my case this was from a neurosurgeon consult & a referral for a full-body bone scan, but that might become relevant when i have a surgery at the end of this month that might affect my mobility during recovery
i didn't bring up mobility aids (which i use every once in a while) at the appointment where this was noted down (the photo is from my records), just the fact i fainted & fell"
[Rant] Endless cycle of getting worse because condition makes it harder to seek care,18,disability,"Exercise with a disability can be so mundane and frustrating. I have a gym membership but I do the lightest weights on every machine and even that’s hard. Are you able to save up to buy resistance bands? They are a much cheaper alternative than weights and honestly more suitable for people with disabilities imo. I also struggle with motivating to workout myself. It can be so demoralizing doing barley any exercise and just being exhausted and knowing you won’t get much stronger. But I try to tell myself it’s better to move your body a little rather than not all. It will further progress our weaknesses being stagnant. I hope you find some good workouts that work for you!
If you'd like to be more active without a gym membership I highly recommend Hybrid Calisthenics. He has a website and a youtube channel. On the site there are very easy variations of every exercise that are comparable to physical therapy. If you can't do a pushup for example there is a guideline for working up to a single pushup with wall pushups, then inclined pushups, etc. No equipment strictly necessary and there are suggestions for low cost set ups if you do want some equipment.

In the end though remember that it's okay to not be where you were before and to not push yourself past your limits to perform to abeled standards. Moving your body is good! But if you can never get to a full pushup or pull up ( I couldn't), doing the easier variations is still worth it to keep your joints healthy. Anything at all is better than nothing. If you're to the point where walking up the stairs or even sitting up from a chair is exercise, that is okay. 

Also second what the other commenter said about resistance bands! I was using the smaller ones and with some youtube walkthroughs you can get a really great workout in a tiny bedroom. Good luck!"
Lack of seating,28,disability,"Not that this is relevant or necessary information to justify my complaint, but yes, I have multiple mobility aids, and regardless, my disability is inconsistent and tumultuous.

A #spoonie has a bracelet or a small wallet card to notify 911 of a disability. 
A #complexspoonie has a life alert button and 2 sided 8.5 x 11"" paper full of text explaining all 15 conditions/diseases they somehow live with.
I'm on disability for a rare incurable disease that has destroyed the mobility of my arms, hands, legs, and feet.

And I am neither depressed nor have anxiety.

I am the complete opposite, working hard every single day to have the best quality of life I can.

Perspective. It can change everything about life in a second.

Stay strong 💪
I hate you Had To go Through with that. Just tired of ignorant Ableist people sometimes 

Yeah Your Reasons For being on Disability is Valid 

Just Made me Also think about my personal experience with people like that 

Like it makes me Very Sad that Some people don't understand 

How Much Non Visible as well as Visible Disabilities effects people 

Well for me I have Severe Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder 

And bipolar disorder and unspecified PTSD, And recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability 

Just get tired Of The Abled body making disability like the Olympics 

Like people have to compete with each other to see if they Disabilities are severe enough for disability 

Which true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function 

Which this does 

Which I have Agoraphobia I'm the opposite I can't Be Around people 

I can't even go to the Hospital without having a panic attack 

like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent 

Because I still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function 

Only time I leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult 

But I live alone don't really have support 

Since I look so Normal and functional unfortunately 

Plus people think because I'm a black man I'm immune to being disabled or having a disability 

Just kinda hard Because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community 

It effects me daily 

It's detrimental on my economic status 

It's hard to just text and talk on the phone 

Even right now I'm getting a headache 

But it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability 

Try to explain to ignorant people that are Ableist like you dealt with 

I'm quite the opposite I can't stay with people I would have a panic attack unfortunately 

It's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis 

Like they force you to share rooms which aggravates my disabilities.

And aggravates my anxiety PTSD symptoms as well 

Just everyones disability effects people differently 

Mines kinda severe to me 

Like Hate the Competition Thing abled body people created 

Sound like people have to compete with each other like freaking capitalism 

Just for Disability payments 

I hate that 

I wouldn't apply for disability if I didn't need it 

I felt so much guilt younger

People saying my disability is not severe because they can't see it 

Or people always assume you faking it 

Since mental illness they quote you can fake 

Which makes me very upset 

Because they will never know how I feel in my body and mind 

If only that knew they wouldn't be saying that 

And by the way Disability payments can't even cover Rent payments 

A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is over 1500$ for the worst area 

So probably pushing 2000$+ for a good area

Just make me upset and triggered 

Because I have no reason to make up how my disability effects my life daily 

People are so ignorant with mental illness 

They assume because I'm laughing at a movie 

Or taking a selfie 

I'm faking a mental illness 

Which makes me upset 

Like My therapist tells me to watch television using coping mechanisms to distract 

Like they don't know people with disabilities don't always have bad days 

Have a bunch of bad days 

Which I do but 

I like doing the coping mechanisms my therapist taught me 

Just make me cry a little 

Because Disabilities people can't understand what they can't see

Not trying to get emotional 

Just your post resonated with my life 

Bought up bad memories I guess 

Like people think because I workout 

Which is at home by the way 

I can't handle public commercial gyms by the way 

But people assume because I'm trying to use a coping mechanism 

To cope with my disability 

That means I'm faking it 

Or using reddit as a journal like now 

Which I'm anxious as well typing this 

Just people don't understand disabilities effect people differently 

Just Ableism in society 

Might not be to abled body person that has no problems leaving their house 

Or a person that doesn't feel like a lion is being chased after him for just talking or talking on a phone 

Like I live alone but my with my disability I couldn't live with people that would make my condition worse 

I had anxiety just living with family members 

Just because I live alone people think my mental health is not severe 

That really makes me upset 

Because Disabilities effects people differently 

Mines just as severe or life altering as anyone else 

Just because I live alone doesn't mean I'm independent 

I still can't keep a job and stuff 

I don't think being independent is until I can live a functioning life 

And people that have jobs still have disabilities 

Disability effects everyone differently 

I hate this grade scale stuff 

That Ableist people use to say you not deserving of help

Just Ableism sigh

Which I tell distant family and Ableist strangers on social media sites 

I don't have to live in a group home unfortunately 

Because my anxiety would get worse and turn to a crisis 

Just I really relate to your post op 

I guess I got triggered by you quoting Ableist people that said that to you 


But hate people feel like mental illness is not taking seriously 

Which I'm not physically disabled which I definitely respect and understand 

But speaking from a Ableist person perspective 

Like they think people with mental illness or other invisible disabilities 

Should not be considered for disability 

And they always say we lazy or faking because we lazy 

Which I would love to keep a stable job 

But capitalism doesn't value that capitalism values efficiency and profit 

And doesn't value disabled people fitting in 

Not trying to rant on capitalism because I know everyone opinions is different 

I would love to work it's just hard with my conditions

Because due to Ableism they really think People getting disability checks 

That doesn't even cover a full month of rent 

Is a luxury.

Which the Lowest paying minimum wage job pays more than disability pays people.

Like This effected me for a long time 

My whole life 

Just because it gets me emotional knowing because you don't see me walking in a cane or wheelchair 

Or a Down Syndrome or something more visible 

Like I don't have those conditions I'm still disabled as them 

Autism you can't see, learning disabilities you can't see

Even some physical illnesses are invisible 

Such as Sickle Cell and Lupus 

Everything is not visible like blindness 

But my mental illness effects my life as much as any other disability effects people lives in society 

Just because I have muscle or tall black and 6'2""

Keep myself groomed 

I guess I have to look unhoused to For people to understand how my disability effects me seriously 

It's so flawed 

Invisible Disabilities doesn't work like that unfortunately 

I'm deserving of disability as much as anyone that has a disability 

Sorry for the rant OP
Don't believe those negative claims. While your physical issues may still be unclear, both anxiety and depression are treatable. I come from a family with a genetic predisposition to depression, and four years ago, I struggled with severe anxiety and depression. However, after eight months of effort, I fully recovered—without using medication or psychotherapy.



If you take the time to learn more about healing anxiety and depression through nutrition and exercise, and stick to the process, you too can achieve a full recovery.
That is a beautiful dress!

I'm on disability for horrible ptsd, bipolar 1 and anxiety, unable to handle life as a ""real person"" and now I have physical conditions that are impossible to do anything much as my mobility is super impacted.
I use multi-disabled. I have vision, hearing, mobility, dexterity and psychiatric disabilities. But I think 2 is still ""multi"". :)"
‘Disabled’,45,disability,"Ayyy I'm also 19 with several disabilities.

My mom is a Gen-xer and she had to come to terms with me being disabled at the same time she realized her herself had been disabled all her life too with three conditions I also have and she never really realized it (like many folks with Autism, Ehlers-Danlos and Narcolepsy, we both kinda thought it was normal until I started having severe sleep issues and pain). 

In a way, I think I struggle more with my own limitations that my mom struggles with them. I try so so hard to do things I know I can't. And she is always the first to remind me that NO ONE can do everything, my limitations are just harder set and more visible than others'. But instead of busting my balls to do things that hurt me, I should spend my time getting really good at the shit I do well and then trade off my skills for the things I can't do.

 Perfect example -- I'm a good cook, but I can't stand in the kitchen long enough to cook AND do dishes (between the hot water and the standing, it drives my POTS crazy). I cook and manage the food budget for me and my two roomies, and they clean up. 

Another example, my boyfriend is a brilliant mathematician and chemist, and he is physically very strong; I am neither. However, he really struggles with executive functioning (we suspect, and are in the diagnostic process, for autism). He was also raised in a *less then supportive* environment and so he is terrified of doing anything that qualifies as ""adulting"". So I help him with job searches and setting up doctors' appointments (and sometimes with writing essays), while he does the laundry and helps me with my homework. And we can both cook, so we often bicker about who is stuck with the dishes :P

Life is already fuckin' hard enough. Fighting your limitations is the human experience TO A POINT, but not to where you put yourself in harm's way. And honestly, I'm doing pretty damn good, in a lot of ways because of the paths my disabilities have led me down; I've learned about medicine to help myself when I'm sick, now I'm studying for the MCAT. I study music because I could never do sports, and it's brought so many great people into my life. Find a balance and people who are willing to trade skillsets with you. That is so much more important than trying to push past ""false limitations"" that ableists think we put on ourselves (and yeah, I hate to say it, but its definitely a form of passive/internalized ableism).

Feel free to reach out if you ever want a buddy your age. I know, at least where I live, disabled folks our age are hard to come by, and that can be pretty isolating.
No problem, I only recently found out that it’s an official organization instead of just a general name for any disability focused sport"
"What do you do when both partners in a relationship are disabled, and you both need help, but you can't help each other?",25,disability,"Comparing is never good! That only causes problems. Do not listen to people saying that, only you can judge that. People on Reddit are quick to say things like that.

I hope you get good results from the MRI, maybe something that is fixable. Hopefully with physiotherapy maybe."
Looking for advice/ opinions on accessible martial arts,2,disability,"Most adaptive sports organizations began with someone just like you, wanting to something but not knowing where to start.

You should start by contacting people who are already in the adaptive martial arts community. Most are pretty helpful and eager to help grow the field. 

Sterling Chase of [DyMyon Martial Arts](https://www.dumyonmartialarts.org/home) is super friendly, and could help answer your questions about starting and running a program. National Governing Bodies in the sport, such as [USA Judo](https://www.usajudo.com/coach-club-resources), [USA Taekwondo](https://www.usatkd.org/), and [US Jiu-Jitsu Federation](https://www.usjjf.org/united-states-para-jiu-jitsu-reg-program.html) have resources to help you get started. 

Searching ""adaptive [martial arts discipline]"" may also yield existing programs in your area to explore. Once you're set up, [AbilitiesExpo ](https://www.abilities.com/) can help you as a venue for demonstrations and networking with local rehabilitation center employees."
"""Survival Jobs"" are not disability friendly.",192,disability,"I feel this. I can’t stand for basically any period of time without assistance (from mobility aids or walls/people) and I have massive brain fog issues. I also have an amnesia disorder so I have a really hard time remembering things. I can’t have a job where I need to stand (so most retail) or take orders and things. I worked retail for a while, but I had to call out a lot for pain or other chronically ill things. Luckily for that job they let me sit down, but I hated strict cashier days.

Before my disability got really bad, I used to be a teacher and I was forgetting things constantly, and when I asked for more time to get grading done (because I would literally forget it was there) they told me that no one else has a hard time so I just needed to buckle down and do it. This came from the same vice principal who asked me what having accommodations would do for me in the job 🙄 not to mention my chronic fatigue and insomnia would lead to me having micro naps sometimes, or the one time where I passed out in front of the students.

While I’m glad I don’t have to worry about that any more, some people act like I’m happy that my college degree is going to waste"
"good desk chairs? muscle, spine, & circulation/nerve problems",1,disability,"My HM chair has been an actual life changer. I have so much less pain and neuropathy now. There was a period in the first two months where it was much worse as my body slowly readapted to being in the correct posture and I was convinced I'd made a horrible mistake but it's actually given me a lot of mobility back. That said a lot of those clearance sites are scams. What you can do if find them often in used office supply stores and the parts are readily available
I have EDS and hypermobility and I mostly sit on a mat or cushion on the floor."
