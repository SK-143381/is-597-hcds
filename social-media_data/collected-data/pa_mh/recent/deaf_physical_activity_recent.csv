Deaf- friendly yoga,22,deaf,"How structured are your classes?  If they are structured very well, you could have a powerpoint type presentation on a screen, showing the pose from different angles than the participants would see you AND some text describing it.

If it's heavily unstructured, then you have some issues to tackle.  You could make an index of all the different positions you are likely to do and have someone click through and show the above as you transition from one pose to another.

> Are there any good voice to text devices I could have available?

There are 2 kinds:

 * Ones with humans involved that tend to cost a lot, but do a great job
 * AI driven ones that are cheap/free and tend to do a better than nothing job.

The AI driven ones change all the time, and some do better than others, you need to try various ones to see which will do the best in your particular situation. They are not 100% accurate. Most of the time, given good voice input, they are reasonably accurate, but they tend to lose out on anything complicated or out of the ""normal"". They also almost never get nuance correctly.  For your application, that might not matter, but you need to try the different ones and see which seems to work best for your situation in your classes. To help it succeed, wear a microphone and use that as the input.

Also, if you haven't seen Apple Fitness+, they do some ASL at the beginning of the class, and have captions. It might give you some inspiration, and teach you some ASL you can use in your classes.
This is exactly why I've never been able to enjoy or get into yoga. I can't hear the instructor, can't wear my hearing aids, and can't follow along. It has just felt like an exercise in frustration every single time. Like - I've left every single class just feeling depressed and irritated. 

Maybe if I were already experienced or had more of a baseline of yoga knowledge it wouldn't be so tough, but for me, there are just other forms of exercise I enjoy more, so those are what I do. 

For me personally I think it would require very small class sizes (5 or 6 max) with more time for 1:1 attention and instruction. But I don't know if that's financially viable."
Waardenburg Syndrome,11,deaf,"""That happens with tinnitus""?! Does it? I've never heard of that!  
I'm assuming we're both in the UK so the ENT dr prescribed initially.  I must've got referred to the hospital with sudden 'idiopathic' hearing loss and literally the only treatment they have is steroids. (I have a dead left ear and mod/severe loss in the good ear so when that pops off its total silence).

As it's so hard to get an appt in an ENT emergency (I've gone through A&E at one point)  I got the ENT to write to the GP with the prescription so I can just obtain it when it happens and give myself the dose. They can also administer injections straight into the cochlear but I've never had that as I really don't fancy it. All ENT drs assume you can just stroll in and get your appt which is never the case. 

I think they should be treating your losses as sudden hearing loss, an emergency. For your reference my dosage is Prednisolone 5mg : 60mg for 7 days, 40mg for 3 days, 20mg for 3. They've no idea how it works,  it either brings down inflammation or it switches off the immune system in case your body is attacking itself.  Either way, it seems to work and I won't risk it without it. I take it the moment my hearing drops off.
 
With the vaccines the loss hit more or less 30 days after the jab each time so there was a question mark over it till I saw the pattern. The vaccines were designed to fire up the immune system so I think mine got overfired but m not alone, there are many reports on the net of this happening, even down to the 30 days later. Prior to vacvines  it seems to occur when I get a virus, but not always. Next time it happens they want me to go up to ENT as its happening to get an audiogram/ blood test etc but honestly I feel so awful when it does I'm reaching for the steroids straight away. 

Obviously they'd have to weigh up if OK for you to take them if you're on any other medications but I don't see why not. Rather tolerate horrible steroids for a few days than lose a bit more hearing permanently. 

Oof on the mould! I'm not a fan of audiologists in the main from previous experience. I have open fit but even I know with severe  hearing loss you need a closed mould. It sounds like you haven't been helped at all.  I didn't get a hearing aid till my 30s and according to my notes should've had one from 5 years old for my good ear - wasn't told. Its hard to aclimatise later on when you've just got on with it. 

Yes dominant gene. We're just discovering it now but it seems noone else in the family has exhibited any traits.   My dad has just been telling me how he used to have to do ankle exercises as a child to straighten out his legs...hmm!  I don't think it's anything like EDS but it's weird that we have these little things. I could live in high heels they're must easier than flats! 

Sorry for the essay!"
Clown Class Question,1,deaf,"Perfect!!! My class has been studying/watching Tony Montanero (a famous mime who was taught by one of the greats, don't remember which) and working on LaCoq's gondola exercise (where you mime rowing a gondola as a repetitive and neutral motion). Happy to avoid actual sign language signs! Thank you so much for your answer. <3"
Physical therapist seeking advice,9,deaf,"One thing I’ll add that I didn’t see mentioned is making sure your patient can see the interpreter during exercises. So if you have an idea of what things you might be doing with her based on her medical record, make sure there’s enough space and positioning for the interpreter. If it’s going to be something awkward because she is on the floor or something, perhaps work out a signal if there is some verbal feedback you need to give. PT is hard work for patients so she may be more focused on the exercises and may need moments to pause to communicate or for you to offer guidance."
My daughter had a terrible year physically and I’m worried about her mental stability,26,deaf,"Are there deaf schools in your area? She'll be able to play sports just fine once she recover.
I am also an athlete and I am passionate about my sport. I've gone through a torn knee; it is a devastating injury and it was hard on me. One thing I want to point out with a cochlear implant, you can't have MRIs. I have an implant but I got really lucky I had a great knee specialist who was able to correctly figure out what I tore based on what happened. Only thing we didn't know was how bad the damage was and what needed to be done until he actually got in my knee on surgery day. Anyways. A torn knee can be hard on an athlete and it's unfortunate that your daughter had all those other things happening to her at the same time. She has gone through a lot in her short life and probably is processing everything.

Recovery time is a great time for you all to practice some sign language if you don't already know it. Make sure she sticks to her physical therapy. Encourage her to journal, draw, sketch if she's artistic. Get into that new routine. Try and find a local deaf teen club so she can be around others who understand what it's like to have hearing loss."
Hearing aids when doing sweaty stuff?,7,deaf,"I have these little like hearing aid socks almost? they cover the mics so the sound is still clear but the mics are protected from sweat, my mom got them for me in the 2000's when I was a child in dance and sports and now its a habit

&#x200B;

https://www.gearforears.com/
I've done both: i have made a habit of taking new HA off when doing sweaty things. but i have also left them on once older and I was feeling lazy, and it really took a LOT of sweaty stuff to make any kind of real difference. (Most of the time i took them off b/c my exercise involved tumbling -- martial arts etc -- which was more of a problem!)

High humidity areas give me more problems. Thinking about it, it may be that I'm largely ok with sweaty workouts b/c I live in southern California, and the same sort of thing wouldn't fly in say Knoxville where it apparently is never less than 100% humidity..."
Have a hard time learning sign due to my other mental disabilities,19,deaf,"- focus in on the vocab you'll use most frequently. E.g. If you're a foodie, learn food / cooking Signs. Into sports? Learn that category vocab. Signs will be more likely to stick cause you'll use them more frequently. 

- if you get stuck, *describe around* the Sign/term you're missing. E.g. HOTEL could be described as PLACE-TRAVEL-STAY-KEYCARD-HOUSEKEEPING. It's not necessary to have *the* word/Sign if you can express the context or related vocab.

Best of luck to you!"
How do those who are deaf feel about the word “disabled”?,5,deaf,"Lots of opinions. Lots of points and counterpoints. I'll give you a scattershot of a few;

pro deaf=disabled

 - It shows a form of internalised ablism and attempt to disassociate, making disabled people ""those folk over there"".
 - As per the medical model (even 'nicer' versions) disabled people lack an ability to do a thing that is statistically normal and normalised. 
 - As per the social model, society still clearly disables deaf people.
 - Most points against deaf=disabled can be critiqued with ""isn't that true for all disabilities?""

anti deaf=disabled

 - Disabled (as per the social model) is about whether your community or society disables. While broader society does disable Deaf people, the community around Deaf people does not. Once given access to community, language and communication - there is no disabling factor. There are also many global templates of what Deaf intetrated societies look like.
 - Its a trait variation that carries ability, sure, but so is ability/aptitude to do various sports or needing glasses and niether of those are considered disabilities. It can (and should be) completely normalised, or given its own cultural space, and therein be not a disability but just something that some people have like haircolour.

Personally - I think you either have to accept deaf as part of disability or use it to critique the ideology of disability completely (with the aim of bringing other disability groups along with us into whatever comes after). Doing just ""I'm deaf not disabled"" is a half-job.

Special educator- HOH/deaf Assistant,8,deaf,"Some ideas, and really, these help all TAs, not just the deaf/hoh ones…

-For any emergency information and procedures, especially for students with specific medical needs, type them up on one sheet, the largest font that will fit, laminate it onto red paper, and post it by the phone or the door. 

-it is helpful if you introduce her to people and fill them in on what they do and privately share who is good to work with and who is… not very supportive. 

-Ask if she has a preference for communicating information. I once had a TA who preferred to have a checklist of things to do each day. It was annoying and tedious to write it out, but it really did help the day go much smoother. 

-Find out what she likes and her skills. Is she a good artist? Ask her to make a bulletin board. Does she like to get outside for exercise and you need someone to walk a kid around to calm them down? Give her that task."
Any deaf-friendly way to learn Japanese?,2,deaf,"I’m just lurking because I made a new deaf friend, but this is a question I can really answer!

I think the issue is more that you haven’t found a study method that works for you rather than apps. I hardly use audio exercises myself, and since you can’t hear well, you’ll likely only need to focus on writing and grammar skills. I recommend Genki. It has audio exercises, but they’re optional. 

Most importantly, you need to find an exercise that you enjoy. Playing matching games, reading comics, writing posts online. I like those methods. I follow many Japanese people on Twitter and it keeps me sharp! What interests you? Find a way to get that content in Japanese."
I’m terrified of my own sister.,4,deaf,"This is your mom's responsibility to handle. Explain it as calmly as you can, don't call your sister names, have a solution ready. Maybe sister can play in a different room with a door closed. Maybe she can limit her gaming time to when you're at work/school/with friends. Maybe she can relieve that frustration some other way, like outdoor sports.

She is going to have to learn to regulate her volume and anger sometime, so other people don't get upset. She is going to have to learn that she can't just ignore other people's feelings and physical pain, if she wants to have any friends or a job in the future.  But it's not your job to teach her those things, it's your mom's. So:

1. Mom, I'm concerned about sister, she seems very angry and easily frustrated
2. Her frustration is causing me pain and I'm afraid it will affect my hearing
3. I've tried talking to her about this but she doesn't seem to understand
3. Can we have a family meeting to discuss how to resolve this?

Good luck. It's hard being a teenager and hard learning how to approach situations where the other person is not respecting your needs."
Help with cultural (?) divide/getting pushy deaf coworker to bugging me to learn sign language,5,deaf,"Well then.

To start off, who decides whether a person is ""normal"" or not? 

https://www.philosophytalk.org/shows/what-normal

This link goes to a more philosophical discussion (uncaptioned, but I read the listening notes). 

""Statistically, normal is the average or median of a set of data.  In a normative sense, norms are the standards by which our behavior is measured, such as morality and reason. ""


Here we can see how normal can be systematic and structural within a society, and how ""normal"" here differs from ""normal"" in Australia. Normal in America is not having healthcare, and normal in Australia is having universal healthcare, for example. 

Deafness as a whole is not the norm. Therefore, irregular or not normal! However, is that our fault? There are usually 2 paths of ""treating"" deafness, because of its inherent irregularity within society. Medical or cultural. This article divvies it up as ""pathological"" or ""cultural"".

https://www.verywellhealth.com/pathological-view-versus-cultural-view-of-deafness-1048594

This immediately makes me, a deaf person feel like I need to be ""fixed"" for a society that is not structured for people like me. I believe this is what one of the points that OP's co-worker was trying to drive home, but their approach was (seemingly) aggressive and harassing. 


Moving on to the term ""Hearing Impaired"". We all know what hearing is. I am more focused on ""Impaired"". Impaired is defined as... 

-""weakened, diminished, or damaged: to rebuild an impaired bridge.""

-""functioning poorly or inadequately: Consumption of alcohol results in an impaired driver.""

-""deficient or incompetent (usually preceded by an adverb or noun):
morally impaired; sports-impaired.)""

https://www.dictionary.com/browse/impaired?s=t

This gives us the idea that we all SHOULD be hearing. This is hugely detrimental because that assumes we all had hearing and lost it. That is not true. This gives an inherent assumption that not having full hearing is ""less than"". I understand that by default, there are limitations for us because of our hearing, because of the entire framework of society is based on hearing people!


Are we ""less than"" people that are automatically normal in society just because they can hear because it was built for them?


Ironically, I can't watch the philosophical video because its not captioned! Thats because majority of viewers are hearing and would not have a problem watching, and I am irregular. Is that my fault?


I think not.
