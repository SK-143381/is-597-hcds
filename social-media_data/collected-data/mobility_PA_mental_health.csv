The idea that men and women make up entirely separate ""communities"" that are responsible solely for themselves is oddly regressive and weird.
Mentally unhealthy people engage in self-destructive behavior and struggle to find outlets in a super isolated social environment? Who would have fucking known!?
The men's mental health stuff isn't the fault of men, it isn't the fault of women, it's the fault of society as a whole. I was raised with the idea that I'm supposed to be strong. If everyone else is sad or scared, I need to be strong, be the rock. My value is based entirely on how reliable I am, and being reliable means you don't rely on others. This is how I was raised and it wasn't just one or two people pushing these ideas. It wasn't just men, it wasn't just women. So when I had a mental health crisis, it was really hard to seek help because it went against what I was taught. Seeking help meant admitting I was sad, that I was scared, and it meant that I had to rely on others. Seeking help meant that I was a failure by every metric set for me.

Women most affected...🤦🏻‍♂️,4860,CriticalDrinker,"""They perpetuate the very behavior systems that have handicapped them in the first place, refuse to support or create a community amongst each other, severely damage the women in their lives who try to care for them...""

Yeah, I'm gonna need to see some statistical evidence that a large portion of men are actually doing that. Sounds to me like another misandrist purposefully labelling a giant chunk of the population as bad guys just because ""men bad"" again. Happens all the time.
See for example members clubs. Women's only club Albright is acceptable and a good and positive thing. Men's only club the Garrick is toxic, old fashioned and misogynist and was eventually forced to accept female members after a long running campaign by feminists and the media.

We truly live in Double Standards World
The current state of affairs:


Women’s spaces are for women, and men’s spaces are for everyone
Yeah it's fucking ironic how women wanted to get rid of the ""boy's clubs"" by invading our safe spaces, making them inclusive ones whilst still being able to have their own exclusive ""women's only"" spaces.
Our “safe spaces,” were open to everyone. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, James Bond, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings to name a few… But no… we just couldn’t have anything nice!"

I like this OOP
A lot of BORU posts the person doubles down and gets more and more deranged. I’m mildly hopeful that with the legal intervention Rob can get on the straight and narrow. At minimum he appears to be staying away from OOP which is a good sign.
Saw the title and instantly thought went ""good god, not this asshat again."" (The exbf not OOP)

Glad it was a no news is good news kind of update.
OOP should teach classes. At every stage, she immediately defended her actions and protected herself:

>...

>It ended with him telling me that I needed to put him and his family before Kim or else we weren't going to work. His family will come before mine once we are married so I should get used to it. **I went upstairs and packed a bag. I'm now at my mums house.**

>...

>He then started saying I couldn't be serious, we'd been together for 7 years and I was throwing it all away, I could never find another guy like him. **I responded to the last comment with, I dont want a guy like you that's why I'm ending it.**

Yeah er, as a big nerd who was (and still is) into all that

It's no substitute for therapy.
In Australia we have Men’s Shed which helps a lot of guys, especially older ones, to build community and talk through their issues. We also have a male specific mental health hotline (mensline) and a number of programs around the male suicide rate, getting men to talk and men in therapy.
So we can't like star wars, comics, science fiction because men feel like it's an invasion. I know there are men out there who advocate for men's mental health without being misogynists, but it's difficult to remember they exist at all. That post has 50k likes. 50 thousands men who view women's mere presence as an invasion
nobody is stopping these people from having a male-only friend group for star wars stuff or for a dnd campaign. Are they just mad that women also have interests?"

Women invaders,889,BlatantMisogyny,"> Men had sci fi, women invaded

Margaret Cavendish, Mary Shelley, Alice Bradley Sheldon (James Tiptree Jr.), Ursula Le Guin, Octavia Butler: Are we a joke to you?
Absofuckinglutely not. I didn’t spend my childhood getting made fun of for being a nerd, to then being accused of being a fake gamer girl, for this sweaty ballsack to imply that I’ve invaded on his turf.
Even if those were all men-only spaces, it wouldn’t help. They’re all consumerist spaces, not therapeutic or communal spaces to nurture lasting relationships or seek personal healing or growth.

You can watch all the Star Wars you want, it doesn’t change that “men’s mental health issues” or “the male loneliness epidemic” will take introspection, empathy, and actual work to overcome. But men don’t want to do that. They want women to cater to them, silent and staying out of their direct line of sight unless fucking them or telling them everything they want to hear.

"TheCriticalDrinker and Destiny argue at each other on Twitter over men’s mental health, safe spaces, and incel pandering.",861,youtubedrama,"I knew as soon as I saw the Destiny tweet there was 0% chance of Drinker actually making an argument. I wish they would at least pretend to have a reason beyond vibes for their beliefs.
I can see why he’s the Critical Drinker and not the Critical Thinker. The man doesn’t have two brain cells rubbing together to form a coherent thought so he ends up sounding like a fucking drunk.
As a woman who is into some stereotypically “male” media and hobbies, I’d love for any chud who agrees with CD to explain to me - where exactly are these magical communities where women are supposedly welcomed with open arms and even pandered to???

Little story for y’all - I went to a local nerd convention that had a whole section dedicated to pro wrestling merch. I went with my boyfriend who is not a wrestling fan in the slightest, didn’t even really watch as a kid. I was in full cosplay as The Undertaker (mid 90’s purple gloves gear, if you’re familiar). *Every single vendor* looked straight at my boyfriend, cheerfully greeted him, and asked him if there was anything in particular he was looking for that they could help with. Every time, he explained that I was the wrestling fan - whereupon they looked at me, saw the costume, and went “oh. Right”. Most of them then proceeded to give me the cold shoulder and ignore me when I asked for help finding something, while still trying to make conversation with my boyfriend as he explained over and over *that he had no idea what they were talking about*. 

So. I’m begging y’all. PLEASE tell me where these wonderful spaces are where shit like the above never happens, because in 2024 the “woke left” has decided that women MUST be included, and to not include us is punishable by public execution or some shit. I would be eternally fucking grateful. 

So-called “men’s hobby spaces” are STILL “men’s hobby spaces” even when we’re allowed in (lord knows men like CD would literally just refuse us entry at the door if they could), because so many of y’all for some reason see us as imposters, or refuse to see us at all. And then you complain that you can’t find a gf who shares your interests. Womp womp. 

Sorry. I have Feelings™️ about this topic. 

✨ ETA: I just wanna put a sincere Thank You here for the people in the replies who are listening to me, validating my experience and adding your own stories (that goes for people of *all* genders - I’m super glad to see men here engaging respectfully and adding their perspectives and experiences). This got way bigger of a response than I expected and I’m genuinely so grateful to y’all for engaging in this dialogue productively 💖
It's interesting how chuds suddenly don't have a problem with safe spaces when their hobbies start getting a little too diverse for their liking.

Also lol at Drinker's first tweet because that's literally the opposite of what actually happens irl. Women are constantly discouraged from hanging/interacting in mostly male spaces (see: the tech industry, comic and video game fandoms) and when they do finally form their own spaces, incels just starting whining about how it's unfair that they can't join and feel excluded."

And how’s that working for you, Sir?
Therapy isn't gendered, what the fuck lol This is some ""only women have feelings"" type bullshit. This is what happens when we don't raise boys to be emotionally aware of themselves and others like girls are. Even CBT would be immensely helpful for most men who have no idea what they are feeling or what those feelings look or feel like in their bodies. Having a good workout routine can definitely improve your mental health, but the gym =/= therapy.
i don’t want those competitions, i enjoy some competition yes but i really like quiet cozy *safe* spaces

or the bathroom, i tend to cry in the bathroom a lot, it’s actually bad

Mental Health in NZ - help,310,auckland,"You need to call your GP's office. There are two appointments you need to book: the GP to get some medicine for your bipolar, and the health improvement practitioner for talk therapy (this is free). GP will refer you to psychiatrist if needed.

If you don't think you can hold on until Monday, call the [crisis team](https://info.health.nz/mental-health/mental-health-services/crisis-assessment-teams).

You can take unpaid leave if you have run out of sick leave.  You need to tell your boss, in writing, about your mental health issues, especially if they are the type that will ""make you redundant"". This hopefully will make them think twice from making up excuses to make you redundant, and gives you comeback to take your company to ERA for disability discrimination if it comes to that.
If nothing else (over the weekend), go to an A&E or a hospital, please. 

After the weekend, visit your/a GP. 

Sorry things are shit. 

Look after yourself. I hope you feel better.
I've sent you a PM,

Op, You're never alone in this.

Please reach out. :)

I really appreciate the advice and personal stories as it is really helping me a. feel like there is a way out b. I am not alone and others have conquered what I’m feeling before. So please feel free to keep commenting, it greatly helps and it can help the next person who is feeling like me and sees this thread. I can’t give much at the moment but this; you are literally saving my life. Thank you.*
Been here myself and definitely echo what everyone is saying - call crisis or get to an ED. 
- They might be able to get you some psychiatric meds or a sleeping pill so you can get some rest. 
- They should be able to help with a medical note to get some extended sick leave from work, though it may be unpaid. 
- Call 111 if you think you're imminently at risk. Yes the police triaging system is changing but they'll still be there if someone is going to or is attempting suicide

Your GP on Monday will be your primary port of call in the future, so try and book in as soon as you can.

I love how they’re like “CANT EVEN TALK ABOUT MENS MENTAL HEALTH WITHOUT A WOMAN TALKING DOWN”
 
When the comment is someone saying “men’s mental health matters” over and over. Okay? What an enlightening discussion. Like, is he telling men their mental health matters? Or is he scolding women as if we haven’t been begging men to deal with this themselves.
all the comments about “men’s safe spaces being invaded” are like… sports clubs. or boy scouts. or gentlemen’s clubs. places where women were routinely demeaned, and sexist rhetoric was applauded. and places that have NOTHING to do with helping men feel more vulnerable and safe.

and they claim women “invading” means their spaces are “catered” to women. what does that mean? does that mean you get called out for objectifying women? do you have to become aware of your own damaging ideologies? boohoo.

men deserve safe spaces, but they have to learn not to pollute those safe spaces with sexism. IT’S ALL PATRIARCHY, AND IT HURTS ALL OF US.

Only seeing baby once a week has led MIL to say she nearly ‘k herself’ Entitled much ?,285,motherinlawsfromhell,"Change your locks immediately. 

And if she threatens to kill herself, call 911.
Your husband needs to get into therapy to help him deal with this.

Someone threatening to kill themselves should not be left alone with a baby and I would tell her that.  Along with how she needs to be discussing that in her therapy not how terrible she ""thinks"" her son is.  Has she made threats like this before?  Maybe when your husband was younger to get him to do what she wanted?

I wouldn't take the key, she probably has copies.  Just change the locks, get a door bell camera and maybe some other cameras.  When she shows up when you told her not to call the cops, explain the situation and how she has made those threats.

The calling you rude for breastfeeding says it all.  She does not really care about your daughter or her needs just herself and what she wants.  How could anyone call feeding a hungry baby rude!
Thank you so much everyone for your comments. Honestly, it has been so hard to be gaslighted into believing we’re the bad ones and it’s so refreshing to see so many people understand and reassure us that we’re not going insane! It’s her! 

We’re going to take on the advice of no contact. We have a camera and we will be changing the locks. 

We are not going to let her ruin any more of what is meant to be the best time of our lives. We tried for so long to conceive our daughter, so I am done with letting her ruin any more of it. 

Thank you again, reddit family ❤️
Tell her she's to unstable to be alone with the child and until she shows improvement she can't come over. Also get the key back.
First thing you do is change your locks and put up cameras. If she ever again says she wants to kill herself call her bluff by calling the police. Bet that'll be the last time she uses suicide as a weapon. Time to go NC and tell her she is on a 6 month time out probation. She is extraordinarily pushy, verbally abusive and frighteningly unhinged. I wouldn't let her have one second alone with your baby let alone a whole day and I dont blame you for saying no and walking out on her bullshit."

Swimming has been amazing sensory somatic therapy for me,254,CPTSDNextSteps,"I started swimming last year because the apartment I moved to has an outdoor pool. I would go swimming at night and it felt so serene and peaceful. The lights around created this beautiful view and sometimes I would have birds singing next to me.

I’m so glad you’ve found swimming to be therapeutic and I hope others can find joy in it too :)
Humming a song under water while doing laps is also quite therapeutic as a lot of trauma is stored in the throat region.
Could not agree more, swimming is my absolute number one most favorite thing to do of all time. There's a pool where I live now and it sounds kind of dramatic but the positive impact to my mental health has been immeasurable, I am in that thing and grateful every single day, usually more than once. Something about the movement and the uniform sensory experience of temperature/pressure on the skin, it makes me feel so safe and calm.
My therapist actually recommended swimming to me, but I feel self conscious just being a doggy paddler at the nice gym lap pool which is the only pool in my area
Thats wonderful

As a guy in their mid 30’s who’s watched the gaming/comic book/movie fanbases expand over the years during the 2000’s to now, my viewpoint is the more the merrier.  This gate keeping bullshit is just that, bullshit.  People like Drinker and others, whether they’re just doing it for the grift and/or they really feel this way are just hating to hate.  Same dudes that say they need more women around but what they’re thinking is old gaming convention floor models.

As far as the “invading space” perspective, I’ve never felt that way.  I welcome more people into that space, it’s finding and maintaining your peace is what’s more important to me.  Some days it’s when I’m alone working on myself or progress my career and other days it’s when I’m surrounded by friends and family.

Sometimes the realization of trauma we experienced in life doesn’t pop up until much later in life, years after we endured it. I didn’t know I was sexually groomed for a good chunk of my childhood until I was much older in my life. Then the emotions come tumbling in.

When that happens, the best thing you can do for yourself is find therapy. That will give you the closure you seek in this relationship you experienced in your past. I’m proud of you for stepping away when you did and seeing the signs and protecting yourself. And I’m also so sorry that you had to experience the awful things your ex did to you. 

Healing is a process, and wounds can unfortunately reopen sometimes. You can heal again. This is going to sound corny, but one of my favorite lyrics from a song says “What’s the meaning of this scar, if we don’t learn how to heal?”. Remember that.

His whole thing reads like it's straight out of some conservative propaganda about drugs. Just like those fake halloween candy stories, ain't nobody handing out free drugs.

just keep it simple. I'm not a fan of cars. I prefer to take the train. you do you, he does him.

life's too short to spend your time getting upset with other people.
Tell him to stop bothering you about cars. He is the definition of car brain. There's no changing him but he needs to respect your opinion and if he can't do that, then I wouldn't be associating with him any longer.
I see it as being akin to the way some people get around vegetarians, or people who don't drink, or atheists, or asexual people, or \[insert long list of other possibilities, including the reverse of all of the above\].

Some people invest huge amounts of time, money and emotional energy into certain ideas or activities. If they meet another person who states that they have no interest in that thing, it feels like a personal attack no matter how polite the other person is.

What you say: I don't want to drive

What they hear: Driving is stupid and bad and therefore you're stupid and bad and all the time and money you've put into your car was a huge waste and you've got no personality so you should go curl up in a ditch and die

This hostile response can trigger over almost anything. If you've ever said something completely innocuous like ""I don't like video games"" or ""I don't like anime"" and had people blow up on you to a ridiculous extent, this is why.
A coworker recently asked me where I park; when I told her I take the bus, she said ""what??"" and looked at me like I said I telecommute with astral projection. The bus is free! I don't even have to walk far enough to make my minimum daily steps! The best part is that she lives a few blocks from work, while I'm on the other side of town. If anything, I'm the one who should be giving her a weird look for driving to work."
Why I chose to get HRT/MHT,177,Menopause,"The joint pain aspect of it all is wild. I didn’t even connect my SI joint pain to peri until after I started HRT and the pain went away on its own.

Damn. You are a FUCKING QUEEN. I can't believe you survived all of that. My problems are miniscule compared to yours but they have felt like they are just piling on year by year since I hit 37. Restless leg syndrome, plantar fascittis, quad tendonitis, patellar pain syndrome, irritability, night sweats, dizziness, brain fog. I have an appointment with Gennev in a few weeks and I am planning to take whatever they give me. I'm so fucking sick of not being able to exercise and feeling like the body I used to be able to rely on has just failed me.
You don’t have to defend your use of
HRT. It’s a shame any woman feels she needs to do that. It’s
Giving early 00s when women were shamed for not giving unmedicated birth in a baby pool in their living rooms. or choosing to have a c section. Our bodies; our choice dammit!!

We can also take HRT for its health benefits or simply because we want to try it out

A tweet with over 143k likes about how men themselves do not care about men's mental health. Thoughts?,147,MensRights,"This is societal issue. How men are conditioned from young age. All this does blames men as always.
If it really mattered there wouldn't be any backlash whenever men try to create movements, institutions or pressure politics into changing these issues
So what should we do just give up ? Cuz all this does is put the blame on men again and makes their problems irrelevant it's kind a gaslighting thing going on to make men feel like they're the problem
Men have tried men’s only spaces and then women complain about it being men only and invade those spaces. Women do not care about men’s mental health and never have
It is likely true because men are often socialized to prioritize the needs of others over their own, leading to a form of internalized self-neglect. However, it's important to recognize that the argument ""they don't care for themselves"" can be applied to various groups facing less favorable circumstances. This lack of empathy for men in disadvantaged situations highlights a strong societal bias against men. For instance, consider breast cancer awareness, where significant resources are allocated to address an issue that disproportionately affects women. If same standards as men applied to women, society would have said, ""oh they just need to check themselves go to hospital, if they are not doing it they dont care themselves"" and leave it there. This disparity shows the need for a more balanced approach to empathy and support across all groups."
"My mother lost custody of myself and my brother, in 1964.

She talks to you like she despises you. And based on the rest of your story, it sounds like she has no love for you. She can only ""love"" herself.

I am so sorry she is the way she is. It has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with her, but you are still paying the price. Sending love and kindness to you.
She’s just a hateful and ugly hearted woman. Just like my mom. 

My mom and your mom sound like they went to the same parenting classes (haha) and the same lying and cheating classes. 

I have no patience for her either. She’s incapable of real love.

I hope you get some peace - I would just block and hope she never reaches out to you again (from a different number.)

"Gillman Springs Road will never be ""safe"". Driving will never be ""safe"".",126,InlandEmpire,"People are selfish and they don’t fear the consequences of driving recklessly. Tailgating, going over the speed limit, passing using the bike lane. 

I’ve lived in multiple parts of SoCal and it’s a problem everywhere, so I’m not so sure if it’s strongly related to poverty and mental health. Irvine has some of the worst drivers you’ll ever see. 

I think it comes down to selfishness, lack of awareness, bad driving habits, no fear of the consequences and the fast paced culture of Southern California. Two ways to counteract would be an investment in public transportation and increase in ticketing for reckless driving. Sadly I don’t think our state has the resources to put either in place.
As a cyclists there are definitely some scary stretches of road out here, but what really makes riding scary isn't the road itself, it's the drivers.  Between the dumb/distracted drivers and the outright hostile drivers (how dare you ride a bike on MY road!), it really makes you choose your route carefully and question if this is even a sport you still want to do. 


The saddest part is a lot of this is all avoidable. If people just paid attention and didn't drive like assholes, things would be a lot safer.
Best thing you wrote was about RESPECT and the lack we have of it. Modes of transportation do not teach respect, parents should. People don't respect authority (teachers, police, parents, elders, others) and therfore learn not to respect speed limits, other drivers, pedestrians, etc.

The false reality thing is one that still confuses me.

NDad used to accuse me constantly of ""living in a fantasy world"" and called me delusional all the time. It was just in response to me calling him and NMom out on their shit. 

As I got older though I realized he literally did live in a fantasy world, where he was something he really wasn't, where the people in the family unit were all characters with scripted roles to play, and he was so detached from it all, that it really was a delusional fantasy world he was spinning. He lied about everything, told stories about us to strangers that weren't even real, and as bizarre as it all was, he seemed to believe himself. 

I just still question myself and feel strange for thinking that, because I was raised being told I was the delusional one.
My ndad has lied about multiple things, and I’ve learned that he truly believed them due to the fantasy world he lives in. You tell him “no I’m not coming” He hears “Yes I’ll be there” And then gets mad when you tell him you said no but he insists you said yes. It’s MADDENING. Thankfully I’ve lived far away from them for a few years, but they’re moving closer (next state over) in a few months. They’ve already invited themselves over for Christmas when we said we’re coming to their house for Thanksgiving and my mother in law’s for Christmas.  Husband is also having issues with his mom, so at this point, we might just disappear for Christmas. It’s gonna be “fun.”
The religious aspect of it really is the super-fuel that makes a bad situation worse. I was raised religious, and would have terrible dreams when I was a kid. I'd wake up in a sweat. I think I was in my early 30s when I finally managed to peel all that off me. That's a trauma all by itself.
Yep. My spawn point is fully delusional. You can't interact with her bc she lives in her own reality in her head. I had to go no contact to save my Self from her delusions."

If someone you know is going through it, DO NOT CALL THE FUCKING COPS.

As someone with MDD (Major depressive disorder aka clinical depression (yes im officially diagnosed)) i HATE this ad with a passion

Its using a mental illness that has plagued multiple lives as something quirky and like it doesnt seem to mention anywhere that like ""hey, this test may not be accurate"" 

If you think you're depressed, ask yourself ""do i wanna kms"" if the answer is yes, you're prob depressed and should see a therapist to get diagnosed

Dont take an online test that's obv trying to leech of your mental disorder for profit (atleast im assuming they're getting money off this)

Theres also other ads from this same test that like says ppl cry blood during the test (?) which uhm obv isnt true, if you're crying blood you that doesnt mean ur depressed but theres def something wrong LMFAOOO

"I don't wish to be sick, I wish to know the name of the sickness I have",92,ChronicPain,"Incredibly frustrating thing to hear. We don't want to be sick, we want to receive appropriate care and in order to do so, we need to discover the actual cause of our symptoms. Until then, the disease is just running rampant and potentially damaging our bodies further.
You are not alone. My test results came back normal and I’m told to just take supplements and quit using cannabis, the only thing I really have for my pain. It feels like a nightmare, it feels like no one on this planet understands, except you guys here of course. It’s so frustrating. I recently quit university because of how bad my health got. I don’t even have the faith that my doctor will sign my medical leave form since they think I’m so young & normal. I don’t even recognize myself anymore, the name chronic pain doesn’t even give justice to how painful this is
Me too. It’s so frustrating not knowing what’s causing the pain and symptoms. I’m praying for all of us who are dealing with pain, anxiety and depression 💙
Don't give up. It took me 11 yrs to get diagnosed and I was diagnosed almost by accident. I've had been in a the hospital for a few days again. Dr came and said... you are just constipated because of the use of morphine. I got so extremely angry. Telling him he could not be more wrong.
I used morphine Because I had extreme abdominal pain, not the other way around.
Then I screamed And IF I was constipated WHAT THE HELL is that pain in my BACK!?
DR looked at me confused. Your Back you say? ME: Does anybody listen at all?? I keep telling you people that it starts in my back and ends in the front. DR: Can you show me? 
Me showing him. He looks at me and said I'll call neurology. Neurology  took 1!!! Look at my symptoms. Looks at me and says 
""I think I know what is wrong"" Total disbelieve on my end. But he was right. Only reason he knew was that his study buddy did research on my condition. That is why he instantly recognised it. 
And I've had so many surgeries tests etc that I started to believe it was in my head and I was thinking to myself I was a munchhauser. But then again I hated going to the Doctors and hospital. I did not need attention, I needed an answer. 
Just keep advocating for yourself. It sucks when they don't take you seriously. 
I've experienced this so many times. They were way more willing to help if my Husband would intervene. Even if I said the exact same thing he did. They rarely listen to a woman I noticed unfortunately.

How poor posture and improper exercise affected my quality of life - thought it was just anxiety and stress,87,Posture,"Thanks for sharing. I think I have many similar issues. How did you and your PT release the knots in your neck?
I have been having similar issues. Funny to stumble upon something so relatable by accident. Please let me know if your symptoms end up getting better with the work you’ve been doing
Massages for releasing something have only short term effects.
This is the biggest problem in PT, sometimes they give only treatments that relief symptoms, but dont change anything longterm.


So be sure to work on the root causes, the dysfunctions, muscles weakness, etc...as you are doing with exercises.




For FORWARD HEAD/CERVICAL ISSUES:
Not just chin tucks, you need cervical extensors strenghtening too.
Mobility (rotations) and rieducation too.
Very important: Middle and Lower trapezius, for example prone T and Y/V raises exercises.




Thoracic rotations and extension mobility should be added if you have kyphotic posture,rounded shoulders and spine/sternum pain.




""Mobility"" is something needed for something specific. Not a thing that a person should do randomly with the mindset of ""more is better"".


If you are sedentary and inactive, you ll have big benefits from pilates etc.


Diaphragm breathing exercises yes.


Excessive stretching...No!
If you stretch and muscle and dont feel anything, stop.
Same as mobility, the more isnt better.
You dont need neither too short neither too long muscles.
This can confuse you, but it s how body works.






If you want you can take cervical and others exercises here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Posture/comments/1ep0a0r/if_your_posture_never_got_better_change_method_an/



At least add cervical extensions.
Suboccipital muscles(what Pt massages you) become chronically tight and overwork because the deep extensors of cervical spine arent working..so you need them, not just chin tucks.
That's pretty relateable. I've had neck pain and spent way too much time on the internet in my younger days practicing terrible posture. Once, for a few days, I felt like I was just constantly wanting to fall backwards and I wasn't sure if there was some major neurological issue or what. I workout these days and work on posture so I'm much better and haven't had that issue since. So as far as dizziness and vertigo go, it could well be due to bad posture.

I have bad anxiety too and when I do my front core tightens which makes me want to slump. The way I've handled it is, even if I'm going to be anxious, I mentally re-route that tension to more relevant muscles needed for posture. I use a stool now so I can't totally relax when sitting anyway which makes me not sit too long, which is again something I need to do.
Seems like my story. And i figured out that it's all related to posture you are on the right path and actually indeed anxiety, brain fog, tiredness it's all related to posture. Ribcage position and hip mobility.... all boils down to Posture. But correcting it is a hell of a lot of work and patience. You need to find kinesiologist or movement patterns expert. Specially trained in Bill Hartmann model.  You can start focusing on videos from greg Chaplin, Zac cupples, Bill Hartmann. It's 100 percent correctable"
Why such visceral reaction whenever this topic is brought up in any situation? Original post wasnt even minimising or speak over women's struggles,84,everydaymisandry,"Except we can't create safe spaces at all. Any time we try to open a refuge for male victims of domestic abuse it gets derailed by misandrists. The therapy fallacy is ridiculous as well, more than half of male suicide victims pursue some form of therapy prior. Evidently the gynocentric approach to therapy isn't working for most men, and that says more about the therapy given than the recipient.
When men try to create community around these issues, we get shouted down and smeared with libels. Remember the Toronto university ""fucking scum"" debacle from a few years back?

Just yesterday I got accused of opposing women's liberation because I participate here, mensrights, and LWMA. They tell you to create community and then get upset when  you do.

Seems like a fine time to remind everyone that creating no win situations (aka damned if you do, damned if you don't) is one of the hallmarks of emotional abuse.
PFPs for both check out. 

Also, the bottom one, wtf is she talking about?
Men *used* to have a great many safe spaces, until women forced the issue with new laws and lawsuits to *invade* men's spaces. And then change them to suit women.

There used to even be a boys-only Boy Scouts! Laws and lawsuits later - no longer boys-only.

Notice how there are NO efforts to force boys onto the *Girl* Scouts? ""Safe spaces"" are only for that privileged class, women, I guess.

I could really use a men's club or men-only gym.

If you're on the fence about making the switch.,81,dumbphones," My dumb phone is coming today and I got it for this exact reason. To use my smart phone as a “super iPod touch” as you said. Except I made sure the phone has hotspot capabilities so I don’t even need to remove my sim. I’ve already had my social media deactivated for around 4 months now

But I still ended up dooming scrolling on apps like YouTube. This should be my final step towards true freedom
This is beautiful. A thoughtful and motivating reflection on your experience. Thank you so much.
Thank a lot for sharing your dumbphone journey ! I enjoyed a lot reading this !

The « if that’s important they’ll text/call » is so real ! I noticed that’s after switching to a dumbphone the only things that need internet on a smartphone phone are not THAT important, i always remind to myself « if social media or any internet based apps are so important then how were we living in the late 2000’s ? we just lived that’s it ! »
During that time i had a a Sony Ericsson W995 that i used only for music on my way to school and to call my parents to reassure them that i arrived at school safely or if i had an emergency.
I took the bus everyday to go to school and for the bus schedule i just used the paper version, it’s as simple as that, and i survived lol.

In 2024, it feels that we need a smartphone for everything since everything get more and more digital but actually there’s no law that force ourself to get a smartphone or a phone at all, how the elderly or some disabled people do then ? Or what if your phone battery dies ? There should always be a non digital version for any task (ex : i hate qr codes menus at restaurants, is that more complicated to print out menus ? As said previously what if your battery dies or your camera is broken, you don’t eat ?).

For my experience after switching to a dumbphone lifestyle i noticed that i accept more to be bored or waiting to get at home at the end of the day to check youtube/reddit or to talk with my friends, waiting for this moment makes you appreciate it more ! It’s as exciting as waiting for a day out with your friends, you notice the precious value of the moments !
You've worded exactly this growing desire I've been having... I resonated with every sentiment of yours, with ""Clockwork Oranging myself"" and ""being force-fed the seven deadly sins"" hitting close to home, because that's exactly what I feel has worsened my experience of technology, not to speak of my overall cognitive performance (which should be alarming in and of itself!). Being born in 2001 I'm lucky enough to remember a very few years before algorithmically tailored, short-form content where using devices was exciting, as you said preparing media for yourself to enjoy in doses in the upcoming days rather than shoving down anything, instantly, shocking the brain over and over again to squeeze out some cheap pleasure. Reading this post has reminded me of all this. I'm determined to strip my cellphone of all the ""cheap pleasures"", I'm curious and excited to see how it will go :)
Thanks OP, your post resonates so much with me. I've only just started looking at this sub and I'm keen yet hesitant to make the switch. Crazy how much I view my smartphone as something of a lifeline, which on reflection is perhaps a good enough reason itself to make the switch!  
My anxious brain keeps going ""yeah but what if x, y, or z happens and you're stuck somewhere without a smartphone!?"" as if I've had one my whole life and cannot breathe without one. It's crazy how much it has a hold on me. Which is how it feels. It has started to feel suffocating, or maybe just too much like a comforter.

I was relative latecomer to smartphones and have only had one for about 10 years, but in that time my concentration span has steadily gotten worse, my sleep has gotten worse, I haven't read as many books as in the 10 years before that, etc. I am in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD (actually more ADD) and I think the smartphone just doesn't fit at all well with such neurodiversity conditions. The usage patterns, distraction and dopamine disruption, etc.  
I have come to realise that I'm addicted to my smartphone, to doomscrolling, to online shopping, to social media to some extent (I use WhatsApp and Facebook but can and do avoid them at times), er... Reddit!  
I have tried limiting it's use recently - leaving it at home a couple of times when going out for a walk, not leaving it on my bed side table at night so that I don't look at it during the night (which is perhaps the habit I loathe the most right now), etc, but these haven't stuck, as, well, like I said I'm addicted and it's not easy to give up or control because that's the nature of addiction. So I think I need to cut the cord as keeping the smartphone to use with wifi just means that I'll continue to do that all the time and just use the dumb phone for making calls and texting, and I'll end up walking around with and managing two phones which is more even more ridiculous than the situation I'm in now!

Anyway not sure why I'm putting this here. Felt appropriate rather than making my own post. I guess I just cannot fathom how one has the discipline to keep their smartphone but not continue to use it 24/7 whether it has a SIM card in or not. The lack of a simcard would only slightly curb my use and to be honest after some time - maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks, maybe longer (although likely not) - I would miss it (i.e. the dopamine cycle) so much and rationalise any excuse (which is how addiction works) to simply put the sim back in the smartphone and guiltily ditch the dumbphone. Hmm, don't think this is going to be easy for me!

Thanks again for sharing though OP!"

Thanks for stopping by today :) What do you think about today's games?

I attended Gamescom last week, but very few interesting mobile games were shown off - unfortunately. I'll write a blog post about it on MiniReview the week after next week. Next week, I've got my last week of summer vacation.

And as always, here are some new games I think look interesting that I haven't had the time to try yet:

Ive been checking your yt every week. Glad you see you post here. Will you have a video out soon?"
An underrated breed of Republican: The Stassen Republican.,69,thecampaigntrail,"I think you're just describing Upper Midwest liberal Republicans?
I'm gonna be honest, I don't think it's gonna be Stassen again.
imma be real with you, i fucking LOVE harold stassen
I’d say this is Tom’s alt, but you’re too socially liberal for that.

Can anyone advise on an extremely vulnerable adult who is homeless in Manchester?,67,manchester,"Hi! It looks like this post is about homelessness in Manchester. Please focus your energies into helping solve the problem, and keep the discussion productive. Remember to have some consideration for those less fortunate than you.

If you would like to donate to or support homelessness charities, please check out our dedicated wiki page [**here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/manchester/wiki/homelessness)

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/manchester) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Contact the Manchester council rough sleepers team on outreach-inreach@manchester.gov.uk
Recommend they get themselves down to the [Booth Centre](https://www.boothcentre.org.uk/) near Strange ways, can get a warm meal and be  plugged into services and with any luck register them with a GP so they can ensure they continue to get their meds. There will be info for other services there too. Declare homeless at the town hall as well if not already. Being known in the system is important, especially in the winter as when it drops below freezing they will be put up in hotel for the night.
I know it’s a long shot, but there are food vans for the homeless each night in town, if you’ve got a picture of him, it might be worth showing it to the people there. I wish you the best of luck 🤞
In my experience it is still the responsibility of his usual social care team to ensure his safety. I know he is now in a different LA but that isn’t where he lives. His home and usual services are wherever he usually resides. They have in depth knowledge of him and know that he is vulnerable and doesn’t have capacity to make these decisions. Therefore a DOLS should be initiated here to return him to his usual address and to keep him there. This is in his best interests. A person who lacks capacity to make a decision can have a DOLS put in place where a decision is then made for him in his best interests. A meeting should be being arranged between his usual professions called a best Interest meeting. 
The police may have decided he has capacity but their assessment skills are so limited and they don’t know anything about him. A social worker who knows will do a far more in depth and accurate assessment. 
Push the local social worker. It is absolutely their responsibility here!"
We're forgetting a vital detail: Andrew was just 14.,69,AndrewGosden,"I think people underestimate his intelligence whilst overestimating his level of social awareness and independence. I was friends with someone like him through secondary school before I moved for A-Levels and at 14 he was sitting the local maths and spelling bee olympiads and held gold prizes in regional maths competitions. I always felt that whilst he was academically smart he was remarkably naive and poorly socialised owing to his preference to spend most of his time at home or in school clubs. 

With this in mind even though grooming is a likely theory, it's equally as likely that he was simply a naive young boy who met an unlucky and unfortunate end. 

***as always: if you have a tip, please submit it--no matter how small***
Very valid points, I'm now leaning towards it being an impulsive decision on the day to just see where the day took him
100% I was a moron at 14. Tho being a girl
I maybe was slightly more wary of certain situations.
I don't think you can so easily generalise about 14 year olds. In many ways I was more cautious as a kid than I am now, as I've had life experience to know it'll probably be okay and ah well if it isn't. I was a real worrier when I was 14.

My point is that the stereotype about kids being impulsive and lacking caution isn't always true. Andrew going to London was impulsive, I'll grant that, but it doesn't mean he had no caution at all.

Also, the idea we've missed something in not considering his age is quite strange to me as that's been a large part of the concern from day one.
Thinking back to when I was 14 years old.. I fell out with my mum one morning, showed up at school with £50 and a change of clothes (won’t get you far lol). I had no idea how to buy a train ticket asked the teacher how because I was going to go stay with my sister until things cooled down. Andrew knew how to buy a ticket so I believe yes he could have done something impulsive."
Have you ever really thought much about the impact of lead exposure on GenX?,67,GenXWomen,"Well that’s a huge bummer. And now we have microplastics too! 

But at least there is one good thing. The rich got richer!
Great news for me is my family owned a gas station when my Mom was pregnant with me, and she was there every day listening to the Watergate trial and working on the books. Extra exposure. Fabulous!
Not just lead from gas. Lead paint, lead pencils, lead drinking glasses, lead crystal glasses. My house was full of it growing up. I not only have lead in my body but mercury (my grandmother had mercury in a dropper in her medicine cabinet). We are all full of chemicals and toxins and don’t forget the food that was mass produced like cereal and other shelf stable food. I would say my generation GenX has been exposed the most since being born.
I used to play with mercury. My grandpa had a little baby food jar of it. It was fun to play with. I still have mercury fillings, too
The only “conspiracy theory” I have subscribed to in my whole life is that the rise of Trump and Trump-ism is due to lead exposure."
Cry about it. Also why Antia Sarkeesian???,67,saltierthankrayt,"There are many things to criticize Anita for even through a feminist perspective (personally i think her videos on Bayoneta and Hitman in particular are very flawed and can be easily picked apart by even the most basic of scrutiny) but what in the blue hell does she have to do with the tweet in the thumbnail? I can't believe that it's been fucking 10 years since the first Feminist Frequency episode and Anita's face still works as instant clickbait
Hasn't it been forever since the time she was actually relevant?
Anita Sarkeesian isn't even relevant today whatsoever. Why is she here?
Because to chuds, Anita Sarkeesian is seen as the arbiter of the apocalypse that single-handedly ushered in the rotten state of the modern gaming industry rather than a well-meaning creator of a mediocre series.
Why are these people so stuck in the past?

Gamergate happened a decade ago, get over it."

I wholeheartedly believe that Harkimos asking to have some bugs because while all the veggies and fruits are nice I'd like some protein would absolutely blow they'r minds."
If you need to talk to someone,62,GeneralMotors,"I have been down before but never used employee assitantance programs. Are they actually helpful?

Let's say I call and say I'm depressed about job loss, or because my boss is causing me stress..what do they do?

Curious for real life reviews.
I used EAP for something else. It was useful and it helped to talk to someone objectively. 

When I got laid off several years ago one of the church groups helping with job search techniques had counseling sessions and it was very helpful. It was supposed to be a drop in group session for anyone who had lost a job but I was the only one who showed up each week so it was very one on one and specific to my situation. I was dealing with contractor jobs ending abruptly due to changes in the business needs as well as long distance eldercare.  

Talking things out with someone who is objective can be very helpful.
It's ok to be not ok
Since you only get 3 visits through it I’m pretty sure it’s just a legal CYA by GM for if/ when an employees commits suicide. They can claim they offered support regardless of whether they were a contributor to the persons mental state. 

That was true for the other company I worked for that had “free” emergency mental health services like this and GM hasn’t done anything to make me think they are different or more concerned for our wellbeing.
I have found it incredibly helpful and used it consistently throughout my employment as a short-term counseling avenue. What you talk about with the licensed counselors is strictly confidential. My understanding and experience are below: 

It is short-term counseling (usually up to 5 hour-long sessions after the intake session). When you call, after some logistical questions and verification, a licensed counselor will answer the phone and does an intake session with you to understand what brings you to counseling (generally 30min-1hr). After the intake session, they let you know if they recommend the further counseling sessions for you to work through the issue. (I haven't had them not offer the additional counseling sessions). They can be telephone sessions, video sessions, sometime in-person sessions. Telephone sessions they can generally schedule you pretty quick for the sessions, generally less quick for the video and generally much less quick for the in-person. If after the sessions you want to continue, they're happy to work with you to keep that counselor or find additional counseling, it just wouldn't be covered through the EAP."
Psych patients and countertransference,63,ausjdocs,"My dear mentor, who was an ICU Consultant, would often tell me: ""There's already a long line of people waiting to call this person an asshole. Don't get in that line. Get in the other line, much shorter, of people who have a professional obligation to look after them.""

I deal with my feelings by acknowledging them and setting them aside; it's only relevant to their care insofar as it's a significant source of bias. Plenty of coronial inquests are about unsavoury people who, no matter their unsavouriness, didn't deserve to die.

You used a great word, countertransference, and perhaps this is a good time to reflect on why their behaviour provokes such strong feelings in you. How would your parents have delt with you if you behaved like this?
Psych Reg here to add my two cents.


The most important and difficult thing about counter-transference is recognizing that you're experiencing it. So kudos on you for reflecting on that!


It's important to recognize counter-transference, firstly because it is associated with burnout and therefore it is important to recognize and manage it before it leads to your work being affected. A debrief with a trusted colleague or even a non-work friend (can be a very casual debrief) can go a long way in dealing with counter transference and avoiding it's negative impact. One trick that my supervisor taught me was doing a mindless or a mundane task after a particularly difficult work day can help reset some of the countertransfer (I do this by either putting on a sitcom that I enjoy and have watched many times before or scrolling on my phone).


Secondly, it's important to recognize counter-transference because you're not obligated to like everyone you treat but you are obligated to treat everyone to the best of your abilities and negative counter-transference can lead to sub-consciously providing sub-standard care to that pt. So it is important to recognize that you're experiencing negative countertransfer from a pt and making sure you're still treating them the same way you would treat any other pt.


Lastly, knowing the underlying cause of the pts' behavior can go a long way in developing empathy towards them and managing countertransfer. The example you gave of the pt who takes no responsibility and puts everything on others. That is very commonly seen in pts with cluster B traits and it's called having an ""external locus of control."" It can stem from having horrible things done to you in the past and your agency being taken away that you start viewing the world as having no control in it. It can also be a maladaptive coping/defense mechanism - your life is so miserable that it is easier and more comforting to blame everyone else for it than to consider that you might have contributed to it yourself or take responsibility that you have a role to play to fix it (which is a lot more daunting thing to confront).
Psych Reg here - it is complicated and you have to look beyond the behaviour.

countertransference/transference and projection identification is a very powerful defence mechanism and way of seeking help/getting needs met/pulling people close/attachment seeking behaviour. 

  
projection identification involves projecting for example their own hatred of self onto the doctor. The doctor then internalises this and projects it back onto the patient. Ultimately fulfilling the patients belief they are a bad person. 

This behaviour is unconsciously driven.

You have to consider the vulnerability of this person. And the psychological regression that is entailed in a hospital admission. Behaviour regression, acting out, escalating behaviour to elicit responses. 

Some people have a background where the only time they were ""held"" by their parents was in restraint. So using aggression is a way to draw near. 

You also have to consider re-enactments which are occurring between the patient and yourself.  for example Re-enacting relationships with care-givers (or lack there of) 

You also have to consider the power dynamics at play - Mental health act, involuntary treatment. Persons who have a background of trauma are very vulnerable to power dynamics.

What Im saying is you have to display empathy and reflect on how this person makes you feel. If you feel irritated i bet they feel irritated. IF you hate them I bet they hate themselves.
I find kicking them out cathartic to be honest. 

Being a psych reg is a lot like being a car salesman. You can find enjoyment in being able to convince these people to follow the plan you have outlined. 

The PC answer is that these people often have went through significant trauma and a lot of the things they say are clues to pathology underneath. It’s more enjoyable when you see them as a puzzle to understand rather than someone being a dick
The points being made by other commenters are absolutely valid: these are symptoms of underlying disorders/unmet needs etc so there is still work to be done on some level.

However, if you're dealing with an asshole, you can provide all the empathy in the world. You can sympathise with every trauma and disadvantage that life has thrown their way. You can be fully understanding of how they ended up being an asshole.

But they're still an asshole.

If you don't acknowledge that, and acknowledge the response it generates in you and the toll it takes just interacting with some patients, you will end up accruing a whole heap of negative emotions that you won't process until it is too late and you, too, hath become yonder asshole.

Do your best. Sometimes, you'll get to see that crystallizing moment where someone actually internalises a change, but you'll miss that opportunity if you're burning all your empathy on every single person that comes through the door.

Look after yourself, and look after your team. If you feel this way, the nurses and fresher doctors might be copping it more consistently but trying to appear professional by suppressing all of this until they pop. Coffees, donuts and debriefs (even if it's just a quick ""Christ, how frustrating was that guy yesterday!?"") go a long way to making people feel okay about being meat for the healthcare machine."
"Cut off “Friend Group”, along with MOH title. ",60,weddingdrama,"Hugs friend. It sounds like you have a lot going right now. Don’t waste any more energy on people who aren’t a net positive to your life.
Hey there.  You're having Quite A Time, aren't you?  My mom was an alcoholic too.  It was hard for me to learn that she was an adult and in control of her own life and if she knew her lungs were going bad but still smoked, they were her lungs and it was her life.  I eventually learned that she was the only one who could change her behavior.  I'm not going to suggest meetings to you; you don't need more things to do, but you might want to start reading the Adult Children of Alcoholics website.  Don't expect magic from reading it; the tough times you had growing up had a cumulative effect on you, and I discovered that it's work to get rid of the cumulative effects.  But on bad days you can read a few things and they might give you a new perspective.

Your friends don't deserve you now, and sure didn't deserve you in the past, either.  What a bunch of jerks.  You're much better than them and have far more manners to boot.  You're way too busy for their shenanigans.  I have a relative who acts like your friends; it took me a long time to come to grips with the realization that she's changed too much to be my friend anymore.  She's mean, she carries grudges other people don't even know she has, and she badmouths people all the time.  If she's mad, she'll say nasty things about you for days to everyone who crosses her path, and if she later finds out she was wrong, she doesn't bother correcting what she said so that everyone else still thinks you did the horrible thing she imagined.

Hugs to you.  You're going to move forward and do well, because you have a good attitude and are kind.  Never doubt your ability to do well.  If you get a chance, report back and let everyone know how well you're doing!
It sounds like you are cleaning garbage from your house and restarting your life!!!

I cut my mom off and wish I’d done it 25 yrs earlier.
I gotta say, I only read your first post just now, but these ladies don’t sound like they are your friends. I’m sure YOU were a friend to them, but they appear to either be classist mean girls or be totally comfortable having their lives run by a classist mean girl. 

I can’t make this not hurt, but I can promise you that if you keep working on and investing in -yourself- like you have been, you will meet much, much better friends in the future.
These people are what my mom called fair weather friends. Only come around when things are good, and nowhere to be found when you need them. It won't be long before you'll be grateful you're not a part of that group of harpies anymore."
My AI companion system,56,artificial,"Amazing. I see a lot of promise in AI helping with mental health. Your setup sounds cool.
Your story is a heavy hearted one, and appreciate the depth of your sharing here. I'm totally impressed by your willingness to fight and work at making a life that works for you. Few even try. 
I'm somewhat in a similar situation and am curious what the back end of all this might look like, software wise. Is all this in containers in proxmox? 
I have so many questions, and wondered if you would be willing to share further so others could maybe try to get something like this running too. Again thanks for the inspiration.
Genuinely wish I could hang out with someone like you
This is fascinating, thanks so much for sharing!

>Memory is handled by Vector database, weighted graphs and pure text files, allowing the AI to grow a database of knowledge of myself, past conversations and likes, dislikes and mental health.

I'd love to know more about how this sort of thing works.  I know how an LLM can use a vector DB, but what kinds of use cases does your system do with it?  Do you have some sort of prompt template or standard prompts that tell it to always consider certain kinds of memories for certain kinds of prompts?

Edit: and does the system write to these places and if so how and when?
It’s amazing how you've turned technology into such a supportive part of your life. I love how each AI has its own personality and role—really shows the thought and care you’ve put into this. It’s cool to see how it’s all coming together for you. Thanks for sharing your story, it's really inspiring!"
"I have someone who knows I have cptsd, and they constantly bombard me with bad advice, cloying questions about my trauma, and trigger me. How do I make them stop.",47,CPTSD,"You need to set clear boundaries. Tell them ""Hey, I know you're just curious but I really am not comfortable with these kinds of questions. They make me feel (overwhelmed/angry/etc). The next time you bring this up I will have to (end our conversation/hang up/change the subject/leave the room, etc.)"" And then when they do it again, firmly remind them they crossed a boundary and follow through. If they keep doing it, communicate to them that your friendship may not being able to continue. 

If they care about you and are a healthy relationship to have, they should at the very least try to respect your boundaries. Having mental illness themselves is not an excuse. If you are clearly communicating to them that ""This thing you are doing hurts me"" and they ignore it and keep hurting you, its not a good friendship to have, imo. But if you want to try to salvage the relationship, you first have to assume ignorance and be SUPER clear and serious that these questions are not okay and you need to protect yourself.
What you’re feeling is entirely normal and appropriate for the situation. If someone does not respond to repeated request and statements about their behavior than they are in capable of addressing the issue at some level and it’s up to you to decide if you’re going to continue to tolerate that or separate yourself. One of the problems with CPTSD is a lot of the times we don’t have very good understanding of our boundaries or respect for them. You’re frustrated because you’re not respecting your boundary and allowing this to continue you need to shut off the conversation and walk away, and if that doesn’t get taken because this person doesn’t get it or doesn’t choose to get it and for that I feel for you and you have my empathy
Set a boundary with them. ""That's something I don't talk about."" Or ""That's something I don't want to hear about."" 

Full stop. Change of subject. If they persist, walk away. And if they don't stop, cut them out of your life. 

You're in charge and setting your boundaries is a healthy thing to do!
Boundaries and consequences. Be clear, concise, and leave no room for misunderstanding.

You could tell them that you will not answer those questions anymore, and if they continue to ask, tell them what will happen. It might be that you ignore them, it might be that you leave the room, whatever it is I recommend a passive approach that just disengages from the conversation. Anything that engages them actively could be read as you encouraging/enabling them, even though that's the last thing you want.

A lot of people who are invasive, enmeshed, or resistant to boundaries will complain that a boundary is an attempt to control them. So, just in case they bring up that argument, remind them that you are not controlling them. They can do what they want. And you can do what you want, such as immediately leaving the conversation. You are controlling *your* behavior.

Finally, a boundary is not a punishment. It's something you do for yourself to move through life more easily. You deserve that, and it's not inconveniencing anyone else. It can be hard and uncomfortable to establish a new boundary, especially if you've known someone for a long time. But sometimes that also works in our favor — if they think they know us well, showing our assertive side can catch them off guard and inspire them to take us more seriously.

It all depends so much on the person, but I hope some of this helps!
Tell them to stop asking questions like that.
""Trauma is uncomfortable and unless I bring it up or it's relevant to some discussion we're already having please don't bring it up. It's triggering.""

Just say it. Flatly. No anger or upset. 

Set clear boundaries and then watch. If they don't respect your boundaries you need to cut them out. No matter how old or clueless they are."

Strong week! 

I’m really enjoying Dome…I mean Ocean Keeper! Takes a while to get enough upgrades to get going but it’s a solid premium title. I’d recommend a controller. 

I’ve been eyeballing Overlive for a while now. I appreciate the nudge AlexSem!
Man, you’re doing gods work! Thanks a lot for all your reviews  🙏
Thank you, mate :) I'm glad this week could be extra strong now that I won't be here next week, hehe. I will be back the week after next week as always, though.

Nice, I did enjoy Ocean Keeper too. I hope the dev will keep working on it to improve on some of its weaker sides. But I'm just happy to see another premium title in the genre.

Uh, and I hope you'll enjoy Overlive if you check it out. I've PM'ed AlexSem a screenshot of your comment, hehe.
And thank YOU for all the support of these posts and MiniReview. It means everything to me! <3 I'll keep creating as long as you guys keep enjoying the content.

It's okay to feel the way you feel. We've all been there (at least those who grew up with the lie). Hang in there.
My niece is from an egg donor. My SIL had damage to both of her tubes and could not conceive naturally. They also did not have enough money to be able to afford IVF. By the time they had money from my mother’s estate my SIL was 46. Her eggs were too old. I often wonder how I will be able to comfort her when she is given this news. She is 2 and the light of our lives. What you are feeling is very normal. You just had your whole world turned upside down. The only way through this is to go through it unfortunately. What you are feeling is definitely expected. Give yourself some time to feel how you feel. Thankfully you have this sub for a place to vent those feelings.

Sort of a PSA for those travelling for Red Rocks,42,glassanimals,"the airport (and honestly most places around denver but if you can't find some go to an outdoors store) sells boost oxygen and i 100% suggest having one on you while going to red rocks itself even if you feel fine in the city. the city to red rocks is also a massive difference. I felt fine in the city but red rocks winded me.
Thank you for this! I stayed a day before the concert and both the headache when you had while you adjust is no joke. Definitely lots of water
Thank you for this PSA! Never been, but I’ve fantasized about jumping on a plane and going for this venue 😅 I think I might stop fantasizing now lmao

My POTS and asthma already give me a hard enough time on my own lowly (pun intended) little eastern seaboard! I can’t imagine what that first trip for you was like 😭

Take care of yourself y’all!
Stay hydrated and avoid alcohol if you're not used to the altitude. Less oxygen will have you mad effed up fast.
just a heads up cans including ones with oxygen are not permitted into the venue. best to stay hydrated and take it easy if you're not acclimated"
"Grew up poor, just graduated with masters — no financial know-how. Any guidance for repayment plan? Owe 200k",40,StudentLoans,"Goodness gracious. Uh. You need to find government work and just play the long game and minimize your monthly payments and hope for forgiveness at 20 (edit: 10) yrs of consistent payments. Unless you can find a way to increase your income substantially or find growth a couple years in.
If you can work 30+ hours a week, you can try to see if you qualify for PSLF if you work in the public/non-profit sector

The income-based plans and PSLF were made for folks like us. I'm a clinical social worker, and I understand the major burden it feels to have an outstanding amount. 

The income-based plans helped me a lot to not feel like I was living paycheck to paycheck
To take a step back, in terms of strategy the goal is to minimize the amount you pay out of pocket to fulfill your loan obligation. How exactly you go about that really depends on your income and loan debt situation. Which option is cheapest for you overall can require scratch paper and time to figure out, since you sorta have to project out scenarios over a 10-25 year timeline and make some assumptions

For federal loans in your own name, you kinda have to decide between 1) aggressive repayment, 2) waiting out IDR plan forgiveness, or 3) pursuing a forgiveness program like PSLF or similar.

If you owe $200k and you make $30k? You want an IDR plan and to look into PSLF-qualifying employment options. As per https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-court-actions you can apply for an IDR plan with the paper/PDF app but it won't be processed for awhile due to the litigation blocking SAVE. That said, you can apply and then request a forbearance

Past that? I highly recommend people check out the r/personalfinance money management advice in their [prime directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) wiki (which also has a [flow chart version](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png)) since it makes good financial management incredibly straightforward.
Wow. This is a doozy. 

PSLF, as others mentioned is your best bet. 

Good luck!
PSLF pretty sure you have to work at least 30hrs a week"

I'm not sure how close you are to your family, but I would set boundaries and stick to them. 
""I appreciate you don't understand the importance of X, but I need you to respect it. If you put do Y, we will leave. It won't be designed to offend you, but to protect him."" 
If the clothes are put on the floor / he is made to sit on the sofa / the chairs are moved... You leave. No discussion beyond ""I'm sorry but we have to leave now because this place doesn't feel safe for him any more. We still love you and this isn't us being rude, just protecting his mental health. We will see you again at X time."" If it continues, then you may have to consider lowering contact but I feel that they will get the message quickly!
It’s amazing/depressing how you were able to train the dog to respect his boundaries but not his family.
Since everyone has said the other stuff.....""his aunt has taken his clean clothes, placed them on the floor where the dogs roam, and then allowed the dogs to sit on them after they’ve been washed.""

WHO DOES THIS!?!? If you place clean clothes on the floor and let your dirty dogs on them then they stopped being ""clean clothes"" XD.  Like holy hell I don't have OCD and that would make me so mad (if it's her clothes then that's gross but who cares in the long run but that's really rude and awful if it's someone else's clothes)!
 Congratulations on your marriage! It's important to prioritize mental health."
Needing advice on unconventional WFH situation,36,workfromhome,"Take on some big home improvement projects 

Gardening even if in containers 

Take up something like sewing, crochet, whatever
 
Join a few book clubs so you'll have lots of reading to do and some interaction when you attend clubs to discuss them (which by the way I do at noon via zoom) 

Get a pet. 

If you can, take your laptop and go work from a library. Plenty to read there, plenty of people to watch, and a change of scenery if only for a half day 

I think you have to think of it almost like talking to an elderly recently retired relative who just doesn't know what to do with their time, but doesn't have transportation to leave the home. What would you suggest to them? Try and enact some of those things for yourself. 

Not easy. Hang in there.
Not sure if someone mentioned this but if you MUST answer from your laptop, then my answer is simple: tether your laptop wifi from your cell phone so you can bring your laptop basically anywhere you'd like. Put the same email app on your phone  so you get notified when an email comes in...then make yoir way to the laptop!

I've been working from home for 9 years but I am flooded with work and use multiple screens for my job. You have a perfect scenario to work literally anywhere you want! I'd plan a trip to the beach or river or really anywhere you're cell phone has service. I find that just having a change of scenery will boost your energy or at least make you feel less depressed.

Buy a little foldable table, hit the beach and answer emails from the sand. Go to the mall and just people watch. You don't know it yet but you have the best work setup most dream of.
Get into reading

Do a home workout routine

Take some classes

Learn a new language

I had a job like this a little bit but it was in person. I wrote a romance novel at my desk!
Wow I’m so jealous. I’m constantly working the minute I wake up until my miserable day ends (usually 9 hours!). 

You could do so many things from home, but I’m also an introvert and love it. 

- Do you write? Start a blog. 
- Are you creative? Etsy store. 
- Fitness nut? Get a bike or walking pad. 
- Just kinda lazy? Watch Netflix on another monitor. 
- Like food? Get into baking!
- Feeling crazy? A puppy
take online free classes through HarvardX or MIT. I think Columbia also has some free online stuff! Another suggestion would be to learn to paint or draw through YouTube tutorials. Create a little schedule for yourself and maybe you'll find some new passions"

"If you can, GO TO THIS VA BENEFITS LIVE EVENT SEP12-14!",34,VeteransBenefits,"Wow. Do other regional offices do these type of events? Like in TX?
I can 100% agree that if there is any chance you can attend I highly recommend it. I went to the same event wanting to get an update on 2 pending claims. The first claim seemed to be a no brainer, the C&P exam was completed, it seemed like all the docs were there so I thought maybe I could get it rated on the spot. The second claim was for PTSD. I've been waiting on a C&P exam and my goal for that claim was to get an exam scheduled. When I sat down with a rater we talked about the reason for my visit and we started with the PTSD claim.

Side note: Prior to this event I had a C&P exam for insomnia secondary to GERD. Ultimately the examiner opined the insomnia was not connected to GERD but based on the hour and a half exam the examiner determined my PTSD and other MH conditions were caused while in service. So with that information I submitted a secondary claim for PTSD. 

So, during the conversation with the rater I told him I had an exam for insomnia and the DBQ should be listed. The rater found the DBQ, read through it and said, ""@#%@%, I can't understand why someone didn't pick this up. I can get this knocked out in about 30 minutes."" I was, ""let's do this."" At that point I thought the rater was going to walk me out and work on it a little later but instead the rater took care of everything as I watched. When he finished, he got in a chat with another team who does the QC & approvals and told them he was sending my claim over. The rater got a response from the other team saying I was next. I was impressed. Not wanting to push my luck, I had to ask about the first claim. The rater told me since it was a PACT Act claim it need a deeper look. I accepted that answer and thanked the rater for all of his help. 

As I drove home I kind of expected it would take VA a week or so to get everything wrapped up and determine my rating. It was an hour drive from the event to the house. When I got home I checked my overall rating just for shits & grins, I was floored. I went from 90% (86% in total) to 100% (96%). It turns out I was rated 70% for PTSD. Needless to say, I was speechless. I was amazed for the small investment of 5 hours, (driving to and from the event, wait time & discussion with the rater) I managed to get my rating over the top. But it doesn't stop there, about a week later I received the decision letter and was surprised I ended up at 100% P&T.

I highly recommend if at all possible, try and go to this event next week. I can't say you'll end up with same rating but at least you'll be able see how sausage is made. It could be well worth your time. Good luck.
Thanks for that. 

Will make an effort to attend.

"To everyone going on 30/31 and has bought tickets from viagogo, stubhub et al - read this!",30,adele,"Point n.4 happened to me. Nowhere in the emails it told me that the link would expire at a certain point. Spent 1 hour with the viagogo Customer Care standing in front of the venue - they offered an alternative ticket, but they were already sold out. This would have been the only concert I went in the last 10 years, but couldn’t.
1. At one point, it was stated that screenshots are explicitly encouraged. This was pointed out to me by another user, and I then read it in official communication. 
2. Once you accept transferred tickets, they cannot be taken back by the seller. 
3. I’ve never had issues with fake tickets from Stubhub or viagogo. Their customer service and guarantee are quite strong. 
4. The *only* issue I’ve had is purchasing too late, and the seller was unable to transfer. I was able to directly contact the seller, they sent me screenshots of the tickets, and a photo of their ID, and I had zero issues. Obviously, if you purchase too late and the transfer isn’t completed in time, you may not be so lucky.
Got a ticket at viagogo for 170 EUR. Ticket was worth 399. All worked out fine and I had an amazing night :) 
Four other people had the same experience with viagogo.
Glad, you are pointing this out and hoping, lots of people concerned see this. Buy your tickets from ticketmaster or eventim, associated with ticketmaster.

Last week, I was very close to buying a ticket on stubhub (row C, just 120 Euros) but then remembered it was just too good to be true. - Then I read the reviews. Frightening!

I ended up with a ticket twice the price from ticketmaster but legit.
The issue is that I wanted to sell mine through Ticketmaster.de but they weren’t allowing ticket resales until less than a week before the show. I wasn’t willing to take the chance, so I sold through viagogo. I made sure that the buyers accepted the tickets into their account so they could be properly used. I just wish the promoter would have allowed resales a long time ago. I guess they didn’t sell out and didn’t want to have to compete with the resale tickets."

This is interesting! I know correlation doesn’t equal causation, but I was on accutane in my late teens and started exhibiting AS symptoms at 21 before eventually getting a formal diagnosis
this is SUPER interesting to me


Grant Genereux has a theory that hypervitaminosis A (in liver stores) is the driver of many autoimmune issues. 


hes written two ebooks on it


https://ggenereux.blog/my-ebooks/
This basically happened to me. I took low dose Accutane for 1 year. I started getting really bad left SI joint pain within a couple months. Sharp pains, trouble walking, joint locking, etc. My derm said it was normal and kept me going with some short breaks and dosage changes to keep the pain low, but it kept creeping back up.

A few months after my last dose my pain started getting worse and was affecting my ability to function. I knew this wasn't normal. Accutane joint pain typically resolves after stopping the meds which is why I never worried while I was taking it.

X-Ray showed lots of issues on both SI joints and pointed to Osteoarthritis. I pushed to see a rheumatologist and he suspected it could be Axial Spondylitis, though my blood work was clear and nothing on the X-Ray suggested it. I just finally had an MRI a few days ago and it came back clear, no inflammation or anything else. I stopped Accutane over a year ago now, so I wonder if something would have shown up on an MRI if I had one back then. I feel like I had sacroilitis and it caused mechanical damage, which I'm now left with.

I haven't followed up with the rheumatologist yet, but it looks like he'll clear me and my diagnosis will just be Osteoarthritis. Kind of crazy because it came on very fast and I know it's from the Accutane.

I've been following this subreddit for some time, and I really relate to a lot of the issues people here have, even though it's not my official diagnosis.

"I hated politics on twitter, so I removed it using AI to better my mental health",30,simpleliving,"I'm surprised by some comments. OP analyses that something is affecting the simplicity of their life and correct it to feel better in their life, takes time to share it with us. And yet I see mean comments almost suggesting OP could be part of the problem (leopard etc.) ? See, this urge to accuse people of something, this phrasing, is exactly the kind of behavior people like OP (and myself) are sick to read on social medias. 4 years on this subreddit and never saw commente like that. Please be better.

Also, in all this media consumption, it is recommended by mental health professionals to do exactly that : filtering what you see. There was always tragic news, events, deaths. The technology today just make it noisier. Lowering the volume does't make you stupid, or an accomplice. You can be conscious that there is a political conflict without eating every news about it. And even if people want to be blind to this, well let them live their life simply.

Also, there is a différence between getting content with intent, and passively getting it : I use twitter to follow news about my hobbies, share my work, and follow my industry. I don't want to see a video of hostages executed, I don't want to know who got killed, injured, insulted, etc. while I'm just scrolling. 

tl;dr: kindly let people share their simple life tricks without judging them, and be better.

The only thing that puts me off doing nights is the fact that it doesn’t seem particularly compatible with family life.

She isn't going to change.  Have you tried therapy to overcome your anxiety? Maybe eventually you can hold a WFH job or one where you interact with people minimally.
Have you talked to his parents about her?
Dealing with nasty in-laws is difficult. I am so sorry you’re having to deal with this. As other commenters say, this behavior will probably not go away. Unfortunately, you and your boyfriend need to sit down and talk about possible boundaries. As long as you and your bf are on the same page, you will be ok. From personal experience, getting parents involved in adult sibling drama is a recipe for disappointment. If you see them actively enabling her behavior, don’t be surprised if they defend her behavior to you and your bf. It’s sad, and it sucks. I know anxiety can really deter you from getting a job, but for your own mental health and the health of your relationship with your bf, I would recommend finding a way to cope with your anxiety.

I didn’t completely hate this book but it didn’t live up to the hype for me, although I did really enjoy Just for the Summer. 

I did have to LOL at the mention of her Nadia’s Cupcakes plugs that are present in all her books I’ve read because as somebody who lives in one of the towns that has her bakery, it’s not really that good IMO and nobody around here really talks about going there 🫣
I really enjoyed Yours Truly. It’s not as surprisingly deep as Helen Hoang’s romances feel to me, but I still liked it a lot. 

Jacob’s internal monologue about his anxiety was written in a way that felt so much like my own that I am literally asking my husband to read it to get a glimpse inside my head. Mine presents a bit differently to the world, but his thoughts/rational felt so familiar. 

I’ve also been through a miscarriage and I know first hand how it can screw you up and mess with your perception of others. Learning that Brianna went through that without the support of her then husband made me forgive some of her communication issues. I could not imagine going through that without the love and support of my husband. I think that explained at least some of her trust issues. 

I wonder if the reason some on this thread have been defensive about it might be that they saw themselves in the parts of the book that you saw as “cartoonish”. As someone who constantly struggles with worrying that they are overreacting to the world and wondering why they can’t handle certain stimuli as easily as most others seem to do, that was the part of your post that hit me the hardest. Obviously, I’m sure that wasn’t your intention, but just providing some potential insight. 


On the other hand, I also find her advertisements for her own bakery very silly and unnecessary. They don’t really take that much away from the book, but they certainly don’t add anything
I loved it so that’s where one positive review came from 🤷🏽‍♀️"

Is there some lodges provided by Operation Friendship that takes people who are less than 65 years of age? 
GEF lodges are like... 65 and older, right?
This place has vacancies. A bachelor unit is $1010 a month.

[https://standrewscentre.com/](https://standrewscentre.com/)

Why is her budget $900? If she moves into an assisted living/long term care home her AISH amount will change as she's no longer living independently.

AISH will end when she turns 65. After that she might qualify for OAS, GIS and CPP or CPPD. Those programs all have to be applied for and take time so it's important to begin as soon as possible. CPP is a minimum of 120 days from the time you submit your application.
Check out leston properties. My buddy got a bachelor there for $950 and missed the cut off for the a subsidized unit by a few k of income so I’m guessing your mother has no income and likely on aish so should qualify."
Starting a grassroots movement to get workers compensation laws to change at the federal level and hold insurance companies like Sedgwick responsible. Anything you would add or stories you’d like to share about your experience?,21,WorkersComp,"Workers' comp is a state by state issue.  The federal government can't touch it.  Take it up with your governor and state reps.  As always, use your vote to make your voice heard!
Just fyi- I don’t believe Sedgewick is an insurance company. They are a middleman between the worker and the insurance company
Every day, my job (adjuster) brings me a little closer to either taking a bath with a toaster plugged in and set to ultra dark or to sinking myself into student loan debt again to become a petitioner's attorney because I hate these employers just that much. I'm also the first person in my workplace to suggest a strike or forming a union to solve any tiny problem, so I'm personally and totally with you on the spirit of this.

And of course, I realize this is merely an outline of yours. But with all that said, some of these do not make sense to me even as abstractions yet to be refined. A lot of your points here are already things even if we presume that no federal system to standardize workers' comp across the country can effectively be created:

1. You can file a retaliation suit for termination secondary to filing a claim because that is considered a protected class.

2. Statutes and case laws do define what are compensable injuries, and this includes aggravations of preexisting conditions, mental health conditions, and repetitive stress and other occupational claims.

3. Labor unions can and frequently DO get involved in an employee's claim. Like any intervention from the union, the employee has to simply ask for help.

4. Alternative dispute resolution? That's what workers' comp fundamentally is; it is the alternative to torts/personal injury. In every state I've ever handled, the workers' comp claims are litigated in a separate court than the civil court. The alternative in New Jersey, for example. would be the NJ Division of Workers' Compensation where the judges are distinctly and formally referred to as ""judges of compensation.""

5. As for expanding access to legal representation, I don't know what you could possibly recommend beyond Google (as I doubt the Yellow Book in a physical form even exists anymore) and word of mouth.

I think, too, that you overlook how workers' comp is employer insurance; it is NOT the employee's insurance. It is noble that you want to create a universal healthcare equivalent to workers' comp, so I won't ever disagree with how respectable your ambition is. I actually admire you for being this passionate and driven to instigate significant changes.

However, I'm curious as to your understanding of the workers' comp system irrespective of anecdotes and emotionality. What you have here seemingly reflects only personal experiences (whether yours or others) and emotions. While it's fine to have emotions in any discussion of public policy (and I actually encourage it), there still needs to be an understanding without the emotions; that starts with how you (the one wanting change) understand the system as it currently is.
Like I said in the other thread, this is a voting issue. If you vote for people who want to strip workers of their rights, you’re going to get employer friendly WC laws. Each state makes their own WC laws so the best way to initiate actual change is by voting for people who support this change from local county elections all the way up.

https://elanaspantry.com/wellness/ms-neuro/
can we not equate diet changes with ""non-traditional remedies""? There is loads and loads of data and evidence backing up the idea that changing your diet can alleviate many medical conditions. Not in the same ballpark as healing crystals/homeopathy or whatever.
Definitely! Diet is important. I currently have a nutritionist that is helping me with a solid MS/anti inflammatory diet. It’s hard sometimes financially and physically to eat the right things. I cook every meal for myself. I meal prep ahead of weeks that I know my fatigue will be high. Cooking for one is a lot more expensive than cooking for two though. 

I do the right things. I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t smoke. I stay relatively active. I take my medications every day. I save where I can. There’s just a difference between living and surviving.
I second that. Diet isn’t necessarily a “non-traditional” remedy. However, if you’re replacing medication with a drastic diet adjustment then I could see the relationship."

 On Mental Health Benefits and Learning Process - Just Got my First boardgame ! 😊,20,soloboardgaming,"I'm searching for the same, a hobby that takes me away from my RL mind but also into the here and now \^\^ into the actual act of playing :3 I try to look at learning a game as part of my fun and my hobby. Part of the game \^\^ it's not easy and I have to be soooo dang patient with myself... :D
You start at Final Girl then one day you find yourself reading 60 page rule books. 😂😂
Everyone learns differently and what works for some might not work for others. Learning process depends heavily on the game I am trying to learn. I almost always start learning a game before I purchase it to make sure I’ll enjoy the game, either how to play videos or the actual rule book if I can find it online. Then I tend to set the game up and stumble through a few plays of the game while making sure I am getting rules right, this can be tedious but it helps me to lock in processes that each game has. With complicated games or games that confuse me I go step by step and focus on each point, with something like Final Girl certain combinations of killer and environment can have lots of overhead to track so don’t worry about going slow. At the end of the day solo board gaming for me is about having fun, I don’t care about wins or losses or how long it takes to play one game I just want the experience.
This is a great game! Also if you like it, with enough feature films you can create some interesting combinations.

A little correction, i don't know if you fixed only Hans' hearts but also Reiko has one extra. The token counts also as heart

  
Happy boardgaming!
Welcome! You're right where a lot of us started I think. No need to explain yourself here. 

A couple things that helped me out early in the hobby. Final Girl, like most games, is a very particular kind of game. It invokes some stress and it can be swingy - a term to describe when random rolls or events can heavily impact ganeplay. The weight - which describes how complex/hard to learn a game is - is fairly light for gamers, but def has a lot of mechanisms for people early to the hobby.

All that is to say, there is a LOT to explore :) There are so so many types of games that range in theme and mechanics. Personally, I like Final Girl, but it's not one I play often as a ""go-to"" game. I have to be in the right mood.

The YouTube/reviewer space for board games is huge. This sub is really good. Enjoy watching/listening to people about what games are out there."

"do you think that everyone who tries to will eventually shift, or not?",20,realityshifting,"i believe that everyone who keeps trying to shift will eventually do it, and it's mostly about the composition of our community and specifically why *we* are attracted to shifting. 

- if anyone has the ability to shift, everyone does. there's nothing about shifting itself that would be an innate ability, but some people are more inclined towards meditation and focus, which allows them to shift faster. 

- everyone who tries to shift, on some level, believes in shifting and their ability to do it. 

- everyone who is attracted to shifting as a concept is open-minded enough to allow it to be a possibility. 

- the skills of meditation and focus *increase* in time, not decrease. 

- you will know yourself better the more that you try to shift, including what methods work for you, what you enjoy doing, what feels comfortable, etc. 

shifting is a skill just like any other, but it's the only one that we think has less likelihood of working the more time passes.
I think it takes a well rounded foundational understanding of what this all is, and why it's ""hard"" to do anything in this field.

People live human lives but ultimately we're not human, were the energy moving through the human body. We take on this/these roles but we continue to exist long after our human bodies die. 

Now, as a person we learn through rigorous testing and boundary pushing from our youth that we need to guard our minds against foolish thoughts like ""if I jump off the roof with an umbrella I'll float down like Mary poppins!"" (Been there as a kid, ouch, don't recommend) and as you grow you become more jaded I would say. And as far as your human life goes that works quite well. You learn to doubt yourself healthily.

Now someone springs on you that you CAN float like Mary poppins, or literally anything else you desire! Now what's the catch? Well, you have to go against your human instinct to doubt. And doubting is hard to deny, it's literally keeping you from an early death in a daily basis. But the voice that tells you what you can and can't do is quite literally not you, not who you are ultimately. And it's hard to fight. I've lived my life as a rational and skeptic and the idea of living based on my desires and choices was ridiculous. Even more so the spiritual. But I went through a dark night of the soul (more like dark 3 years of the soul if we're being honest) and that pushed me to pursue psychedelics as a form of last ditch help. They put me on a path of spiritual awareness. 

So what I've learned is that the subconscious thoughts are the hardest to change because that's where your truth lies, in my opinion. You can think you want to shift and think you're in control but there's a part of you deep down that tells you how you really feel. And there's not much I can say other than my growth continues daily and I've noticed my subconscious thoughts more than ever. And sometimes they're WILDLY negative, but you have to learn to let that go. More importantly they're overwhelmingly positive these days and the doubts are almost non existent, and that's why I've been able to go from here to a better cr and back. I'm so much more in tune with myself and the world and I can literally see the changes I want appearing. Now things aren't always perfect, and there can still be subconscious doubts but just like bad thoughts at any point, notice them and move on. Bit by bit you mould yourself into the person you want to be and with that self alignment comes beautiful experiences in this life and beyond.

Long ass comment, **TL;DR: You have to believe in yourself wholly (laaaame but that's what it boils down to)** and if you think you believe already and it's not working, think again honestly. Who are you? Why are you here? What do you REALLY want? Is there bad shit in your life? Well you chose it. You're a shifter/projector/God/awareness acting human. YOU CHOOSE, right? It's the only way to shift so remember that! Keep working on yourself, your self love, and your self worth. The only way to progress in my experience and once you experience the next rung on the ladder you look back and say OF COURSE I can't believe I didn't see it or feel it until now but it's unmistakably true. And you grow more and more each day.

If anyone has anything to add or rebut I'd love to hear your takes.
no i think everyone has the potential to shift, but some people won’t ever shift due to giving up/lack of belief in themselves.
unfortunately i’ve been wondering the same thing. thank god i’m slightly egoistic so i simply Can’t accept the idea that /i/ might be one of the people who fall into the category of being unable to shift but whenever someone says “anyone can shift!” im always like welllll how would you know ? it’s not like i 100% believe that that’s not the case, maybe everyone really does have that ability but i just don’t think there’s a way to know really ?
i do think eventually they are going to shift, if the never give up. a lot of people that haven’t shifted just gave up and im like… now the possibility of you living your dream life is at 0. id rather take the chance of maybe shifting then completely give up on it"

"AITA for Refusing to Visit My Injured Boyfriend (Now Ex) After His Mom Yelled at Me and Shared Private Information with Family Without Apologizing

",18,AITAH,"Mom just sees you as competition and made sure to get you away from him. He was too weak of character and literally told you who he was. He would chose her over you. Count your blessings now you can find a man that will stand up and stand next to you as his priority. You deserve better.
Honey, this situation is a dumpster fire, and you’re standing there with a broken hose, wondering if it’s your fault the house burned down. It's not.

His mom? A meddling nightmare who threw you under the bus, then backed it up for good measure. She shared your private moment with the family like it was tea at Sunday brunch, and *he* let her.

You bent over backward to be supportive and respectful, but instead of backing you up, he folded like a cheap lawn chair. The fact that you had to beg for basic respect is all the proof you need that this relationship was doomed. Girl, you didn’t ruin anything—you dodged a bullet wrapped in mama drama.
It was incredibly kind and loving of you to stick around and try to help him out during his rehabilitation, especially helping him shower. There was clearly nothing sexy about it, the guy's skin was flaking from lack of bathing. His mom wasn't helping him, or he wasn't comfortable asking her, and you were doing them all a great service. 

His mother felt replaced, jealous, and was made at him. She told you it wasn't targeted at you, but it is understandable that you felt caught in the middle. 

If there was a moment you could do over, I would not have demanded an apology from his mother and refused to go back over to his house until you got one. Mothers like that are really tough to take on, and a son like him is going to choose his mom and dad and family every time.
He stopped being a friend a while ago. You reached the state of apologising for being mistreated. 

Your ex is a coward hiding behind his mother or you to avoid standing up for himself, definitely won’t for others - and showed you repeatedly he isn’t in your corner. Remember support should go both ways. There no point liting  you on fire to warm up someone who will happily let you burn. 

You cannot restore the dignity of him as he has none. He cannot be respected as he has none for others. 

Why do seek acceptance from those who blatantly disrespect you and choose to not even show you a shred of decency?

NTA except against yourself
NTA - You did absolutely nothing wrong. It sounds as if you were very respectful. Your boyfriend's mom is enmeshed in a weird relationship with her son, and he threw you under the bus. You sound like a great person, and deserve so much better."

It makes me cross when they just say ""you have a degree so you must be fine"". Stephen Hawking had degrees coming out of his ears, doesn't mean he didn't have any disabilities 🙄
Reapplying, instead of challenging this decision (first with Mandatory Reconsideration request and then, if unsuccessful, with an appeal to the Tribunal) would surrender any backpay from the beginning of this claim. 

If awarded after reapplying you will only be paid back from the beginning of the new claim, not the old one.
I'm in a similar situation (applied for physical (hypermobility) and mental health (general + autism), and there was heavy reliance on the fact I was doing a Masters and therefore was ineligible). I was given no points at application, none at mandaotory reconsideration and 19 at tribunal. So the next step (I assume you already have the assessment report - if not ring up the PIP helpline and request this) is to begin drafting an MR, you can do this over the phone or post (I found post easier). Basically try and see what they've used against each activity (or overall) and refute this. For instance for the masters, I sent in my student support sheet, and contact with the disability team, however, this wasn't viewed as 'relevant' to give me points until tribunal (bad wording but they kinda just ignored it until tribunal where I got a chance to speak). In terms of the HSD, the evidence I gave was a screenshot of my NHS app, and then evidence of my physiotherapy and detailed muscle weaknesses which seems like a lot less than you provided so very odd they didn't consider it.

Basically - apply for MR. Read the assessment report and criteria for PIP and explain why they have misinterpreted something, or why the Masters is actually not relevant to any descriptors etc and send this off. I personally don't think it would be worth waiting to re-apply with the new diagnosis as it would explain the issues you have now, and wouldn't (I dont think) change much, other than your symptoms having a new name. You could get citizens advice to help with the MR, or you can do it alone if that's easier.
Lots of people who have PIP work, it’s not means tested. I was a full time teacher when I got full PIP, enhanced for both. However if what you’ve said you can’t do/ struggle with is something you’ll do in your job (like if I said I can’t read but I’m a teacher or someone is a music tech and they’ve said they’re full deaf etc) they’ll give you 0 points for that. 

Don’t give up, appeal and take it all the way to the tribunal if need be. Anytime you get additional diagnosis (though I don’t know what having a diagnosis on EDS over having the hyper mobility diagnosis will get you, unless it’s for the comorbidities that EDS can bring) you can add this new evidence to your next appeal/ tribunal. So don’t stop and wait, the wait is so long, it’s much better to continue with this application."
Terrified of Mobility Aids (MAs) ,17,cfs,"Dude, I felt the same. In hindsight, I should have been using a cane years before I did. I should have used a rollator when before I started using a cane, and I should have used a wheelchair at the time I started using that rollator.





years and years of senseless pain that I could have avoided if I had not been too proud.







My suggestion is that if you feel like you need it, then you need it.
I 100% understand, where you're coming from. But there is one thing I have learned from having a dog with behaviour issues in the past, which I think applies here as well.


When it was recommended that we use a muzzle (just in case), I did not like the idea. I was wondering what people might think and how it would change how they interact with the dog. I then very quickly learned that this was exactly what we needed. Other people being able to see that the dog was struggling, allowed them to be more accommodating. They gave the dog more space, didn't approach the dog uninvited and didn't overreact to the dog's barking, because it all made sense to them. She still got pats from the right kind of people, but always on her terms. That, in turn, allowed the dog to be much more relaxed and happier. In a way, using mobility aids is similar. Aside from these aids providing the physical support you need, it helps people seeing your invisible health condition and being more accommodating. They will likely also take your struggle more seriously, because for a lot of people invisible disabilities aren't as serious and visible ones. So, it will likely not only make the physical side of things easier for you, but also reduce the struggle of having to constantly explain what others cannot see or understand.


I ordered a collapsible walking stick yesterday, as I'm also finding the transition difficult. This way, I can carry it in my bag and just use it as needed to begin with. This may not be a solution that works for you, but maybe you can come up with something else that helps you easing into it a bit more.


Also, based on the experiences of people I know, who started using mobility aids, they all hated the idea to begin with, but every single one said that they're glad they gave it a go once they tried it. 
I have the same problem, walking triggers PEM for me but I'm scared to use a wheelchair. I'm scared of what people will think. I think I'd probably need one that I don't have to push myself because that would probably trigger PEM too but I don't think I can even afford one of those anyway. I had to quit my job and I'm not well enough to think about claiming benefits right now, it's way too stressful. 

Having to stay in the house so much is bad for my mental health too. I was always outdoorsy and all my hobbies were active. This illness just sucks.
I understand where you are coming from completely. I have gotten to the point in life where I know that I can't control what others think. Using an aid makes life that little or much easier. Frankly others who make a comment or judge, they are not the ones who have to deal with the pain or PEM. Would they suggest a person with glasses not wear them? I'm sorry the people around you aren't giving you the support you deserve. Sometimes if a person like a Doctor, or someone like that backs the idea it can help the naysayers. Good luck.
I get it. I started using a cane last week. My knee was really messed up. But it started to feel better so I stopped. And now it’s hurting again. 
So I guess moral of my story is just use it because it really does help. 
And people were so nice! I was ya know acting normal and stuff and I had someone open the door. A guy let me go ahead in line so I wouldn’t h e to stand. And then when I dropped my cane someone ran over and picked it up for me. It was a pleasant surprise"
‘Dreaming big’: Fort Worth nonprofit unveils mobile mental health care unit,17,FortWorth,
Would this be allowed here?,18,ufyh,"Habitat includes the garden - I think it should be allowed. I would love to see some before and after, and with the same angles and light would be amazing. I work equally on unfucking the garden and home as they are both part of my sanctuary.
I think that yard stuff would be fine without explicit permission, since it’s already visible to the public. But it’s also about her feelings, not just ethics, and you’d know that better than us. :)

If you do a post for the yard, I’d be happy to take a look and give you a list of steps of how I would go about tackling it. [Here’s an example of another post in this sub that was looking to do a yard overhaul, and the list of tasks I suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/s/0ytTT5GYzP). Maybe you’ll get some inspo to get started, and maybe you can even show your mom! The poster made a follow up post when they were done if you wanna check out an after.
I wouldn't post the pictures- your mom doesn't even want you taking them. Descriptions should be fine.

Once you have your plan, ask your mom what she would prefer you to start with. For example, if the grass bothers her the most, start with whatever needs to happen to mow the lawn. 

I saw below that you think this could be her sanctuary and it might build up to inside the house and I think you're right to start with the garden!! But I would start with safety issues as my first focus in the garden (ie get rid of the big toys that are trip hazards before worrying about weeds in the pavement cracks). If/when she gives you permission/it's time to tackle the inside, again start with focusing on safety issues.
I really don't think you should secretly photograph your mom's mess, and definitely don't post the pictures online if you do.
Go for it! I think garden is habitat. Agree with others though re permission re pictures."
Improving Measurements for Loneliness and Isolation Act,18,lincoln,"You can [read the bill here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6284/text). 

It looks like it's just the creation of a working group to define metrics that can/would be used to measure isolation/loneliness, as well as research methods to collect that data, across the US.

The problem they're trying to solve right now seems to be that right now the actual scope of the problem isn't clear and it's hard to compare states/regions to each other because they're all measuring this in different ways and with different levels of detail.

The bill does not propose specific interventions (e.g. opening bingo halls in the name of ""public health""). It only proposes that a working group be convened to figure out how to collect and standardize data/metrics around loneliness and isolation. It doesn't even compel anyone to actually collect data -- the end product is that the working group will deliver a written report describing the types of data they think should be collected and possibly the extent to which the various federal, state, and local agencies are already collecting and sharing this data.
I’d love to hang out with my friends but I work way too much to afford anything! Maybe raise the pay so I don’t have to work so long and I’d have time to not be lonely!
Known this dude for a while and he’s the guy that can say a bunch without actually saying anything.
This is one of those ""even a broken clock is right twice a day"" moments.  I bet this bill has strong bipartisan support.

EDIT: I just checked and it was co-sponsored by Flood and David Trone (D-MD).
Is this really that much of a mystery? People are having to work 60-80 hours a week to afford rent and groceries. Daycare costs more than most jobs pay. You have to drive everywhere because nothing is walkable. Everyone's health is declining because Covid causes long term damage to the immune system and accelerated aging. 

Creating a community takes time and work and everybody's worked to the damn bone already. Sounds like a bipartisan effort to send a few million bucks to someone's nephew at Deloitte."
binder lines?,15,FtMpassing,"It's probably the combination of your height and hair, not your binder in particular.
Don't worry about the lines; lots of cis guys wear an undershirt that may look similar.
You can’t have your hair short for mental health reasons?
Sorry man, The binder lines isn’t what is doing it at all. Lots of guys wear undershirts. It’s because of your hair and your shoulders and hips. At least in my opinion. Your shoulders look a bit more narrow than your hips in my opinion, and slope in a feminine way. Even just doing some at home upper body exercises will improve this. And help to give you more of a upside down triangle appearance
Any chance you could layer an undershirt and see if that helps?"
2 year natural progress ,16,naturalhypertrophy,"Fantastic work! 
Up almost 20kgs in two years is amazing. I've been through the same and I know what that takes, so much respect to you. Going forward, just trust the process and don't rush it, even though progress inevitably slows down. It's a marathon and not a race. Hoping to see another post in a year or two!
Natural indeed! What did you do for your forearms, besides the arm wrestler curls?
Use them removing your post as motivation. You're only 17. You will blow up by your early 20's if you keep at it. You seem very knowledgeable for your age and training experience
Dude, I had no idea about Korean Jacked Jesus before this post.....I just googled it and I am fucking CRYING 😂😂😂😂 Thank you so much for sharing that. I am super proud of you brother..i can tell you are so committed..you are going to be in such good shape as an adult, just NEVER NEVER quit..obviously listen to your body and rest when needed, but NEVER QUIT. You got that fire in you, I can tell, never let it become embers, bc it is hard to rekindle. You're on the right path man, 1000% FOR SURE
What are these pictures? Can you post pictures of your whole physique so we can see the full progress"
My BPC-157 experience after 7 days. ,14,bpc_157,"Are you injecting SQ, on the site of the injuries or just in stomach/thigh fat? 

I’d definitely recommend adding TB500 as well as they apparently work synergistically. 

I buy them separately and reconstitute one, then when fully mixed, remove that solution and reconstitute in the other peptide to so it’s exactly 50/50 but if the source is good I’m sure the blended vials would be fine.
No Tb-500? I did double that bpc157 dose as well. 

But Damn… and I thought my back issues were bad. That’s rough man. 

I’d be trying everything under the sun if I were you though. I am for my baby herniations it’s changed my life.
This was a great read! So happy for you! I'm glad you're getting the results that you should be. This is a success story! Thank you for sharing it with everyone and proving to the world that this stuff works! I'm looking forward to seeing more of your postings. Thank you for sharing your experience.
Wow, God bless you man! Lol, I have woken up a few times on a few DZ's also, with dudes screaming medic. It always cracked me up when one dude always said, ""Oh shit, this is the medic"", lol. I've had some fucked up landings but nothing like what your showing. I hope it all goes well for you brother. I'd raise up a glass of beer for you, but I dont want to fuck up the momentum. So I'm going to wait for 7 weeks out for the after report. Good luck to you man. I really hope things go well. God bless you.
Shit dawg, nice to hear improvement markers.
But also, don't do that to ur back bones. 
Try harder.

Jk"
He has no business talking to people about mental health….,15,encompassfarmgossip,"Yikes. Seriously hope nobody listens to them for medical advice. That’s dangerous. And they aren’t even giving any alternatives lol just “be grateful for everything” blah blah blah. I guarantee Gio basically told depressed Abbey at one point to just stop being depressed
Also, note, they are losing followers daily. Just between last night and this morning they are down another 200.
This is actually such dangerous advice. This man has shown that he does not understand the complexities or nuance in the topics he attempts to sound intelligent with.
Yuck he is truly a nasty human.
Yeah, that video made me want to throw things through the phone! Maybe I need to increase my meds 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂"
Good to have for surgery ,15,spinalfusion,"Great list. Glad you're doing well. Keep sharing you progress!
Great list. I had XLIF L4/5 robotically assisted with decompression 9 days ago. I would add the following that have been a huge help.

1. Satin sheets, easy to slide around on
2. “Bed rail”. Amazon has a million choices ranging from $30 on up. Makes getting out of bed a lot easier using the “log roll” method that hospital PT will teach you.
Why no visitors? The hospital I was at allowed someone to stay overnight, I didn’t opt for that and sent my husband home for the night but he could’ve slept on a cot in my room if I wanted him there. 

Definitely bring ear plugs and an eye mask for the hospital stay, it never gets truly dark and quiet in hospitals. There was a lady down the hall screaming all night and being yelled at by her family and nurses during my stay. I got exactly 0 sleep. 

In addition to your list the handiest thing I had was a tablet stand and a remote page turner for my Kindle. I alternated between having my Kindle and my Switch hovering over my face with the stand while I laid in bed the first few weeks. I still use it even though I don’t have to now that I’m recovered.
My goodness, you're even more organized/proactive than my partner, and I didn't think it possible!

I'm 7 weeks post-op and probably not healing nearly as quickly as you, but I'm getting there slowly but surely!

I just wish I'd seen this post 2-3 months ago!!
I’m assigned female at birth and am astonished at the high calorie and high protein you are eating. I gain weight very easily if I eat more then 1200 to max 1400 calories a day, even when I was able to exercise. I’m also mid 50’s and only 5’ tall, so that’s probably got a lot to do with it. 

7 days Post surgery and I don’t have an appetite at all. I’m struggling to force myself to eat something every couple hours. Today it took me all day to eat a cheese stick and a peach. This is not typical for me and probably contributes to my reaction to your intake. 

Do you think your level of pre surgical training enables to to be able to eat like that? Would you mind sharing a typical days meals/snacks?

What brand of protein shake do you like? 

Thanks!"
Mental health resources.,15,Alabama,"Bitch to the people in Montgomery.
It’s like that pretty much in most areas in Al. We have a family member that the only way to get treatment is to state that there is drug/alcohol abuse and get them admitted to Crossbridge or another facility like that. That just keeps them from harming themself for a short time.
Had close family that had to spend time at Searcy in Mount Vernon. 

I'll never quite understand how we had actual, factual mental hospitals back in the day, and likely had * less* public awareness/acknowledgement of mental health being a part of public health. 

Now we more awareness of mental health needs than ever, and...well hell, we can't keep rural hospitals  viable for expectant mothers."
