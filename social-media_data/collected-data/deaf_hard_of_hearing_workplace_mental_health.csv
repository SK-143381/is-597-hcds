I don't understand what the wife wants. She may be not delusional but she sure is crazy and inconsistent. Does she only want a punching ball? What did she think would happen? I hope OOP can divorce her stupid ass quickly, but she seems determined to drag this on...
The realization is hitting Grace that she let her family get to her. And she‚Äôs too prideful to backdown.
This is the problem with religious cults. They get their hooks into you as children and then, when you‚Äôre a stressed adult, you pull them out for comfort like others do with a homemade chicken noodle soup recipe. It‚Äôs dangerous and insidious.

I'm getting really tired of therapists not being autism-aware,304,AutismInWomen,"She sounds like bs for nt people too
1. If someone finds ""big words"" pretentious, that's a them problem, not an issue for you to deal with.  
2. This is just silly. There's obviously a difference between casual social relationships and a professional therapist-patient session. This is especially dumb since she's done it herself...  
3. Some people do find it weird, some people don't. Decent people will not make a fuss about how a compliment is phrased as long as it's genuine, though. Again, why is it on YOU to baby and coddle other people? They can use their words. Why was this therapist implying you need to just conform harder? Jesus.

Finding a good therapist is such a chore. I had a PTSD therapist who was just as annoying and clueless, and I don't get why it's seemingly so prevalent. Do these people all just go to the same university and get taught that people with ASD just need to be convinced to stop being so weird and conform better? I'm so glad you ""dumped"" her because this shit is just insufferable.
Frustrating. You're not alone.¬†


After 6 months of trauma therapy, I decided to disclose to my therapist I suspected I have autism. (And that it likely played a large role in my cpstd and how I process trauma)


She told me it sounded like I was just looking for another label of something 'wrong' with me üôÉ
You gotta get yourself a therapist that is also autistic themselves. 

I had 10 years of traditional therapy as an adult and a few as a child and I guess I‚Äôm alive but they definitely made a lot of things worse. 

I found a therapist who specialises in somatic therapy for autistic people and has a couple of PhDs in ND research. She‚Äôs also AuDHD like me and I‚Äôve made more progress in 18 months with her than I have with all previous therapists. 

Try this [directory](https://ndtherapists.com) and see if there‚Äôs any near you? Mine is double the price of a regular therapist but honestly it‚Äôs worth it to not have someone to tell me to ‚Äújust stop thinking about it‚Äù.
This is why I plan on pursuing master and doctorate in psychology."
AIO for telling my boyfriend to fuck off ,299,AmIOverreacting,"Girl this is not going to get better... dont ask me how I know.  Plan your escape.  Give him the ultimate, a job , counseling and 50/ 50 house work or you're out.  You are just raising a man child at this point

My sister went through this. Her bf got expelled from college for fighting and she became depressed and dropped out. She worked and enrolled in night classes while he sat in their apartment playing video games, expecting her to cook dinner after a three flight walk up with groceries.

I ordered her prenatal vitamins so she had what she needed while getting almost no rest and even less help from him. He enlisted to run away but ended up getting somebody else pregnant while in basic training.

She moved back into our parents' house and had her baby and they lived there. Our parents paid for her divorce so she had full custody of her son and didn't have to deal with the deadbeat. However, I'm told that he tried to apologize and get her to take him back when he was dishonorably discharged (for fighting again!). She laughed in his face.

So, you did a great job from this angle. No woman wants a grown-toddler and you took care of what needed to be done.

And, I'm sure we're going to get an update sooner rather than later that ditched the unnecessary weight.

Kudos!

Jewish in the Police ,191,Jewish,"Only you know what the personal and professional stakes would be, so take my words with a grain of salt, but consider writing about this in a more formal, in-depth way, perhaps for publication.

I am really sorry to hear about the bungled investigation. I had a very similar experience in NYC. I feel like we grew up hearing that this kind of hate crosses a clear red line, so it's jarring to realise that nowadays it doesn't. Welcome to the mirror universe, I guess.
We need more Jews in police and security fields. 

And Hamas must be destroyed! Quickly and without mercy
I'm also in the UK and i can imagine how difficult it might be within the force trying to convey the nuance within which Jew hate operates. 

I just wanted to say, I was in the national CST briefing yesterday evening and the officer who presented was absolutely fantastic, so I just want to take off my hat to her and all the work the police do to support us. 

You guys get a lot of criticism so it's important that you understand we absolutely recognise the brilliant work you do.
It‚Äôs as though a switch was flicked with the Hamas attack on Israel. All over the world casual anti semitism was suddenly normalized. In my personal opinion Before Oct 7 we Jews generally felt that both the memory of the Holocaust and the existence of the state of Israel were somehow providing us with a shield against anti semitism and we felt pretty confident about being Jewish in the various countries we live in. With the attacks and the overt antisemitism that was unleashed, that feeling dissipated. One reason it might be difficult to get police to react is that in recent years there has been huge effort to police hate crimes against minorities and LGBT folk but because Jews have been so well integrated in society and have not been experiencing significant hate  crimes a generation of law enforcement has not been dealing with this issue. We all have to adjust to this new reality and it is possible the hate will end when the war ends.
Ingrained racism and antisemitism take time to uproot, and from everything I have read, I think that is a problem in the UK right now. Thankfully, the Corbyn years are over. This article in today's Haaretz seems like a start, as it does depend on education at every level.

Being a HCA has completely put me off nursing ,137,NursingUK,"I'm a TNA, and on my base ward I'm in the HCA number for my long shifts. On my short shifts I shadow nurses.

All that to say - I've had 3 shifts in the 4 months since I've started where it's just been me and one HCA, so we've had to split the workload in half and look after 12 patients each.

I keep saying to myself and other people that I'm not sure how many more of those I have in me. It's so unsafe. 

I completely get where you're coming from!

And I have raised it with my Educator and university. Both aren't able to do anything about staffing levels obviously, but I made them aware so that I'm not suffering in silence at least.
Would you consider trying out other fields? I was a hca on an adult amu which totally put me off nursing, but I switched to work on a paeds ward and now I'm about to qualify as an rcn. It's totally OK to write off nursing - but if the idea still niggles at you sometimes it might be worth trying out a different field.¬†
Firstly- I applaud you for taking on such responsibilities and dedication to our patients. You'd be a fantastic healthcare professional in any field.

Secondly- have you thought about taking it to Freedom to Speak? Freedom to Speak should be able to signpost you to where to raise your concerns about staffing on shift and the risk you clearly understand is present everyday with your workload.

Really hope you're protecting your wellbeing
Remember, that nurses don't have to work on wards or a&e. Lots of areas that aren't that pressured.
I was a nurse in the USA. An LPN, so my license didn‚Äôt transfer. I was sexually harassed at one care home, transferred to another that was fooking horrific. The team didn‚Äôt use gloves, cross contaminated patients, didn‚Äôt care or document falls. 

It put me off nursing here. I got fired for mithering my team about PPE, trying to get soaps and hand sanitizers filled and used and documenting falls appropriately. It was one week before lock down. I called CQC and they called and told them what the complaint was and when the inspection would be. They passed with a ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

It is ok to protect your body and your mental health. If your heart isn‚Äôt in it, and you‚Äôre already this burned‚Ä¶ choose another path. That‚Äôs the beauty of the UK. Education is affordable here. Don‚Äôt choose a path that will eat you alive. It‚Äôs ok."
How do I (33m) effectively convey how important having my family around is to my orphan wife (32f)?,111,relationships,"I think it's very reasonable to want to be near your family. There is nothing wrong with that urge. But I think you need to go to your wife with a direct ask. Because you're right, she had a different childhood than you and probably isn't the right person to get emotional support on for this. She likely doesn't know what you're looking for.


But maybe, if you say ""honey, I want to move to x-city and be closer to my family. My parents are getting older and I miss them. Can we start planning to do that with a target of x-date?"" If she says no, she's never moving, well then you have tough decisions to make. If she says yes, isn't that best case? And if it's something in between you've opened the door of communication.¬†


So I think you need to decide what you want the solution to be, and then ask if she is willing to work with you to get there.¬†
Did you say ‚ÄúI want to move to XYZ and be closer to my family‚Äù

If she says no you decide if you can live with that or not


And kids of your own??   You are both in agreement??   If not that is a dealbreaker
I think people are being tough on your wife... Moving to a new country is HUGE. If this is not something she agreed to do one day, I think it makes sense that she might not be ready to make the move ASAP. That being said, maybe you need to tell her this is really important to you, and make it clear you need her to consider the possibility. Someone mentioned couples counseling, and I think that's a great idea.


I get her having complicated feelings about family. As someone who has had my own struggles and has a partner with a tight knit family, I doubt she doesn't ""get"" it. I'm guessing it might bring up difficult feelings for her. It's painful to be faced with the love and support that you never received. But as your partner she should also want what's best for you... And hopefully she can work through these challenges in therapy.


Canada is a bit of a shit show. I don't know where exactly you want to move - I'm sure the situation varies province to province, but cost of living is crazy, housing is unaffordable and healthcare is a mess. She would be lucky to find a family doctor, let alone the mental health supports she needs. I would really consider this aspect of things - consider what she needs and see if you can make a plan. Can you pay privately for therapy? Are there psychiatrists you can get her referred to? Consider what supports she's receiving and whether you are able to access these supports in the community you are planning to move to.
This might be something to go to couples counseling about, since previous attempts to communicate about it seem to be her not taking it as seriously as you do. I agree with others, I don‚Äôt like that sometimes it ends with her getting comfort from you but I think a third party could help change the dynamic and help you get more to the root of the issue.¬†¬†

¬†I relate to this a lot. I also moved away from my family‚Äînot as far as I used to live but at one point my goal was just to get far away because that‚Äôs what I needed for my independence. I don‚Äôt regret that at all but I also dated someone with few family connections, and realised I was thinking my idea of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to be close to my family‚Äù was me comparing myself to people I grew up with who now live next door to their parents. I have zero desire to live in my hometown, but I DO value those relationships a lot and I am glad I live closer now that my parents are also getting older. Anyway, back to my ex. This wasn‚Äôt a factor in our breakup, but sometimes it felt like they just didn‚Äôt comprehend why I would want to see my parents and childhood friends so often, why my parents would help me out with stuff (and vice versa), or even why I was talking to my parents about stuff in my daily life (they would think it‚Äôs none of my parents‚Äô business bc THEIR parents didn‚Äôt care). It was like, I don‚Äôt need you to be BFFs with everyone else in my life, but we couldn‚Äôt even cross over the bridge of them understanding why I even had those relationships in the first place. And I wanted them to care a little more, like maybe remembering my family members‚Äô names after years of dating. Anyway, it was just an ongoing low level frustration that I didn‚Äôt really register I was dealing with until after our breakup. Again, this isn‚Äôt why we broke up and things were improving in some aspects so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily something I would‚Äôve broken up about either, more like almost a cultural difference that I think we could‚Äôve put more effort into addressing‚Ä¶ and honestly something I‚Äôll be looking to avoid in my next relationship.¬†
>Every time I see them, they're a little older. I know it sounds stupid but it hurts to see.

This is not stupid.

>¬†Or the third being where she ends up being upset about how she ""took me away from my family"" and I end up having to console her.¬†

Do not console her. Do not let her deflect from your issues by making them about her.

>I don't get to talk about family stuff with her because it upsets her, so stuff like old places I want to show her or family movies she won't participate in.¬†

This also is completely not OK.

>I feel guilty because I made the decision to move here knowing this would happen, so I'm pretty much solely to blame for how I feel.

I mean I sort of get it but, she has no family. Why can't you both consider moving back home to where you live, particularly since your family loves her? She gets the family she never had, you get your family back. Why is this not an option?"
" Critical, negative ‚Äúfriend‚Äù",85,GenXWomen,"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a shitty thing to say, Barb.‚Äù Repeat as necessary. She‚Äôll ghost you and save you the trouble.
I've come to the realization that sometimes friendships run their course, and that's ok. I had a friend that I knew since grade school. We used to do lots of things together. I didn't have kids, and she eventually had 3. When she had her first, we would still get together occasionally. But by the time she had all 3, our relationship became one where I only ever heard from her when it was a gift-giving occasion for one of her kids, or they had a school fundraiser. It was clear, though, that she still made time for her other friends who also had kids, so I just let that one go. I'm not an ATM.
I would ghost her. Just quietly fade away. Or suddenly become too busy for anything to do with her. I have no room for constant negativity.
Unacceptable. I think leaving her a short message saying pretty much what you‚Äôve said here is the way to go.

I know we‚Äôre in an era when ghosting is seen as normal but it‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs going to think you are just busy and if she‚Äôs in the wrong she needs to hear it.

I had a friend who was been extremely paternalistic. I told him the advice he wasn‚Äôt giving wasn‚Äôt helping me and I didn‚Äôt appreciate him talking like my dad and I asked for more respect. He never apologized and stopped talking. Some people are emotionally immature brats.
I recently had to cut someone out of my social life for this very reason. She could take ZERO hints about my decreasing availability, and I was becoming miserable. I basically just said ""I'm not up for this any more,"" and stopped hanging out with her. She hates it, and it's arduous for me, but I am *so relieved.*

It's made more complicated by the fact that my kid is close friends with her kid, so we still are in each other's orbits, but at least I'm not spending an hour or two listening to her bitching, just waiting for her to leave, any time she drops then off!"

My family isn‚Äôt the best, but I make damn sure they treat him with respect. I‚Äôm so sorry you went through that. They‚Äôre being unreasonable.

Can you explain this a little bit?¬†


>How do you navigate partner's rude hearing parents like this?


The bottom line, as that you and your partner should have a little sit down with their parents and discuss this. Discuss the reality of your deafness.¬†


Be polite, and be calm, and try not to be too accusational. How they respond is going to dictate what you need to do next. If this relationship with your partner is very serious and long term you might just want to distance yourself from your parents.¬†


Strangely enough, my own parents have always been worse than my wife's parents, we moved far far away.¬† I live a 5-hour drive away from my parents. Sometimes it's just better that way.

Hey man, there is a ton going on for you guys right now.  I genuinely  feel like this is outside of the scope of peer advice.  Are you guys in couples counseling?  If not I would recommend stop what you're doing right now and find a counselor you guys can see and talk to together, as absolutely soon as possible.  I know this is generic as hell advice, but y'all are in a spot that I don't know that you can work through without outside help.  Emotions/hormones can be off the chain after birth without the chaos on both sides of the fence and a universe of distance and coldness between you.  She's likely suffering some depression between what she did, what you did and the baby and it may be completely out of her control.  

I know that when stuff is heard out of pure emotion, it makes it seem like it's coming from the truest and most core place from a person.  So all the stuff you said and did to her, no matter how many times you say you didn't mean it, she is going to believe that that is how you feel and you're only now backtracking to try and protect her feelings, which is likely somewhat true.  

Please get the help you guys need, neither of you are in a good spot and you are both suffering unbelievably by life's circumstances at the moment. Go to her when you can, be gentle, hold her, don't backtrack or say you didn't mean the stuff you said.  Simply tell her you understand she's sorry, that you're sorry and you want to get help to work through all of this together which it sounds like is true.

Sorry man, I wish I had better advice to give
You dug a hole right where she dug hers and now you both are so twice as far down in the pit. It will take either a small miracle or Herculean effort from both of you to climb out - maybe both.

My heart breaks for both of you and hope things get better.
I think sometimes we lose sight of the consequences of our choices and actions. As your WWs choices had consequences do have yours since dday. Have you ever asked her how you can help with the goal of you both being equals in your relationship and moving forward as partners and not as hostages or punishment?
Please try couples therapy.

Ifeel like you need to instead of saying you didn‚Äôt mean the things you said, say what you actually believe. Tell her she‚Äôs being a good mom without her asking, tell her you miss ‚Äúthat top‚Äù that she used to wear and how radiant she looks in it, tell her you love her drive and ambition and that you want her to go back to work so she can continue building her career, tell her she‚Äôs beautiful, smart, funny, amazing, whatever you think about her."

There are aspects of this we are prepared for, I sign and encourage everyone to learn. It improves accessibility for both the deaf and neurodivergent. That doesn't answer your question.

I've talked with therapists and ABAs, there exists a point where children in these extremes just get trained to comply. I don't like that, it treats a human like a misbehaving pet, but our society doesn't provide other options for parents. The parents are ultimately just required to comply too.

The gift solarpunk could give is nuance and patience. Almost all the aspects of solarpunk are about nuance, that we can make things better and minimize harm. That you could be part of a community that could both welcome you and make space for your child. That the question of, ""what do they need to grow"" could be asked instead of ""How could they be made to stop or go away""

You won't ever be ""normal"" or in a normal situation. I'm hoping we get better at accepting that ""normal"" isn't a real thing for anyone, but how you and your child fit into society may never be what you want it to be. We can try to make a place for y'all to be weird with the rest of us and do our best.
In addition to what others have said in this thread, I think it‚Äôs also interesting to think that in a Solarpunk society, it‚Äôs possible that some of the stressful triggers for your son‚Äôs behaviors may no longer exist (for example: a loud shopping mall, or the pressures of the school system, or even the language which we use to describe certain things in the space around us which could be triggering for him) as well as the possibility that practices which soothe and help alleviate some of the need for his sedatives/hospitalizations have - in this future - become much more commonplace, so he may find his everyday existence to be much more peaceful than what it is under our current system. 

Again, I don‚Äôt know your kid, I‚Äôm not a psychologist, and this is all speculation, but it‚Äôs a comforting thought, at least to me.


Edit: typo.
Are you asking how a fictional solarpunk society would handle this or are you asking for RL solutions that fit solarpunk philosophy?
On the way to becoming a teacher, I volunteered at a county board of developmental disabilities, so I worked as a caregiver and basic teacher for individuals across age ranges with significant disabilities, primarily intellectual, and secondly musculoskeletal. There were a lot of things at that place I thought were great. Many, many, many adults working with individuals, giving them enriching experiences, and slowly, slowly making progress. Some students slowly gained the knowledge and skills to maybe, possibly get a job and at least somewhat support themselves, but... the frankly darker reality was that many of the children and young adults I worked with were so facing such exceptionality, that... they'd be dependent on their family caregivers for their entire lives. And that's just, such a heavy damn thing.

That board of developmental disabilities surrounded our students with teachers, and caregivers, and sought to give them enriching experiences. But, there was an unspoken acknowledgement of the fact that the families, and parents depended on us to watch and supervise their children so they could work to support their children back. I think the hope in a Solarpunk world lies in that issue: People shouldn't have to work just to afford to keep themselves, and their people alive. I know for certain that the vast majority of parents would rather spend more time being with their child, and exploring treatments if available, and if not, living enriching lives, than working 50 hours a week just to have an insurance company say their immobile child doesn't deserve a wheelchair, fuck.

So, for one, Solarpunk, and broadly post-capitalist communities afford us time. But, autonomous, communalist, or anarchist communities afford space. If families in need are allowed the time, and space, they will form communities, and in every community there are those that live lives of service, and can offer their time as caregivers. If everyone isn't bogged down circling the drain of poverty, there will be an unbelievable amount of time and space for flexibility to be afforded. So there is hope, but no amount of hope dispels the difficult reality that exceptional disability poses both those affected, and their caregivers alongside them. I think, regardless of the economic or social framework we live under, doing the right thing for those affected takes a lot of work and struggle.

All power to you."

Facebook Comment,52,WOACB,"She‚Äôs a medical ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt know how to spell HIPAA? Also, HIPAA only applies to that persons medical team. 

For example, if Gypsys nurse shared Gypsys records, that‚Äôs a HIPAA violation. But if Gypsy gives her medical records to someone and that someone puts them out on the internet, that‚Äôs not a HIPAA violation.
What if the internet decided to start blaming KJ for all of her son's issues? And that's all we talk about. Its all her fault he is medically fragile. Its all her fault that he can't do all the things he wants to..she would flip her shit.
If she doesn't even know how to spell HIPAA and I'm always suspicious of anyone that has multiple children and they all have medical conditions like what are the odds. My neighbor has four children all with different supposed medical conditions she's a drug addict. They all have learning disabilities because she used while pregnant and she makes them seem as disabled as possible to get the disability check. I don't hold much weight in this commenter
HIPAA. I don‚Äôt believe this commenter
I‚Äôm not even American and I know HIPAA is not spelled HIPPA and this person claims to be a medical professional? Also how did Gypsy‚Äôs medical records become public? How did KJ get hold of them. If Gypsy Rose stopped putting her whole life out there, the gossip content creators wouldn‚Äôt be talking about her, they would move on. Gypsy Rose wants to be talked about, she wants the attention.

A message to people with aphantasia.,48,shiftingrealities,"Have you ever thought about how shifting mechanically works? Visualization is one of the tools of what can help you feel your desired reality, is it possible that total immersion and dissolving yourself into your desired reality is a necessity in order to shift? That is, a complete refocusing from this reality into another? So your perception is completely shifted to a different picture
I saw someone say ‚ÄúThink Blind‚Äù and it helped me A LOT mentally
I do not believe there's a mechanism for shifting, and as such, don't believe there's any such thing of how it ""mechanically works""


I can tell you from experience that you don't have to be totally dissolved in it to shift. In fact, shifting without visualization is possible and even common among successful shifters. Like I said in the post (I think?) I was shifting successfully even before treating the aphantasia


I'll try to liken the process to something else: affirmation techniques in the present reality. If you want to improve your life somewhat, e.g. improve your confidence, you don't have to literally flawlessly visualize yourself as that person. For some people, you really can just affirm
what does that mean?
Yes, I understand that, in fact I have no problem with visualization, I can literally just exactly dissolve into the picture I‚Äôm making up, but why I asked about the ‚Äúmechanics‚Äù of shifting is because I don‚Äôt understand the act itself, what‚Äôs behind it. I out of boredom or for fun visualize and imagine different scenarios all the time, could it be that just the intention can allow me to have whatever I want? Im just trying  to understand how to activate this act. Maybe it‚Äôs some kind of meditative state or half asleep or complete refocusing, there is something that unites all methods.  I understand that there is no one true answer, but is it so easy that just by visualizing and believing you can be there?"

We're forgetting a vital detail: Andrew was just 14.,38,AndrewGosden,"I think people underestimate his intelligence whilst overestimating his level of social awareness and independence. I was friends with someone like him through secondary school before I moved for A-Levels and at 14 he was sitting the local maths and spelling bee olympiads and held gold prizes in regional maths competitions. I always felt that whilst he was academically smart he was remarkably naive and poorly socialised owing to his preference to spend most of his time at home or in school clubs. 

With this in mind even though grooming is a likely theory, it's equally as likely that he was simply a naive young boy who met an unlucky and unfortunate end. 

***as always: if you have a tip, please submit it--no matter how small***
100% I was a moron at 14. Tho being a girl
I maybe was slightly more wary of certain situations.
Very valid points, I'm now leaning towards it being an impulsive decision on the day to just see where the day took him
I don't think you can so easily generalise about 14 year olds. In many ways I was more cautious as a kid than I am now, as I've had life experience to know it'll probably be okay and ah well if it isn't. I was a real worrier when I was 14.

My point is that the stereotype about kids being impulsive and lacking caution isn't always true. Andrew going to London was impulsive, I'll grant that, but it doesn't mean he had no caution at all.

Also, the idea we've missed something in not considering his age is quite strange to me as that's been a large part of the concern from day one.
I have a friend who works in the MoJ on research work to do with the most horrific crimes, and when I mentioned this case to her she said very matter of factly: ‚Äúoh that case. Probably human trafficking. He looked like a much younger kid - someone tricked him and he was done for. It happens way more than people think.‚Äù

I found it interesting that many people deride human trafficking theories as being far fetched, yet this person who works in a field that researches that kind of crime specifically said it‚Äôs a likely case of it."

As for diy, check out the side bar on /r/transdiy and read posts describing what other people do. They have a lot of resources, and I think this subs mods prefer DIY details to be discussed there.
From finland and doing diy. 

1. Most suppliers usually take bitcoin, I use coinbase as my wallet. It was very intimidating for me too at first, but it is not too hard. When you are about to buy something they give you an adress that you post into the wallet and send the money that they asked for. The wallets usually take a fee so remember to add at least 5‚Ç¨ extra. 

2. I have gotten both E vials and progesterone through the customs but pills are harder to get through. I dont know what amount would be safe to take through but I wouldnt chance any more than 2 vials at a time and 3 months worth of pills at a time. Pills do have an experation date that you can check on the packages, vials however will last years if stored right and havent been in contact with the air. The normal vials in diy has enough in them for 9-12 months of use depending on how much u use each time. 

3. I use 29G insulin needles but you can use any Gauge from 23-30G. The issues with smaller needles is that it takes longer to get the E into the syringe, the issue with bigger needles is that its bigger and if you dislike needles the bigger ones are worse, the bigger ones can also core the vials however that mostly happens with 18-20G. I can let you know where I got my needles in a dm if you want, you might get some from aptekki but idk. 

4. I can dm you but also check out r/transdiy, there they can talk about sellers.

Ok man, I'm going to respond seriously. God help me if this is all a worthless shitpost, but I'm about to treat you like someone who is genuinely reaching out.

First off, I have all respect and some empathy for your diag. My wife has ADHD and I've dealt with PTSD, the others are more foreign to me but I want to say that I'm not attacking you.

That said, regardless of *any* other circumstances - if you are losing *every* job you have, the problem becomes less and less likely that it's the job and more that the problem is you. Luckily you're able to realize that possibility. 

I'm gonna split the line here: I recommend learning about, going to therapy for, and embracing your own quirks. But I'm also going to recommend you *focus on masking at work*. There's a reason the phrase ""Fake it til ya make it"" exists - it's right. Don't go against your ethics or make yourself miserable, but treat it like you got a role on TV to be a dishie or prep cook. You're just an actor, act the role and go home.

Eventually, with time and work and help, you'll be able to find a compromise of that fake shit and who you really are. And you'll probably be able to do both at the same time in some way even. But right now you're fucked because you're forced to be ""normal"" before you have the tools. That's why I say just pretend you're on stage or something.

The rest falls in place. It always does. That, or you smarten up and get a better career. :)

Doctors saying using a mobility device for pain isn‚Äôt good,14,FND,"fnd being a mental illness / psychological condition is an unfortunate misconception many doctors have

fnd can be affected by your mental health, of course, but so can things like parkinson‚Äôs and heart disease

fnd is a real neurological condition (and even if it was entirely psychological), your pain is real and if using a mobility aid helps you live your life than i think that is enough reason to continue using it :-) personally, i use a rollator to help with my fatigue and involuntary movements/gait dysfunction from fnd and my doctors (who are among the few that do not believe in the conversion / mainly psychological theories about fnd) support me using it
I think of it like this: the doctor is considering *one* area of your health. It is much, much healthier for your *overall* health that you use a walker (or another aid) and continue to go out and socialise and go to school and have all these important experiences, than if you just stayed home because you can't walk far without the walker, and you're trying not to use the walker. *That* is the choice you have to make right now.

Personally, I use a stick. I use it as little as I can, but I always have it with me. If I didn't have the stick, I'd have to say no to walks with friends or trips into town because of the fear of what would happen if I lost balance or muscle control. I'd have to put all my weight on my partner again when it got really bad, like I did before I had the stick. It's a horrible feeling being totally reliant on someone else, even someone who loves you. My walking stick lets me rely on me.
If you‚Äôre in pain and need support, then have the support. That doctor isn‚Äôt living your life, feeling your pain or understanding the difficulties you‚Äôre having with walking. You do what you have to do to live as comfortably as you possibly can.
This is really disheartening to hear but unfortunately a very common experience for people with fnd trying to get the help we need. I use a foldable walking stick for my bad days, it's great because i can take it anywhere and I'll use it if needed. But that's most days for me. 

I had a similar experience with my mum involving a walking aid. I had an episode where I couldn't use either of my legs due to weakness(this happens once in a while) and so after talking with my friend who has ME and a whole other myriad of conditions, she offered me her old walker to use on days where neither legs can support myself.

When I brought it up with my mum she said that it was ""dramatic & embarrassing"", ""would just take up space"" and ""a waste of time so don't bother"". She felt like my dad would make a big fuss about it too. So then what am I to do when 3/4 of my body isn't working??? Those episodes don't happen often but I should have a way to deal/live with them when they do happen right? So frustrating.

It took them both a while to accept that I need my stick everyday, your mum will need time to adjust to that new reality too. Just be firm on how you feel about this, its your body, let her know that you need this, that you need her support. Best of luck
Use it when you need it, don‚Äôt use it when you don‚Äôt need it. Listen to what YOUR body is telling you & adjust accordingly.
Fnd is not the same thing all the time , it‚Äôs constantly changing & we need to learn to adapt to those changes to help our body & mind get stronger.
That‚Äôs what mobility aids are for. They are called AIDS for a reason, they aid or help you when you need them.
I have two different types of crutches, a walker & a wheelchair.
Sometimes I‚Äôll go through all three in a day, some days nothing at all.

Anyway, a few days ago we got the news, that they plan to lay off all the contractors. Everyone will be replaced with indian workers.

Healthcare workers support group ,11,Gwinnett,"Not a healthcare provider, but I work peripherally in Public Health and I can see it with many direct care providers. Heck, I am often able to recruit well for PH administration positions  from direct care workers because they have such unfair expectations for patient care, volume and compensation. 

Personally, I have seen many instances of practice admin failing to adequately protect and support their physicians and practitioners. The job market is the job market, but to not have accountable support staff/physician-nurse extenders is an absolute killer for patient throughput and follow up. This is a labor market challenge for many industries, but as you and another commentor mentioned, there is this expectation of customer service as a primary vehicle for care rather than providing quality care. No one went through years of specialized education and schooling to be a customer service rep. 

I am currently in the process of switching my primary care provider here after me and my pharmacy had to call my primary care practice upwards of 5 times to approve a blood pressure medication I've been on for the past decade (I had to get emergency meds from the pharmacy over the weekend due to the lack of response over a 1.5 week period). They also failed to call me to discuss the results of a CT they ordered and only called me once I went to the practice manager (who changed since I started following up over roughly a 2 month period). 

The standard of care has fallen by the wayside in my opinion, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of advocacy on the pieces of the system that helps it to be sustainable (human capital) and we continue to be driven by profits. People are going to continue to get burned out and it's sad to see it happening and feeling like there is nothing we can do.
I work in social services at a SNF in Gwinnett and my job has become increasingly more difficult in the past year.

I work 50+ hours a week and can‚Äôt afford to rent a $1600 apartment but these 80+ year olds living on $1200 from SSI are someone expected to pay $4,000-10,000/month depending on their level of care‚Ä¶
No offense meant, but the vast majority of doctors I've seen in my life have been extremely unhelpful and dismissive of me. I have had to *fight* and *argue* for every single diagnostic test and bloodwork order - which, guess what, *confirmed* what I already knew was the case.

I will never forget my gynecologist in 2010, just minutes before my diagnostic laparoscopy, scoffing that he didn't expect to find anything and would be done in 20 minutes. Almost two hours later, I woke up and he informed me that my uterus was fused to my intestines by endometriosis lesions. Lo and behold, the pain he scoffed at wasn't in my head.

When my thyroid swelled and I could feel that something was wrong, it took *three* different endocrinologists before I found one that took me seriously (outside of Gwinnett!), and she diagnosed me with Hashimoto's - which I had suspected from the beginning, but other doctors dismissed me and said I was fine. I was not fine.

I'm sorry for what you've experienced, but there is a *damn good reason* why patients don't trust doctors now. It's really freaking hard to find a good one that will take patients seriously about genuine health concerns.
My HR literally refers to patients as ""customers"" now and urges staff to do the same.
I‚Äôm not a healthcare worker but I am a women who has experienced complete dismissal of major health issues over the years.

NTA nobody is actually. you deserve to have a life and make guiltfree choices that benefit your health and happiness. You still are close enough to help when needed and when things get better you may even find parttime caregiver or home cleaning to take that off their list. Choosing for you should not be so hard to do. It does't make you selfish. And there are pleny options to compromise a way to make it work. Good luck to you all and I hope you and yr cousin get to enjoy this next chapter in life :)
NTA. 

But if you do move , and I think you should for all the reasons mentioned, perhaps check with your county about services that could come in to assist them both.  Leaving your dad with some resources may help you feel less upset
NTA. It's alright you want to improve your mental health and live your own life. It's a tough situation, but it's important to prioritize your well-being.
NAH - definitely move out and take care of your mental health. Depending on where you live, inquire with Adult Protective Services about help that both your dad and grandmother is eligible for. I suspect they can get meals brought in, helper care to help bathe etc. Then maybe you commit to 1 night a week to help your father, where he can go out and get a rest, whilst you take care of your grandmother.

You shouldn't be arguing about individuals working physical labour jobs wanting a pay rise.

You should have a problem with the illegal Bikie gangs and standover tactics their union has used to achieve their dominance.

Also don't be jealous just because Woolies has a neutered broken union that's not fit for purpose.
Btw, the CFMEU does support RAFFWU - they've outright endorsed them over the SDA, which is huge. They weighed in on the fast food BS that was going on during covid as well https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.smh.com.au/politics/federal/john-setka-s-cfmeu-branch-lashes-un-australian-actu-leadership-20200508-p54rak.html. CFMEU/MUA members also attend RAFFWU protests/events etc.


We have far more in common with the CFMEU than we do with vicious anti-union elements and the media they control.
What do you mean tone deaf? Solidarity is the power of us all coming together on a common struggle. Touch one, touch all.

AITAH - because I want to almost sever contact with toxic family ,11,AITAH,"It sounds like you are in a tough situation with difficult family dynamics. I think what's most important is to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. It's not easy to set boundaries and stand up for yourself, especially when it involves family, but it's crucial for your own happiness and well-being. And don't worry about being the ""asshole"" in this situation, because sometimes you have to do what's best for you even if it may not please everyone else. Hang in there and take care of yourself and your 8 year old. Sending love and support your way.
NTAH - It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, especially during a high-risk pregnancy. Don't let anyone bring you down, even if it's family. Surround yourself with positivity and supportive friends, and don't be afraid to set boundaries. As for your son, it's great that his grandmother is supportive of his autism journey, but make sure to prioritize your own well-being first.
NTAH- You are definitely not the asshole in this situation. It's important to prioritize your mental health and set boundaries with toxic family members. Your fianc√© is right, it's your choice and don't let anyone guilt trip you into tolerating their toxic behavior. Take care of yourself and your son, and remember that it's okay to distance yourself from family if it's necessary for your well-being. Good friends, sleep, and staying positive are great ways to cope with difficult situations. Hang in there!
Definitely NTAH (Not the A\*\*hole Here). It's completely understandable to want to cut off toxic family members, especially for the sake of your mental health and wellbeing. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and set boundaries, regardless of what your family may think. And kudos to your fianc√© for being a supportive partner. Stay strong and keep taking care of yourself!
First of all, I'm sorry for all the challenges you're facing. It sounds like you have a lot going on and it's great that you're seeking help and support. As for your situation with your grandmother, it's important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. If that means limiting contact with her or setting boundaries, then that's what you have to do. It's not worth sacrificing your own happiness for someone else who is causing you stress. And it's great that your fianc√© is supportive and encouraging you to make decisions that are best for you. Just remember, it's okay to put yourself first."

Best basic signs to learn for deaf roommate?,8,deaf,"I would recommend taking the questions you asked here and just asking her. She's her own person and what she would prefer may not be what others here prefer.
It sounds like your roommate is fully deaf, so this may not apply but one small thing I tend to ask hearing people to do is when they speak to me, lift their faces enough so I can see them (I‚Äôm tall) and don‚Äôt be confused if I seem to look at their mouth a lot to track what they‚Äôre saying. That may not apply to her but it‚Äôs good for any HOH people you may meet in the future. 

Her app sounds very useful, and I‚Äôm sure she has plenty of experience with it so try not to worry about breaking it somehow. I‚Äôm sure she knows how to troubleshoot stuff like that. If you have the option, perhaps an ASL class might be offered on your campus or nearby - I think even finishing  learning to finger spell could be helpful to you for basic stuff. 

Go by what she says to you! And one minor thing - you note that you‚Äôre not sure if she‚Äôs deaf or Deaf so I would advise that if you‚Äôre a hearing person, Deaf culture can sometimes seem a bit abrupt to outsiders! I only mention that because I know some people with ADHD have higher rejection sensitivity, so try to remember that it‚Äôs likely not her being rude, or you being over-sensitive, but rather two cultures mixing.
Hey a bit outside of topic, what‚Äôs the benefit of someone with mental health related issues living in a disability residence. I‚Äôm curious and want to educate myself a bit more
A lot of signs are more basic than you think. The sign for eat is just holding your fingers together and indicating them towards your mouth, the sign for bag is like you are holding a plastic bag by the handles. Learn to finger spell/the ASL alphabet. Hopefully your roommate is willing to help you all learn, but for sure ask them what they want you all to know (sometimes note writing is the way to go for a while). Good luck!
Does your university offer ASL courses?   That would show your interest or commitment without putting the responsibility on your Deaf roommate"
AITA for threatening divorce over Tacobell,7,okstorytime,"Um, OP, just stop and think how it would feel if your spouse constantly threatened to leave you over every minor fracas. Even 'jokes' get tiresome after a time. Differences in sense of humor are not uncommon with couples, but you must respect that something which you find hilarious may give your partner cause to think you might be serious, especially if it is a near constant refrain.

In other words, stop threatening your spouse with divorce unless you are truly ready for one.
YTA. In your mind it's funny because the thought of divorcing is so absurd. But couples divorce all the time, even after decades of marriage and having kids. Frequently throwing around the word divorce is probably making him insecure. Like ""I know she's joking around, but why is it on her mind so much? Is part of her considering it for real?""

I can see a scenario where you're both very secure and find it funny. That's obviously not what's going on here, and I think you should respect that it's making him uncomfortable. Based on his reaction, I'm guessing saying ""divorce"" every time he makes a mistake or forgets something makes him feel disposable and like you only keep him around because he does stuff for you.
He's told you he doesn't think it's funny so it's time to stop doing it.

If he shouted, ""you're ugly and stupid"" everytime you did something without considering him, would that be funny?

I'm wondering if his parents divorced when he was a kid? If so, every time you do that you're probably bringing up past trauma to the fights between his parents that proceeded the divorce. 

You were right about one thing though, you're an AH. 

Ha

Fellow smart mouth here. You need to go back to basic training in SmartMouth 101. We never try and use they same joke this much. I agree kidding about divorce is not funny. There are SOOOO many lines here you could use. ""Dishonor  on YOU, Dishonor on your COW!!!"" ""Inconceivable!!!"" ""How Rude"" (said in your best girly voice) BUT if you are great at communicating with hubby, tell him if it's Taco Bell.....then always assume you want something. Maybe get something to hang in his vehicle that says ""Always Bring Home Something For The Wifey""
Oh no OP, he doesnt like it yet you did it loads. That's not good. This is not a topic to joke over for some people. He obviously takes his vows seriously, which is refreshing in a society of infidelity and selfishness.Not hating on u, just speculating on how u got to where u think this is ok- is it because society has taken hold of things that should have some sanctity in them, like marriage and make a mockery over it? 
Hope u sort it soon and shower ur hubby in the love and comfort he needs from his wife."
Deaf peer helper around the world,9,deaf,"Deaf mentor is what we use (America) if this is the same concept you reference.
I‚Äôm not sure exactly what you are asking. In Australia we have Deaf support workers which is very common. They are people you can hire through our national disability scheme to assist you with a variety of tasks. They are part of our community and their work isnt really viewed positively or negatively.
Not formally. Here in Sweden there is a strong tradition of associations for sports, hobbies and disabilities. It‚Äôs through those we offer communities, support and try to advocate for things. Right now we offer a series of five support sessions called ‚ÄúBefriend your hearing aids‚Äù. 

Traditionally support has been provided through the health care services. They have everything from audiologists, ENTS, counseling, psychologists, technicians and sign language teachers to physiotherapists. Maybe 15 years ago, I was at a brilliant week long rehab session where I met others with a similar background. Such things are too expensive now, so there definitely is a switch to putting more burden on the non-government associations.

I‚Äôm not aware of how much support is available for parents of Deaf children. Besides parents getting 240 hours free sign language courses. (Which isn‚Äôt really enough.)
From India - Nothing formal but there are social groups that people can get help from.
Are you talking about hearing people that help deaf people? I think OP is referring to deaf people who help other deaf people.  Which isn't something we have in the USA,  We do have peer support groups for hoh/deaf people but there's no official or government endorsed system or program for such things."
Pregnant with a reactive dog ,9,reactivedogs,"Behavioral Euthanasia posts are sensitive, thus only users with at least 500 subreddit karma will be able to comment in this discussion. 

Behavioral Euthanasia (BE) for our dogs is an extremely difficult decision to consider. No one comes to this point easily. We believe that there are, unfortunately, cases where behavioral euthanasia is the most humane and ethical option, and we support those who have had to come to that decision. In certain situations, a reasonable quality of life and the [Five Freedoms](https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2018/11/what-are-five-freedoms-and-what-do-they.html) cannot be provided for an animal, making behavioral euthanasia a compassionate and loving choice.    

**If you are considering BE and are looking for feedback:**

All decisions about behavioral euthanasia should be made in consultation with a professional trainer, veterinarian, and/or veterinary behaviorist. They are best equipped to evaluate your specific dog, their potential, and quality of life.

These resources should not be used to replace evaluation by qualified professionals but they can be used to supplement the decision-making process.

Pregnancy is a special time and being so stressed and upset is effecting you and your unborn child. Is this reactive dog worth more than your health and the baby's safety? Ask your husband that question and if he promises to put safeguards in place, you'll NEVER be 100% perfect and you will absolutely need to be 100% perfect. And it's funny how these  shelters and rescue tell people ""this poor dog was abused and neglected by their former owner"" - it's more likely this dog had issues before your husband adopted him and the shelter created a sob story, which does no one any good.
So what HAS been done for this dog?

Has a trainer been involved at all? Has a vet consult taken place and the behaviours discussed? Have meds been tried?
He‚Äôs had the dog for 8 years, and he has definitely gotten worse with age. Although to be honest he‚Äôs never been a super chill dog. Most people are afraid of him. It doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs a pit bull lab mix, so most people have some reservations solely based on that. 

Anyway, yes he is a super stressful dog and I think I‚Äôm OK now while pregnant but I‚Äôm very afraid when the baby is born.
You sound very stressed, and that definitely will affect your pregnancy. Maybe talk to your doctor about this and explain the perspective and I would say that they can explain how maternal health is so incredibly important from conception to birth. Allowing a dog to rule the household and damage your personal life isn't good for anyone. You will grieve for a bit If you decide to go the BE route, but not long after that you will wake up feeling stronger and more focused on the important things in life. You need to keep perspective and keep things in priority order: If you wrote up a list of things that are important in your life, the pets should be at least four or five things down, unless it's a service dog that helps with your mental health, not harms it."

You aren‚Äôt a bad person. You‚Äôre just super unlucky that a simple mistake had such an awful outcome. 

Allow yourself to grieve. Allow your partner to grieve. And keep an eye on your relationship. While this was an honest mistake it‚Äôs the sort of thing where resentment could definitely fester if communication breaks down.

Hi OP. I'm so sorry this happened to you. When you're feeling overwhelmed with guilt, remind yourself that you're hurting too. Don't make your hurt hurt worse with the guilt. You loved your dog and they loved you. Full stop. This sucks so much for you. Like another person said in this thread - let yourself grieve. Your partner is going to be sad no matter what you say or do, so let them grieve, too. I get the need to manage their feelings right now and that probably is in part to help ease the guilt. 

I really hope you can ditch the guilt and just let yourself miss your dog. Sending you a big hug."

Keep your kids away from this menace
I don't think you are TA because you're doing what you think is best for your children. I don't know that I would keep her from the kids if she's a good grandma but it would definitely have stipulations like, them not going to her house. I just worry about my kids emotions a lot and if they haven't seen any abuse from her and she's really good with them, then they probably adore her. I know sometimes we have to do things like that to protect ourselves and our children but I feel like there's so many underlying issues, I'm almost positive she must have some sort of mental illness to be so toxic, which makes it unbelievably amazing that she's a good grandma. I would love for my kids to have that. They don't because my mom was emotionally and physically abusive but she never gave a crap to bond with them. So when I decided to cut her off I told my children they were more than welcome to still call her and see her. But they didn't care to, because she hadn't put in any effort with them to make them feel loved by her. If she's good to them, even if she was awful to you, please consider the positive impact it will have on their life having a loving Grandma. This is just my opinion, from what you have told us,and you know what they say about those. üíú

AITAH for not loving my mother anymore,4,AITAH,"Your mom makes you and your home unsafe.  She is violent.  You have every right to cut her off
You're not the asshole for protecting your own well-being and feeling unsafe, especially given the abuse and mental health struggles you've endured.
NTA. Your safety must come first, and if that means keeping distance from your mother, then that's what's necessary. A common misconception is that blood ties require you to endure all forms of treatment with grace, but that's not the case. It's sad that she's not taking her medication, but it isn't your responsibility to bear the burden of her choices‚Äîespecially when they lead to violence. You might be young, but you have the right to a safe environment. Consider documenting these incidents if you haven't already, and seriously consider reaching out to social services if you're in danger. Remember, it's not about assigning blame to your mom for her illness, but about taking steps to ensure your own wellbeing and that of your siblings. Stay strong.
NTA. Your mother is the AH. I understand that she is sick, but she is making the decision to not take her meds which unfortunately is all too common with people in her situation.  As soon as they feel better, they go off. Your mom needs to understand that there are consequences to her actions and it's your dad's job to deal with that not yours. Currently you are in a dangerous situation that could go bad at any time as shown by her choking you out. Tell your dad about that because if she can go that far she could go farther. Please talk to an adult not only for your safety but the safety of your siblings because if she can target you, she can easily target them.  I wish you the best of luck.

Your mother is severely abusive. She's a threat to your physical and mental wellbeing.

While it's not her fault she's sick, it IS her fault she isn't taking her medication.

You're doing the right thing by standing up for yourself and protecting yourself from further abuse."

Worried about making a complaint to my union?,5,AFSCME,"I hope you luck and I wish I had something meaningful to contribute. My local is filled with incompetent money grabbers and fail to even reply to emails. I had to speak to management for a resolution. If it‚Äôs possible I would see if you can possibly seek a transfer
Best of luck brother , having my own issues with this same union. Iv gone up to the national level and can't get any one to lift a single finger to do what they are being paid to do.
For a first step in making contact - check out your own local contact into at:

[https://www.afscme.org/local](https://www.afscme.org/local)

As soon as you talk to a real person anywhere around your own local, tell them that you want contact info for your member action center.  That should help to get you in touch with consistent representation and info updates in the event that your local is not correctly furnishing those things.
AFSCME completely failed to protect me when I was written up for my opinions given on a mandatory survey. Our rep had quit and those above him failed tremendously to assign someone to help up or inform us pretty much right when this happened. I didn‚Äôt know I only had two weeks to fight it. One creepy guy from above in ASCME finally came to one of our meetings and put his hand on my knee and shifted blame on me and my coworkers, all who have not been well supported over the years.
I was coming to ask a similar question. AFSCME is completely ignoring me and my colleagues regarding abusive management practices and a whole bunch of things that are grievance. People are quitting, taking early retirement, taking long leaves, etc.  It‚Äôs completely demoralizing and of course affects our ability to do our jobs. 

There‚Äôs a lot of big talk from stewards about the need to be together and present a united front, strength in numbers, and the importance of joining the union. We‚Äôve united! We are union members! Yet get ignored, retaliated against, and made examples of by management. Others don‚Äôt want to involve the union because they see what‚Äôs happened to us. 

Union has made some piddling efforts to communicate with management but get ignored, and nothing changes. Where do we go when our union won‚Äôt help us? Management sees the union as a joke. Understandably so. 

Note: when we leave the State, we are no longer paying dues! You‚Äôd think that would spark some concerns. Management seems determined to run us all off through retaliation and constructive discharge."

Doing the right thing ruined me financially,4,Vent,"i don't believe in god but i believe in justice and karma. you did the right thing. which might not reward you at all but its will be better for other people to say the least some conditions improve because of it . still an improvement . if you god was there or afterlife is a thing you will be surely in a good position. maybe in the future you will get a better job that you wouldn't gotten since you still working there. or worse you could injure yourself in the job if you haven't gotten fired

life is full of what ifs . but as long stay true to yourself you will at least say you did the right thing.

Season 14 thoughts ,5,WaterlooRoad,"I assume you meant dean weaver is exit was a little sudden considering he was in the last 3 seasons but honestly not be bothered actor did great of course but the character was never a fav of mine.. I definitely loved the friendship between Preston & Noel.. 
-
the endometriosis storyline was actually portrayed amazingly they don't tend to do those sort of storylines in shows so I loved that they had some representation on it hopefully it doesn't just get forgotten about though
-
I'm not sure where they are going with schuey I also thought he would get a redemption arc after the ending of the last season but it seems they went the other way with it.. I'm not sure if to expect him to go even further next season or what tbh
-
Absolutely loved the deaf storyline too I thought it was very moving honestly this season is probably my favourite from the reboot so far..
Schuey is being the way he is as he has been given no direction. he's almost lost his sister in his mind and no one cares about him no family members. He's never had a role model but now there's no one to not disappoint so he's able to do what he likes.

I fully agree with your point about Steve though.

Gamer girl (Mog) didn't feel like it was her place to talk to Billy's dad about the bullying and I don't think they knew the extent it had gotten to.
How on earth do I make it do that..
yeah, meant Dean Weaver. Hopefully they'll revisit the endometriosis storyline next season cause while it's so sad Tanya has to go through that, it's bringing focus to a topic that isn't examined much. Was also good that they had Niki not believe her at first, as it shows how quickly parents might dismiss their kids' health concerns (oh they're just being dramatic) but then she realizes how much of a mistake that was. Something I've always loved about Waterloo Road is it teaches us stuff and does so in a proper nonpandering type of way 
My favorite of the reboot seasons is probably the first one as Danny Lewis was such a good character but this season comes close
Hopefully if Schuey is in the next season, the teachers will help him find direction, especially if Kim returns (though she'll probably be too busy to return to the school rn)

Re: Mog, maybe I'm just looking at this from an older viewpoint cause obviously she's a younger student, she mightn't have the same perspective on things that we do but I really wish someone had reported the bullying. Billie's life is over and he's very much a victim in all this, he didn't randomly decide to kill someone, he tried to finally stand up for himself after so much violence and harassment. He never meant to kill Schuey, he just wanted to get retribution and unfortunately it happened to the wrong guy"
Brainstorming/advice on how to address inclusion issue with hearing coworkers?,4,deaf,"I've had to navigate a situation similar to yours. A few things... Sometimes I email colleagues a ""social"" email, asking how their weekend was and sharing a little snippet about mine. I find socializing after meetings gets better results. Making comments in Zoom is much better/easier because you can raise your hand and wait to be called. It helps to volunteer for things, then you'll have an opportunity to interact with/develop a relationship with whoever needs the volunteer. I mostly try to stay quiet during meetings because most people hate them and just want to get out.

Do you have the same interpreter or is it a different agency interpreter each time? Sometimes an interpreter's personality comes through despite trying to stay neutral, and that can be good or bad.
Vou responder em portugu√™s ok? Acho que com o tempo as pessoas v√£o se acostumar com o int√©rprete, por enquanto deixe essa preocupa√ß√£o em segundo plano, individualmente tente se aproximar de cada um dos seus colegas, tenta interagir, para que conhe√ßam mais a tua pessoa e as rela√ß√µes fiquem mais naturais, procure o mais imediatamente poss√≠vel mostrar efici√™ncia no teu trabalho, isso ajuda a derrubar muros.. Sobre as reuni√µes tente n√£o interromper, por enquanto, resolva isso e tire as d√∫vidas depois com teu chefe, daqui um tempo quando os teus colegas j√° estiverem mais pr√≥ximos da tua pessoa, depois de teres interagido individualmente com eles, daqui um tempo se manifeste nas reuni√µes.
Do your coworkers use Teams or Slack or some other chat like medium? Building rapport through a text base medium maaay help ease the way a bit. If there is co text to build off of, perhaps they will feel less awkward about navigating the interpreted conversations? Without seeing the set up and pacing of the conversations I can‚Äôt really say for sure.
Thanks for this. I primarily work remotely so the zoom meetings is how I mostly socialize. It‚Äôs in-person when the problems start. 

I did volunteer on the DEI committee for a year but then my term was up (everyone is supposed to take turns on the committee). The only volunteer opportunities is usually for things like trying out new programs, which involves attending training sessions with the developer and then passing on that training to the rest of our team. So it‚Äôs still not very social, and I find that kind of thing boring/exhausting‚Ä¶ 

A social email is a good idea. I might try that. At the moment we have a biweekly team meeting to discuss projects and at the end we can all say something about what we‚Äôve been up to, but like you pointed out most people just want to get the heck out of there haha. 

I typically have the same few interpreters on rotation. We use the university‚Äôs staff interpreters. I‚Äôve noticed that some are more distant/professional and others are more interpersonal, but the thing where coworkers seem to withdraw from conversation happens no matter who is interpreting.
Interacting one-on-one with each of my coworkers is difficult because I primarily work remotely. Are you suggesting that I should just start emailing or texting coworkers during/after hours to chat? Or schedule some one-on-one meetings to socialize? I would feel so awkward doing that‚Ä¶It feels a little childish, like going up and saying, ‚ÄúWill you be my friend?‚Äù 

I am an efficient worker and have already proven that. During performance evaluations my colleagues have all mentioned it. So if it‚Äôs supposed to break down barriers, that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. 

I often make comments in zoom meetings rather than interrupting, and they also have pauses/check ins where I speak up. The problem isn‚Äôt during meetings. The problem is during socializing/networking."
Not sure where to post this because I AM an asshole,4,AITAH,"Sounds like the only thing that got stuffed was this post with way too much detail. But in all seriousness, this is a serious issue and it sounds like your sister needs some tough love and a reality check. Maybe try showing her some articles or studies about the impact of childhood obesity and how her actions (or lack thereof) are contributing to it. And keep reinforcing positive behaviors with your niece and nephew, like eating healthy snacks and being active. It takes a village and if your sister won't listen, then be the positive role model for her kids.
Thank you. I keep telling myself I‚Äôm going to spend more time with them and then I don‚Äôt do it. I have zero patience as my major depression is intense rn. I will probably pick them up more now though, ad I have a reliable car again. And I will make more of an effort on my end. I have sent her articles. It seems like a perfect way of communicating concern without being direct, but to no avail. I did the toughest of love a while ago (edit: went into detail about my concerns and her part to play) . I even once said her parenting wasn‚Äôt much less than what some get CPS called on them for, she just got super angry at me and we didn‚Äôt talk for a while. You wouldn‚Äôt get it you‚Äôre not a mom poor me boo hoo. I guess I‚Äôll just be more honest and if she doesn‚Äôt like it that‚Äôs not my problem. I hate to stand by and watch it continue to worsen. I personally do my best to teach them about healthy eating and habits, and I prioritize being active and eating good Whole Foods already. I just feel like it has zero effect because they go back home to sodas and chips and all sorts of junk and laziness and filth.
It really was a jam packed post. I was in a mood when I posted this and got totally sidetracked.
They only like junk. When they‚Äôre at my house, I offer different fruits, veggies and dip, fruit bars, nuts, fermented snacks, all sorts of healthy snacks. Zero interest. They say I have ‚Äúno food‚Äù and only want to eat the snacks that are utter junk. And I don‚Äôt even keep much junk as I like to bake and make my snacks at home usually so I know what‚Äôs in it. I feel like I try my best to exemplify healthy habits and then they‚Äôre at home practicing anything but that"

how did you make the decision to get/not to get hearing aids as an adult? (mini vent),1,deaf,"With a good audiologist you should be able to test out a few devices to find the right one. But I think that‚Äôs a step ahead of you. What you could do is talk with them, try a device that suits you for a few weeks (maybe some you don‚Äôt plan to view ur mother in) and then decide if they helped or not. 
If you feel like other symptoms you have are overwhelming the assistance of hearing aids, you are back here. 
If they helped you and you had less problems understanding. Congrats. 

I don‚Äôt really know what to answer to your problems about internal ableism. I either don‚Äôt have or ignored it all my life without knowing. But I love my hearing aids. I love how they look and feel. The ear moulds glow in the dark and they are nice and blue. 

I hope my first part helped you a bit
It can be really isolating if you don't if you already have had hearing most of your life.

I always tell people that you're your own biggest advocate. If your mum is that toxic is it worth keeping a relationship with her when  you can't use something to benefit/enrich your life better?

I think some of this needs unpacking with a therapist as well ideally with someone who has a interest in the Deaf/HoH field.

I can talk, I can lipread, I can also sign. I still make the world accommodate for me with my hearing aids, not the other way around. I know my rights and know what I need and deserve.
I saw my friend get isolated by other 'friends' because she was slow on the uptake for jokes and other conversations. They laughed behind her back that she was always clueless. I always spoke up for her. She didn't realise she had hearing loss and when we looked back after she got hearing aids we realised the reasons she was always one step behind the conversation was hearing loss. It can be isolating.
When I started getting hearing loss I read up about it that untreated hearing loss is a dementia risk too. So for my health and in solidarity with my friend I embraced HAs and I decorate mine and talk about wearing them as much as I can to help remove the stigma
The good news is that you can choose to wear your hearing aids when you want to‚Ä¶. Or not. 

If you have the resources I recommend that you get them and then experiment with wearing them when and where you feel comfortable and you‚Äôll figure it out. 

Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you when to wear them or why. You make the choice.
I have an auditory processing disorder. I wear hearing aids. I know sign language. 

Before I got my hearing aids, when I get a cold, I start to ‚Äúhear better‚Äù because there is less background noise. With the auditory processing you were likely working hard to hear, loosing the hearing might mean that your brain has to work less on filtering and more on filling in the missing holes. 

I don‚Äôt wear my hearing aids all day, but I do wear them when I leave the house and then I may take them off when I arrive at my destination (rare), or leave them on. 

You can always do a free trial and see if you like them. All you‚Äôve done is collect data."

I'd take the dog to the vet to rule out any potential health issues causing his increase in aggression.  Otherwise, they can advise of or prescribe a daily calming aid.  I'd definitely do this ASAP because you want to make sure it all takes effect and works before baby is born.

AITA for cutting contact with my mom after she mistreated my sister again?,2,okstorytime,"NTA - Some people are not redeemable, and you are forced to separate yourself for your own (and loved one's) protection.

Maybe she will get the help she needs, maybe she will turn her life around, but it will have to be without you.  Stay away.  Keep your sister away.  Keep your child away.  Who knows what she would do if given access to a third generation.
I have a similar relationship with my mother. I let her back in when I was pregnant, and regret it deeply. Background: 6 girls, I am the oldest. From oldest to youngest, she has made same mistakes not learning from them at all. She made life miserable for my father since they were divorced (3 children w him) and currently divorcing my step father (3 kids with him). Dragging us all in, verbally abusing now that we are too old to physically abuse. It's so painful when you have a mother like this, but she's a narcissist and will never change. When a person gets chance after chance, still making same mistakes and causing you more grief than happiness, best to go your own way and cut ties. Hard but in long run, you will both be happier
That is a good point.

I tried to make it a working relationship for my children, to let them have atleast one grandparent on their mothers side. (They recently lost they paternal grandmother through a horrible accident and miss her alot)  
  
My mom has always complained that there¬¥s no deep relationship between her and my three children and blames distance and her troubles hearing and seeing for this.  
The truth is she¬¥s hard to connect with and the last time she was here she has more interation then ever before with my kinds and I thought thing would change....  
I later found out that she complained that my kinds were ""pestering her and beeing to loud"" 

Nope. Not ok. You are no longer welcome in my house if my kids can't be kids.

It sucks when her father was the best grandparent ever and basically raised me. Always beeing there for me, teaching me that I had worth and how to navigate life.
I'm sorry you had to go through that. I know what it feels like them grownups drag children into adult conversations...

I struggle with this thinking that my sister is the bigger person for letting this go, this happned to her and she can forgive. I feel like maybe I should do the same?  
But I will ALWAYS chose my sister over my mother and will defend her into eternity since she can't stand up for herself."

Someone as fearful as she is probably could use the assistance of a life guide of a sort (who isn't also a romantic partner). It's kind of a shame this best friendship has become romantic because a romance cannot under any circumstances be the only relationship in someone's life. That's damaging and it makes people feel trapped, isolated and stuck. She needs other influences and if you truly had her best interests at heart you'd try to help her find those. Even if it was just an art class or something. She needs to not be so dependent on you (and you need to not draw so much of your own identity from being needed by her). The situation you describe is just unhealthy and likely to combust at some point.
Bro she loves u a lot dont lose her as she obviously cares about u . Don try to make such joke's in the future and assure her that u won't. As ur getting therapy i hope u get those thoughts behind and fix urself. If u continue to want to die or joke about it again u will lose her . Better urself and assure her u won't ever joke or want to die .Better wife her up in the future."
Need advice,1,mentalillness,"Oh girly, this is messy. You guys have two different ways of communicating with each other that isn't compatible. Not to mention that meds (specifically the ones to treat mental disorders) can really mess with you. I've had plenty of friends go through multiple kinds of depression medications to find the right one. I would keep your distance and maybe reevaluate the relationship. In all honesty it seems like in this situation you two need room to grow. A partner should make you want to try your best not shut you out.

Friend is dead set on being in a relationship that he is not ready for.,1,FriendshipAdvice,"Just remember you are only 1 year older than him, so not to dismiss your own experiences but you are both still so young and still have so much to learn from what life experiences are yet to come, both good and bad. 

Maybe he should ask this girl out and see what she says, just because she has mental health issues and just because he does as well doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt be worthy of love. Maybe it might be something that they can share common ground on and help each other with. 

I can see you care deeply about your friend and only want what‚Äôs best for him, but you‚Äôre only 17 yourself so you may not know what‚Äôs best for him, hell he may not even know what‚Äôs best for him but that‚Äôs life. Sometimes things work out and sometimes they don‚Äôt. Sometimes we have the best experiences and sometimes it feels like the whole word is crushing us into the ground. 

As you get older you will realised that and realises that sometimes you have to step outside your comfort zone and ask the pretty girl out. 

If you feel that his mental health is that bad that any rejection could be detrimental beyond the standard ‚Äúbroken heart and life sucks‚Äù mentality then maybe instead of trying to deter him from doing what you think he should do, instead talk to him about the possible outcomes of what he wants to do. Ask him how he thinks he might feel if she didn‚Äôt feel the same way, ask him what he thinks would happen if they dated for a while and broke up etc. and remind him that no matter what happens it‚Äôs not the end of the world, and that you being his friend will always be there for him. 

I would also maybe encourage him to talk to a professional about his mental health too, it sounds as though he needs to given he is having panic attacks. Is he able to talk to his parents about this? Or a teacher? Or a trusted adult, as it‚Äôs also a lot for another young person like yourself to have to provide emotional support like that for.
No, he won't talk to a mental health professional. I was actually just talking to him about that. He hates his parents and doesn't trust them with his issues, and quite frankly, I wouldn't either, they aren't the most supportive. When I asked him why he wouldn't go to counseling, he told me that it's because ""he doesn't need to get better; They either drug the shit out of you, or send you to the loon box"". Having been sent to the ""loon box"" myself, I told him counselors can't prescribe medication or put you in a place unless they have reason to believe you may be a danger to yourself or others, something in which he is not. 

He also told me that he doesn't want to change because he's ""rationalized"" his problems, and that it's ""not fun so why would I want to do it"". His rationalizations seem to contradict themselves every few sentences, and fundamentally he doesn't see that his problems are genuinely a danger to his well-being, quite literally physically with his heart rate issues. 

Another thing about the girl and him, I'm not saying they aren't deserving of love, but she's definitely not the type you'd want to date. Like I said she has a very long list of mental problems, and there's usually an episode with her every week or so, it can include extreme emotional episodes or dangerous suicidal urges, and that is just not healthy for someone to be in a relationship with, I and several other of my friends have been in that situation, and it was unhealthy for both sides involved every time. 


I'm probably jumping to conclusions too quick, but im terrified to see how this might affect him given how he's taken situations like this previously rather poorly. 

It's tearing me apart inside right now because I feel like I'm being too much of a nag and that I might not be doing the right thing, or that I'm doing it in the wrong way and doing the wrong things. I've seen several friends experience, and have experienced myself what he's going through right now, and I am so damn scared of what he might do.

It really sucks because after a lot of therapy and clinicals and other stuff related to that I have been doing the best I have been in years, but as I've come out of my dark area, I'm watching my best friend go into his. 

I really don't want to hear that I'm probably not gonna be able to help him and I'm just gonna have to let things play out, but unfortunately there's nothing much more I can do than that. I just really worry and hope everything goes well which it doesn't seem like it is for him right now.

I can only speak on my experience with dementia and not the potential personality disorders. For my mother, she had a brain injury which changed the way she viewed things, a lot more fearful and negative. As she aged, we noticed the onset of dementia. This combination made her very anxious and the traditional medication did not seem to help. What finally did help was anti-anxiety medication which helped calm her down and take the edge off. This made her easier to live with and she started to enjoy life a bit more. It will likely take some trial and error, with both anti-anxiety and depression medication to help your father. It took awhile for us to find the right combination and we always presented it vitamins, rather than medicine, which she accepted. Good luck !"

>and often has an angry outburst.

That's his emotion and that's why he guards his emotions.
In every relationship you're going to encounter characteristics where you two are incompatible.

I think you for you, you need to ask yourself if this is too extreme of a difference to make it work long term.

Its possible to work on, but is it too big of an issue... This does hold a heavy weight early on. I kind of expect to hear about this sort of things years into the relationship, not within the first months.

You had a heart to heart the other day and it didn't go smoothly.

Heart to hearts should go smoothly. All you're trying to do is communicate improvement.

I'll be honest, I am not perfect displaying my emotions. But its something my wife wants out of me and I can recognize its a problem. I can accept my partners experience and agree with it.

But your bf... He doesn't put himself in your shoes, nor recognizes it as an issue.... That's impossible to work with long term. You need someone who can drop the ego and attempt to see it from your angle.

And I really didn't like the fact that you opened up about your depression and he made you the butt end of a joke shortly after. That ain't cool and is out of touch with you as a person.

I feel that these are some heavy hitting issues that just shouldn't be experienced this early on. To me, its something about years deep with a person. Its too early to be dealing with this kind of weight IMO."

That's awfully narrow for a scope.

I would advise researching the importance of cultural competence and how having your identity reflected in your provider improves client outcomes. Sometimes the best thing you can do for a client is refer them elsewhere to another provider who would be a better fit.

You really spammed this post, huh?
I was most interested in the detection of ""Augmented"" individuals,  your opinion on what that means, and what to do with that info.

 I ask because I believe we are being hybridized (assuming that is exchangeable with augmented)  by more than one species (currently a couple, and 50+ in total over this epoch) and for more than one reason/goal/motive. Some species take our genetics home with them, some are attempting to augment the nature of our species here on earth. 

To be fair I believe we are a dead-end species on our current path, though without the millenia upon millenia of manipulation from the shadows by dark forces I do not think we would be standing on the precipice as we do now. 

Humanity is naturally a spirit full of love that lives a rich experience when it knows the oneness of the universe, and our current state is truly a sad one. We have become addicted to the  right of conquest. If only we all knew how liberating it is to dispose of materialism. And for those who would mock the idea (and it's not about getting rid of all possessions that's just dumb, it's about not letting the state of our possessions or the total sum of them guide our happiness whatsoever. 

The things I have need to be kept clean and functional those two things matter to me but otherwise there's no extra love. I do love some tools okay I'll admit it some tools have created so much for me that I can't help but enjoy the item. But truly everything in this reality is shit anyways, from the most advanced supercar to the nicest graphics card to the shovel I spent 100 bucks on that I was told would never break. All will turn into a worthless piece of shit, and sooner than you think. 

It would be best to take us all back in time and avoid manipulation entirely (not possible whatsoever to my knowledge) but we've become so addicted to our ways. I don't Believe humanity in its current state would even choose that, we fail to view existence through the correct lens. Logically everybody who continues to carry the torch of violence has to go but with the density shift that's taken care of for us (for others reading my comment that is to say that once Earth rises in density the people who refuse to rise with it will no longer reincarnate here. If you aren't enlightened by the time it happens ultimately this will be your last tour on earth).

 My question is this- do you think it's wrong for the NHI to augment our species as a whole here on earth?
 I do often wonder if humanity could be a little less violent and a little less castle-mentality aligned. Our original makers gave us many gifts however we are ultimately an extrapolation of a chimpanzee and well we all know that perhaps their behavior isn't always the most admirable or to be emulated. The only constant is change I think we could and probably should embrace that a little more."
At what point is a company culture toxic? Where do you draw the line? ,0,careerguidance,"This sounds like a very toxic environment and you should trust your instincts.  I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre being overly sensitive, but I also don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with being sensitive to your surroundings either and wanting to work with like-minded people who don‚Äôt disparage their colleagues and customers. It doesn‚Äôt sound like things will get better quickly, and you‚Äôll only feel worse as time goes on. Your mental health is far more important.  If possible I would start looking for another role. I promise you not all corporate environments are like this. You are not to blame. And you are right to question it.  Good luck and I hope you find something better soon.
Trust your gut and keep looking. Only you can answer those questions. For me when I am dreading to going to work and/or thinking about the place at home I know i am done there
Depending on the industry, there could be wider implications - eg financial services industry has to be able to demonstrate how they make services accessible to those with additional needs, so they would have to articulate how they would support a deaf person, I‚Äôm it sure it‚Äôs mandatory in other industries, BUT, doing it is still good customer service

I would trust your instinct and get out there fast, this is not the way of the whole corporate world, so have faith.  It maybe worthwhile if you do look elsewhere and get interviews to,think of some questions to ask to understand company culture, at that point. Of course there is no guarantee but a company should always be keen to demonstrate their values here.

In the meantime, don‚Äôt sink to their level - if crude language is not your style, don‚Äôt do it to fit in; mocking people, whether employees or customers over, rise above it.
Do not change your the direction of your moral compass for these Neanderthals

I work in a corporate environment (Microsoft). I'm also in the UK. The amount of meetings I would say is pretty normal, The attitude.. OMG that is not right. I don't even know where to start, but please don't accept any of this as normal. This is not banter, this is plain rude. 

My advice: keep quiet, don't engage, and start looking for something else while you are still employed (always easier to find a job when you have a job).
There are so many red flags here, just quit ....There were so many red flags in my previous workplace that I knew it was only a matter of time before it started affecting me mentally. I used to work in the corporate design industry and had already seen how my boss mistreated people in lower positions. It made me realize that I could be next, and sure enough, it happened. One day, my boss blatantly insulted me, questioning my education and calling me 'empty-headed.' He mocked my goal of opening my firm. After that, I decided to quit.

Thanks for reading all of this. I am essentially trying to cut her off, but I think I would become toxic if I tried to control who my friends hang out with. We've been speaking of making plans and taking trips together. I'm asking from an autistic point of view because I don't know. Wouldn't it be controlling for me to say, ""Let's all go do this. OH, and Mary can't come.""

Or even ""Yeah! I'll come to your game night! As long as Mary can't come.""

Are you saying you think I should remove her from the Discord? 

I admit. I am scared to do that. Right now, here's my thought. If I remove her when she hasn't technically done anything against the guidelines, I will lose the trust of the rest of my friends, and it will become a ""piss OP off and get banned"" situation.
You can‚Äôt control who other people are friends with, so if you want to separate yourself then do it. It sounds like while she does some things that bother them, it‚Äôs not enough for them to drop her as a friend.
Leadership is hard.   But this clearly is bothering you so you have to do something.   Is there any option to talk privately to one or 2 wise people in the group and ask their advice?   Be very careful only to state facts not opinions, then if anything you say is repeated back to her you know you were on solid ground.
I have been trying to separate myself from her but not my friends, which makes this hard. I feel like if I just drop all of my friends for not dropping her, I'll be doing myself a disservice. I'll also just be abandoning people when things get hard, which is just avoiding my problems."

I think the lists are fairly self explanatory, they‚Äôre comparable because they‚Äôre all disabilities what‚Äôs not computing ?

( whether it‚Äôs a good idea to disclose disabilities is a different kettle of fish ‚Ä¶)
So they‚Äôre equal in their impact on work? Or consideration for special arrangements? If I have ADHD I‚Äôm the same as a blind person with no limbs? 

I‚Äôm in a client facing role. I don‚Äôt think dwarfism is the same thing as schizophrenia or why we‚Äôre discussing it before we meet. 

Maybe if I understand the purpose? Is it for special accommodation? Liability? Reporting? 

Which leads to that other kettle of fish. And why we‚Äôre keeping it in a kettle.
Assuming you‚Äôre in America, They‚Äôre all disabilities that qualify for accommodations under the Americans with disabilities act and/or section 504 of the rehabilitation act. Not every disabled person is going to need the same workplace accommodations (obviously) and there are some roles where a disabled person may need accommodations vs roles where they might not.

The question is asked because of reporting requirements set out by the EEOC to measure disparate impact on disabled individuals in the workplace. For example if it is known that company X average 30% applicants with disabilities, and yet only 3% of their workforce is disabled, there may be biases resulting in disabled candidates being overlooked due to their disability.
Yes this is US specific.

Here is what you should share with your loved one (and read yourself as well):

---

I think focusing on making healthy meal plans with foods you feel are safe would be a good first step. Maybe [exposure therapy](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/treatment/exposure-therapy) could help, so if you slowly introduced new foods similar foods you like until you were able to expand what you eat then over time you could get a pretty large collection of safe foods or maybe even come to realize that your anxiety was unfounded. I know that eating disorders are not easy to overcome, but it is possible.

It might be helpful to understand that for a large portion of ED sufferers weight actually has little to do about it. Caring about weight is more a symptom of the ED while the root cause is very often a feeling of lack of control over one's own life. That very well may apply to you as well. People often think either that they need control over something and weight is something easy to control or that they have no control and there's no way they can stop themselves from just doing whatever feels good. In either case the ED does lead to having less control over their own life since they spiral.

Regaining control is all about teaching yourself that whatever is keeping you from doing the things you want to are bogus. Like, someone with anorexia or bulimia might worry that eating normal-sized meals will make them gain a huge amount of weight. By continually eating normal-sized meals they might notice a bit of uncomfortable bloat for a few hours afterward, but then it goes away as their body processes the food and it's no longer taking up so much space inside of them. They might also notice that when they step on the scale their weight might not change so drastically over time. I do believe that it is important to slowly work up to such things though. If you go from hardly eating to eating a lot more than usual it will shock your systems and can cause additional issues to arise.

You might also find mindfulness to be helpful. Try looking up DBT. It's a type of therapy which utilizes mindfulness meditation as part of its process. Mindfulness can help you get to the root of your problems. When you understand why you feel the way that you do at the core of your problems it becomes easier to figure out how to solve your problems. If you do some introspection and find out where all of this anxiety comes from that will make it easier to fix it.

If you need to talk more with other ED sufferers you should check out r/EDAnonymous. The name derives from programs for issues like alcoholism. There are groups (which you have probably heard of) with names like Alcoholics Anonymous which offer community-oriented support by and for people struggling with the relevant issues. This subreddit has the same idea. Nobody is shamed for not getting better, but nobody is encouraged to get worse either. Recovery is celebrated. You can even just vent about how you feel open and honestly and mods won't delete your posts because that's what the group is there for. They also have a Discord server, but the server is a bit more lax since nobody is afraid of Discord shutting it down for being a little too real.
Thank you for replying. Can I ask why you say don‚Äôt?
Wow. Thank you so much for an incredibly thoughtful and articulate response. I will absolutely read these articles and find the ones I feel will best help my sister and niece in their situation. 

Like I said I have struggled with disordered eating, but it‚Äôs more mental than anything now. I‚Äôm not overly restrictive, balance is everything to me. I even had fast food for dinner last night, which was a scary thing to even consider for a long time. I still get guilt and anxiety regarding my eating and weight, but it doesn‚Äôt impact me nearly as much as it once did. 

That being said, I think it‚Äôs so difficult to try to help a young child with this as my experiences started in my teens, and in an effort to help her heal, I‚Äôm scared I could have the opposite effect or say the wrong things. I will be reading more to refresh my mind and try to be of help.

I won‚Äôt reach out over text, but next time I see my sister, likely in the next week, I will bring this concern to her. It hurts me to see this child filling a void with food. Thank you.
She‚Äôs not going to listen to you and will probably in spite cut you off from them. Obesity is something she can see day in day out and she still does nothing."
When should I put my application in for ESA and LHA?,0,BenefitsAdviceUK,"You can't apply for LHA, you would have to apply for UC which includes housing element. However, voluntarily leaving a job can get you sanctioned, so you'd need evidence that it was for medical reasons.

LHA (local housing allowance) is the amount set by council for properties which is paid via UC.

 The next part, I think to apply for ESA it's through the UC process which would be applying then waiting 5 weeks for a payment if no sanction.They used to saction something like 3 months for voluntary leaving your job/making yourself unemployed I don't know if they do the same length of time now
Thank you, but as I mentioned before - i was signed off with stress due to the job. And I'm spiralling back to how I was before I got signed off. Can you explain why I can't apply for LHA?
Thank you for explaining to me üòä"

I have a deaf parent. The most simple thing that people do is tap on her shoulder when it's her appointment because she won't hear them shouting.¬†
I tend to be present for as much as possible as it's pretty impossible to hear anything in the busy ward environment. As much written information as possible because even if she gets 'you need a blood transfusion' with gestures she won't be able to hear the indications or risks to fully consent. All this obviously takes time which we don't have the liberty of. Some staff have BSL. One thing i notice is that most people speaking to deaf people want to speak directly in their ears but they get so much more from lip reading and facial expressions so it isn't something I would do.¬†
I‚Äôve had a few deaf patients at work (I‚Äôm a anaesthetics clinic fellow). My trust can book BSL interpreters who come and translate for the patients.

Our local service is really good - the interpreters are nice and v happy to be present to support the patient. I‚Äôve had them stay late/arrange additional interpreters when it‚Äôs been a bit complex.
Language line tele-interpreting has video link to BSL interpreters (not great access OOH though)

Many A&E waiting rooms have buzzers

Many clinic waiting room set ups use a screen to show patient name when they are called
Thank you!"
PIP - change of circumstances or mandatory reconsideration ,0,BenefitsAdviceUK,"There's been a weird influx of questions related to hearing loss and mobility. The consensus is that it's incredibly difficult to score for mobility and deafness. I wouldn't risk enhanced DL and standard mobility without specialist face to face advice.
If it‚Äôs deteriorated then that‚Äôs a change of circumstance. If you believe the initial decision was wrong and he should have got enhanced based on his conditions at the time then it‚Äôs an MR.
Yes !  I wonder if there's been an article elsewhere.
It wouldn‚Äôt just be based on his deafness, it‚Äôd be based on his mental health. I wouldn‚Äôt entirely feel comfortable applying for it if it was just for his deafness as I do feel like what he has is too good to get, if you get me. However, he has significant mental health issues and I know that people are able to claim on this grounds. 

!thank you!
Thank you, that has helped me to understand a bit more about it! What I may recommend him to do though is to seek advices from a specialist professional."
