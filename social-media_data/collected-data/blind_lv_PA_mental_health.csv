>I'm not going to let him treat me like she treated him.

oof
>>‚ÄùWe‚Äôre siblings we should be united‚Äù

Shoulda thought that before your cheating wife convinced you otherwise
It's insane to me that he thought he could just show up at her house, unannounced, and be welcomed with open arms. After years of refusing to even so much as text her.
Don't you just love how he suddenly remembered siblings have to be united when he cut her off and didn't even bother to come for her wedding? Nah, he should maintain that energy.¬†"

Looks like his parents are POS as well as the husband himself. And for his gf being pregnant too, well good luck to her.
When she said he broke in and wasn't telling I thought he was going to try and kill her but lost his nerve. What that statistic about pregnant womens leading cause of death being their partner? 


I hope he just goes away and never bothers her or the baby.
He flipped the switch as soon as he felt he had her trapped because of the baby and sincerely thought that she wouldn't leave him because of it. He was so sure of it that he showed no remorse, dismissed her emotions, and downplayed his own actions. He was a bomb waiting to go off no matter what happened.
Sounds VERY much like something I have second hand experience with.¬† Turns out it was meth

I‚Äôm Filipino and yes this is set in the PH. I‚Äôm doubting this story because you can‚Äôt file an annulment in two days. You need a lawyer (and the process of retaining a lawyer can take a bit of time) and a psych evaluation of one of the parties (assuming the reason is psychological incapacity, the most common reason for annulment). Only then will you be able to file a petition to get an annulment.
My doubts begin to show when supposedly both sides explain their stories. Cause both sides have very similar writing style.
This is so Philippines. The drama might seem exaggerated, but we're hella dramatic, and yes everyone here is terminally online so I wouldn't be surprised if Sarah's cousin did stumble on the mom's post.

The bio dads a pos obviously but the mom really needs to step it up to protect her kid. How is she not going after child support and using the courts to protect and provide for her kid?
Does this girl ever get out of the house, except to go from one household to another? She goes to virtual school and is looking for an online job. She doesn't mention friends, just cousins. I feel sorry for her.

I keep telling myself I'm going to quit following this, but here I am...
I don't even care if it's fake at this point, I'm just here for the drama. If it is fake, I like the writing style, I feel like the clich√©s are handled well.

If it's real, then damn! My sympathy to OOP.
People kept commenting how this was like a Law & Order episode, but they‚Äôre wrong. This is basically a General Hospital story.
Any guesses as to what's next? 

Will Luke find out he's not the father to any of Amy's kids and try groveling back to OOP?

Will Amy and Luke attack each other, because they work better as affair partners and the divorce is making things too real for them?

Will Tom and Sophie now start a relationship, since they're no longer worried about being siblings?"

Ahhh. So she took the notes offered and realized the paternity test would have to be later in the season.   

Gotta say, didn‚Äôt expect her to break it open with a simple ‚Äúhe forgot to delete years of affair evidence‚Äù to back up her lack of any reason to suspect an affair except bad vibes and some similar colouring. 

She definitely missed the mark on a grown man going a night and almost an entire day of without coming back for his phone, but maybe she will come back with a ‚Äúhe was using his work phone while he was away and that is why he didn‚Äôt come back for his electronics until close to 3pm‚Äù.   Did he have to use an actual alarm clock to wake up in the morning at his parents‚Äô house?

Surely Cat knows there is proof of the affair by now and has shared it with her husband so her FIL still saying he isn‚Äôt sure doesn‚Äôt sit right‚Ä¶.. unless he is having sex with Amy (but not fathering children). Or maybe Amy is his daughter!!!  üòÆ

My guess is that she is curious about you now because she is struggling with his issues like you were and is thinking of leaving him and wants to see how you are doing without him.  Do not believe anything people post about their relationships on social media.

Isn't Instagram just the place where people try to paint the best possible version of their lives? It‚Äôs all smoke and mirrors. I‚Äôve been cheated on multiple times, so I completely get where you're coming from. That initial feeling of ""was I not good enough?"" creeps in, and you start to pick apart everything, wondering what you did wrong, or what you could've done to stop it.

Here‚Äôs the thing: You were good enough. You did nothing wrong. And no matter what you did or didn't do, you couldn‚Äôt have stopped that sack of shit from cheating.

People who cheat once, especially when they feel they have no real consequences, will cheat again. They repeat the pattern because they don‚Äôt value loyalty or respect. It‚Äôs about them, not you. You gave your best, you tried everything, and that says more about your character than anything Instagram-perfect they‚Äôre posting.
I bet he is telling her about you. It's eating up at her, the reproaches he makes comparing her to you. She probably wants to stick it to your face because she needs something, grasping at something to feel better about the situation. Block her, it's not worth it."

I definitely preferred roommates to my parents. And I don't have a bad relationship with my parents, but their house is a lot smaller than the one I was able to split with people my own age and not all roommates suck.

Did I do update right? Or should I edit my post for it? 

Update: Thank you for all the kind comments and suggestions. You are right, I should trust my husband in what he‚Äôs doing, and I will. But as some of you pointed out, her behavior is alarming, and she might need a mental health check. If this continues, she could harm both me, my husband, and herself in the process. I will ask him what he plans to do next after going NC. If he intends to go NC further, I want to suggest that he ask his relatives to check on her mental health. I don‚Äôt know if my MIL will agree, though.

But honestly, I hope it‚Äôs just her difficult behavior rather than a mental health issue, because even now, I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on her. I‚Äôve read some medical articles about mentally ill patients, and it‚Äôs very scary.
This sounds like an undiagnosed mental disorder. You can compassionately go low contact and suggest she seek help.


I would consider a 6 to 12 month ""time out"" and then reevaluate. Skip birthdays and holidays.¬†
So odd. Some weird twisted control issue maybe?

I'm trying to imagine the look on her face if you sport the eye patch next time you see her.
Follow your husband's lead and go NC, he knows best 

Also, this is definitely a mental illness issue but if her family knows it's untreatable and there's nothing anyone can do than trust them, they've been dealing with it a lot longer"

*Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level, and beat you with experience.* 

- Mark Twain, others
My people (Dine\`) have a saying: ""You cannot wake up a man who is pretending to sleep.""

I learned the hard way too. You can't really debate or whatever, because they aren't engaging honestly or with integrity. They are there specifically to make a show of arguing with you that they imagine their god will see and later praise them for. 

They are like a playground junior bully who fights you and then looks to see if the big bully was watching.

So, what you do is you is you meet them impassively on topics of belief: ""I understand that you hold certain beliefs. I am not interested in discussing them. I live my life based on evidence, and tangible observations I have made with my own senses.""

**And, if they escalate to threats (even far fetched ones like telling you to get raped by islam), you pretend like you think it's real.** 

You go to HR and say ""so and so threatened to have me raped"" 

And/Or you go to the police and you say ""my coworker has told me that I deserve to be raped. I don't feel safe. I would like to file a report, so that there is a record if things escalate. I believe I am being targeted for \[religion/autism/race - use only if applicable\]""

Khelif is a perfect example of how far JKR has gone to the dark side.

For those still in limbo about whether or not to have kids,258,collapse,"My 70yo father is baffled by this, and doesn't understand how even to talk about it. I can pick up the hints in various contexts to get enough of a sense that it is bothering him. Two healthy, stable adult children, and neither showing any interest in ""carrying on the family line."" But I've decided that if he won't ask it straight, I'm not going to offer any explanation.

He does, however, seem to be wrapping his head around how super fucked the future is.

Also, his girlfriend has 3 sons (in their 40s, bit older than me and my sister) who hardly ever talk to her. One won't arrange to let her visit the new grandchild. So shout out to the boomers who staked their whole lives on kids taking care of them.
 I really love nature and get so much peace from it. Having to watch more and more nature disapear as every inch of this planet gets converted to suit the needs of ever more humans has always been my reason to not have any.
If you want kids, adopt. There is no shortage of suffering orphans in need of a caring family. That's actually a form of harm reduction unlike birthing yet more humans into an overstressed planet.
I‚Äôm 48, and my husband is 50. Neither one of us had kids before we married, and  before we married (in 2010) we discussed the matter. Neither of us wanted kids. He got a vasectomy, we got married, and we‚Äôve been together for about 15 years now. 

Imma be honest: I don‚Äôt like kids, and neither does my husband. It never really went any deeper than that, and we have never once regretted it. 

And ever since we became collapse aware, we thank our lucky stars that we made that decision because, quite frankly, it would be downright cruel to bring a child into this world now. 

These arguments have been around a lot longer than many have even been aware of collapse. None of them have ever been good justifications for having kids. 

The first point you‚Äôve addressed is enough: ‚Äòthere has always been suffering‚Äô

YUP. How about not bring a kid into it? We used to get harassed for not having kids. We were accused of being ‚Äòselfish‚Äô‚Ä¶ but there is nothing more selfish than to know that life has always been full of suffering yet insisting to bring a child into it anyway.
I know very few good people.  Most are selfish, inept, incurious and irresponsible.  I come from a large family, and every single other member exhibits at least three of those traits.  How could I ever forgive myself for creating yet another of those cretins?

Case in point, just this weekend I lent a seemingly experienced family member a brand new chainsaw for a project, the project mainly being questionably useful deforestation, all the tools that go with it, lubricant, the instruction manual and a tool bag to carry all of it.  What I got back was several disassembled parts, no tools, no manual, and no bag.  It ""fell apart"" when they were using it, and apparently that is my fault.  In a more just world, the tree would have fallen on them."

Social work, specialising in safeguarding in mental health.

We spend hours in lecture halls learning about anti oppressive practice and then we bounce off into our jobs and continue using the language whilst we engage in the very oppression we're supposed to proudly oppose. 

A few years ago there was an article which included a few lines which sum up how the system works and which I have printed out and had on the wall over every desk I have worked from since:

>Another client has a meeting with social workers. Her children are on the child protection register due to domestic abuse perpetrated by their father. The social worker is reviewing the list of things their mum must do under the safety plan. There are 14 things on the list. The father, the reason we are all there, isn‚Äôt even required to turn up to the meeting.
Hospitalist. Almost 99.99% carers are women.
My side hustle works with the wedding industry. I have yet to meet a bride who‚Äôs future husband actually wants to be with her. It‚Äôs just one big party for him, usually all week, he doesn‚Äôt help prep for the wedding, so many brides get soooooo burnt out from everyone else‚Äôs bullshit including invasive and pushy in-laws. I haven‚Äôt met a ‚Äúbridezilla‚Äù yet. 
I‚Äôve also worked as a caregiver for both young and old. Sleep deprivation was always the number one type of abuse the men in the house used against women.

Dog sitting is the real golden goose,208,beermoney,"I can vouch for this, at least via Rover. We have a medium sized house with a large fenced yard in a smallish city. Maybe we just found the perfect market, but the demand seems to be bottomless. We've made $12-15 grand a year the past three years and it could be more if my wife would charge market rate (she's too nice). Sometimes it can feel like a second job if we overbook, but for the most part it's pretty passive income (aside from the poop duty, which is... voluminous). It's absolutely worth trying out if you like dogs.
Just a comment on the save for tax day tip. You should actually do estimated payments if you are making any appreciable money doing this. Saving money for tax day isn‚Äôt always gonna cut it for everyone.
No shit! I want to go out of town soon, but it cost an arm and a leg for someone to stop by for 30 min a day and make sure my Miss kitty is ok! :/
I do Rover & love it. Great side income & don‚Äôt have to leave my house.
As a retired professional pet sitter , please make sure you're paying for liability insurance that specifically includes ""care custody and control"" of the pet.  Rover does NOT offer insurance.  Their ""guarantee"" is crap. 

 If the dog gets out and hurts somebody, you are liable.  If the dog jumps on the front of your stove and starts a fire, your homeowner's insurance will probably not cover it because you were operating as a business.  If the dog eats your special gummies and ends up at the vet, you're liable. There are so many things that you don't think of until after it happens.  Those are all real claims I've seen.

The types of lawsuits in the US that are crazy! For example, one sitter was walking a dog and an old lady completely on the other side of the street got spooked by a dog jumping up.  The dog was on the leash and never left the person's side. The old lady stepped back and tripped and broke her hip. Insurance covered it.

Also any dog you have in your yard is considered an ""attractive nuisance"".  Google it if you're not familiar with it.

Oh and lastly, in many years it's illegal to take in any dogs for cash without a kennel license. So be sure you know local law.  Cities and suburbs are more often strict. Rural areas tend to have less restrictions.  But every area is different"
"For Everyone Going Through a Breakup, Read This",184,BreakUps,"Thank u . Some days are good some days are bad . But during those bad days like today , these message keeps me going .
It‚Äôs difficult when this person you loved was still behaving the same as always, and thus seemingly still deserving of your love, and then suddenly break up and show their true face. You can‚Äôt just switch off that desire to give them love and attention, and receive their love and attention, so suddenly. My ex had stopped loving me but pretended to for about a month. When we broke up she jumped to another guy immediately. I still hung around for a month, as I was not ready to let go yet, but I recently broke off all contact finally. It‚Äôs devastating to lose someone you‚Äôve known and loved for years in just one short month.
I'm 5 months out of a 7 year relationship, and it's been really hard. I still live with my ex too. Feels like I'll never find someone who loves me again. I wish he did. I am right where you were, like he's upset, lashing out at me and everything, but why can't we just live in peace and harmony? I was so stupid to think that that could just happen. I'm not ready to let go, and I know that. It's been super hard for me.¬†

what do i do HELPPPP i always forget the bad things/bad qualities about them and try to understand and love them and forgive them
Thank you for this. I'm 2 months out of a 4 year relationship where I was the one loving enough for both of us. The quote you shared really resonates because I begged for less than the bare minimum and only received abuse. That forced relationship didn't last. I'm realizing now that this person never cared for or loved me at all. I was convenient to him. Although that hurts quite a bit, I now know I deserve so much more. I deserve to be built up, not broken down. The more I look back at everything, the more I realize how horrible he really was, and now I was spared when he broke up with me. Knowing now who he truly is, I can move forward without regrets. I tried my best and all the issues lie with him. 

I'm also moving next week! I've been staying in the house we bought together (he moved out because he got with the girl he cheated on me with and couldn't bring her to our house with me there). It's exciting and terrifying but it's a huge step forward for me."

New cover letter just dropped
So when we burning them?
My man, this is definitely TL:DR.
Industry response: TLDR"
I (32m) have really enjoyed not being with my wife (35f) and I feel terrible about it.,133,relationships,"Has she always stressed about money? $160k income with no kids should be pretty comfortable unless you're living in a very high cost-of-living city.

She needs to learn skills for how to cope with life stressors.  Whether that's through a therapist, self-help, etc.
I understand how hard it is to be around someone suffering from anxiety that way. I would recommend couple's counseling and also that she needs to deal with her anxiety in a way that works for her, hopefully she would be open to therapy. It's okay to set boundaries and say no to when she's taking out her stress on you. Sometimes people are in denial about their behaviours and it takes repeated pointing out for them to see that they are in fact, behaving in unfair ways. Take care of yourself, and I wish you both the best.
She needs to deal with her massive anxiety issues- it must be exhausting to exist in a constant state of panic and stress about things that aren't actually problems. It's also kind of insulting to hear your salaries and know that she is still constantly complaining about money and stressing out- so many people including myself make so much less than her and have actual real things to stress about! But anyway, if she won't deal with this in therapy/ with medication and by taking it seriously, then you should seriously consider leaving. People have to treat their own mental health issues, so there's nothing you can do in this situation.
Right now, you're lighting yourself on fire, just to keep her warm.

She's not doing any work to change this.

If I were you, I'd be planning my exit from this relationship.
This is crazy bc I had almost the exact same thing. She (kind, funny, gorgeous, all the things) would turn absolutely everything into an ordeal, far beyond anxiety into Truman Show territory. Things that happen around us always seemed to happen to her. And when she took a vacation, I noticed I suddenly felt much more relaxed. Similar to your situation, we didn't fight or argue. It was the World vs Her.


A small example. We have a two-way stop (east/west doesn't stop, north/south does) in our neighborhood. Most people think it's a four-way stop because there's a roundabout. I usually drove, but one day she decided to. The opposing car (no stop) stopped at the roundabout and my gf SCREAMED at her, at the top of her lungs. I said ""just wait, she's dumb, drivers here are dumb.""


This resulted in accusations of me ""taking her (other driver's) side"" and ended up ruining whatever we were doing. This was a five second interaction that ended up setting the tone for the rest of the weekend.


Adopts animals, then freaks out because there's hair everywhere. Asks for busy shifts then comes home saying she hates people and wants to quit her job. Etc. If I suggest something basic or logical, usually ""slow down and know your limits, you're human,"" I am just like everyone else. So the option is to either play into her stress, or stand by helpless.


Your gf getting therapy could save your relationship, as others have suggested. Don't feel guilty. You're not supposed to be in panic mode all the time.


I broke things off with mine after the last straw, it was something small like calling me dumb for not reading her mind, but it was the 100000th cut. She thought therapy was a scam.


Bumped into her a bit ago and it's baffling how well we get along now that I'm not her bf (we're not hooking up, just being small town civil). People like this tend to be codependent, to the point that they make independent people feel guilty for not participating.¬†"
I‚Äôve been single for five years and genuinely feel like I‚Äôve been hit with extraordinary bad luck for no reason? ,121,AskWomenOver30,"I‚Äôm just going to float a controversial opinion here:

The reason women are struggling with dating so much is because men have not progressed at the same rate as us. Think about it: for generations, we‚Äôve had to marry to just ‚Äúget by‚Äù in life. It wasn‚Äôt so long ago that we couldn‚Äôt work, vote, choose our life etc etc. Even in our parents and grandparents generations the norm was to quickly marry out of high school and start popping out kids - sure there are outliers who chose to also have a career or travel but they‚Äôre far less common than they are now. Throughout all of this, we‚Äôve had to be the emotional caretaker of our relationships - remember this, it‚Äôs important. It‚Äôs our ‚Äújob‚Äù to ‚Äútake care‚Äù of the man and the house and our well-being and appearance. 

Cut to present: really over the last two generations we‚Äôve seen a complete shift in the way women are choosing to live. More of us than ever are choosing a childfree life, choosing a career, choosing to travel. We can have all those things now without being ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù. Women have had to build strength and independence rapidly to adapt and enjoy all these freedoms we can now have without judgement. But we still have the emotional and mental strength of earlier generations imparted in us. Essentially what that means is we now have several generations of women who are mentally and emotionally strong, smart, driven, independent, and able to make their own choices in life. 

On the flip side, men have been sort of blindsided with this development and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear to me that they don‚Äôt know how/are unable to adapt to this new generation of women. The overwhelming majority of men still have ingrained patriarchal views, lack of emotional intelligence (because they‚Äôve been raised to expect a woman to take care of them), a hugely problematic tendency to sexualise and objectify us, and an overall total lack of ability to relate to and celebrate the monumental shift women have been able to achieve in recent generations. I think many quietly hate that we no longer ‚Äúneed‚Äù them. 

*I do have to make the obligatory ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù statement as there are plenty out there who love the fact that it‚Äôs a new world for us and we are considerably less oppressed. I also have to include ‚Äúnot all women‚Äù as sadly there are so many countries/cultures where we are still denied freedom and basic rights. I‚Äôm generalising here*

Overall, I find it rare to meet men where there are not issues with boundaries, consent, objectification, and the expectation of emotional caretaking. 

I can only hope that in time, men finally start to understand that the old ways of relating to women are not acceptable anymore. When they fully embrace a more equal mindset towards relationships then I believe we will have an easier time in dating.
Are you are me üòÇ 34 and have not had any type of relationship last for more than a few months over the past 4.5 years. It feels like one big cosmic joke sometimes. I have my sh*t together financially, physically and my mental health is pretty great recently. 

Everyday I‚Äôm actively working on bettering myself in some way. I‚Äôve done online dating but quit at the start of this year and have been focusing on real life meetups. I‚Äôm at the gym five days week. I taught myself to cook good, healthy food. I spend time with my friends and family. I‚Äôve joined a meetup group. I‚Äôve taken up more hobbies. I‚Äôve said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to social gatherings I‚Äôd usually blow off etc. the list goes on. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt get interest from guys but the ones who do show interest seemingly have heaps of issues they need to sort out (mental health, financial stuff, kids with exes). 

It almost feels like the more I work on myself/improve my life the more glaringly obvious it is that so many haven‚Äôt done that same work. It‚Äôs exhausting. I know nobody‚Äôs perfect but wow do some people choose not to work on bettering themselves. 

I don‚Äôt have any advice other than I FEEL YOU. Tbh I think a lot of dating and finding that one person is pure luck and circumstance.
I read this on the happy and single subreddit, but someone said ""dating is not a reward."" And it's SO true.¬†


Like truly you can max out every aspect of your life, and there won't be some golden man waiting there as a trophy for you. People find their partners at many random points in their lives. Broken unhealthy people can find relationships. I used to think like you and I would beat myself up over what I was ""doing wrong"". But sometimes the answer is literally - nothing. Luck and timing attributes to 99% of the process. Just keep on enjoying your life in the mean time!
My theory is that with each life improvement you make, you are setting yourself up for disappointment when you meet a person who has not taken the steps to actually improve their lives.  I have definitely been on the receiving end of interested people and dates, but I would turn them around because they were not the right person.  Is it bad luck or are you just more selective?  And do you really want to lower your standards?
Sounds like you live somewhere that you're not a good fit for. The biggest game changer I ever experienced was moving to a city where I fit in really well. I would absolutely recommend that to anyone in your situation."

"A brief Lore summary of Hoolay and Feixiao, as well as some CN discussions about the implications of 2.5 story",114,HonkaiStarRail,"I agree with the conclusion of Feixiao not being a emanator. When it comes to discussing the generals being emanators, the best assumption is that the sprits given to them are the emanators and need a host to weld them.
When they call her the ""Merlin's Claw,"" is that a reference to the wizard or the bird of prey?
This lore gives so many parallels to Dan Shu, who in a way is relatable to feixiao. Both are cursed with something that's uncurable, both are/ were well respective in their field, and both lost a dear friend to Lan and his Lux arrow.

You can also say she is similar to Jiaoqui, who are both healers who have become dillusional over lan's war against the abominations of the abundance, and have to deal with a permanent disability.

The difference between the three could be how they approached loss from war. jiaoqui is always questioning it whenever he had to deal with saving lives but chooses to continue pursuing the healing arts, feixiao chooses to continue fighting to find the possible peace. Dan Shu however chose to fight Lan and follow the sanctus medicus as she believed she has lost too much of everything. 

This storyline feels like a spiritual successor to the Dan Shu plot by giving examples of characters who have been dealt the same way she did. In another way this storyline may have subtley fleshed out Dan Shu's motivations and desires as well through letting us see the perspectives of feixiao and jiaoqui.

You are not the asshole for wanting to stay no contact; it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and boundaries, especially after being hurt by her previous behavior.

I Feel Extremely Guilty,72,NDE,"It seems you are ready to forgive your father for what he did wrong, due to his upbringing and yet you can't do the same for yourself?

Show yourself the same empathy.

From what I have read in NDE stories, everything is as it should be and your father knows this now and has long since forgiven you and himself.
Talk to him like he's there with you. He might hear you or be brought the message. 

When my mom had bone cancer and I had to take care of her I blew up at her, too. Except I didn't feel really bad afterward about what I said because what I said needed to be said.

The fact that we are there taking care of them in their most vulnerable time shows we care. A lot of my mom's favorites ditched her for those 3 long years but me, the unwanted one, was there.
I believe he's right there. Listening. He knows.

I recommend you learn how to meditate.

Push away and quiet all the inner turmoil, cacophony and static. Then you can reach out and ask for yourself...
I have not had an NDE, so I can‚Äôt answer your questions about where your dad has gone, nor what he may or may not be doing. But as a fellow human who has made mistakes and hurt people, I want to say that your recognition of your own actions and the remorse that you feel speaks to the goodness that‚Äôs in you. Try to give yourself some grace, since you can see how difficult your circumstances were at the time you were taking care of your dad. And knowing he took such good care of you in his own time, I‚Äôm sure he would want you to be kind to yourself, the person he adored. Take care.
The only thing you can really do is try and learn a lesson from it so that you can avoid feeling that way again. Sometimes guilt can be a good teacher. Guilt and suffering may be unavoidable to a certain extent for many people. I don't think it's possible to fully appreciate someone while they're here. It's only in their absence that their true value is realized. We sometimes hurt the ones we love. We don't always act like we should. Guilt is a good thing, though... trust me. You're better off with it than without it in the end. To do whatever you want and feel no guilt... you couldn't possibly learn anything."

Chatgpt summarized your summary, prompted to maximize brevity in point-form:

- Warren Buffett‚Äôs early business acumen was evident from selling gum at age 6.
- Influenced by his father, Howard Buffett, he valued honesty, diligence, and independent thinking.
- Educated by Benjamin Graham, Buffett adopted value investing: focus on intrinsic value, margin of safety, and long-term holding.
- Buffett‚Äôs unique strategy involved acquiring high-quality businesses and leveraging insurance company cash flows.
- Key investments: American Express, Coca-Cola‚Äîemphasized buying undervalued, quality companies for long-term growth.
- Despite wealth, Buffett leads a simple life, valuing meaningful work, relationships, health, and continuous learning.
- Core philosophy: self-investment, integrity, optimism, and long-term thinking drive true success.
If there ever was a post that needed a TL;DR‚Ä¶.
I like Buffett but he didn‚Äôt sell gum because of any keen business sense. People bought because they knew who his family was.

You‚Äôve articulated your story extremely well. Thank you so much for taking the time to describe in detail what you have gone through. So many others will relate. 

 I completely agree with your experience of being stuck in it! How you intuitively know that something is terribly off and wrong with your body and it becomes all consuming and you dwell on it every day, fearing the worst. That fear and mental torment is real and unforgiving. 

That happened to me, which is why my entire Reddit activity for the past 2 years has been nothing but PSSD/PFS/Hard Flaccid. And despite experiencing all these negative symptoms the pathology hides itself within normal lab work, abandoning us to the mystification of the iatrogenic condition that this disease is.

I had and still have anhedonia, muscle weakness, twitching, cognitive decline, dry skin, dry eyes, gut issues, skin changes, sexual changes. You‚Äôve described it well.

I also didn‚Äôt sweat for the first 5-6 months, this has come back though and I can sweat again. But yeah even my girlfriend noticed that I didn‚Äôt sweat, it was bizarre and a sign something was/is really really wrong."
"Sharing my feminist list of games, that the community might find useful üòä",56,GirlGamers,"I don't understand why Hades is neutral but, for example, papers please is not neutral as well
To each their own, but this list doesn't make sense to me. A game can be 'not feminist' due to situations outside of the game's control (such as having a sexist dev or CEO), but to be considered 'feminist' it has to exclusively deal with what OP considers to be 'feminist topics'. That's double standards. Also, I don't think something is or isn't feminist purely based on whether it handles topics of womanhood very specifically. 

What about female creations, or in Hades' case, art specifically drawn by women, in a story where LGBTQ+ themes are strong and respectful. By this logic, a show like Arcane cannot be feminist because the studio that made it or the community that plays the game is full of degenerates. I also think deciding that Bayonetta is decidedly not feminist, when its main character is a strong and independent woman with her own agency, motivations and sexual expression, but papers please be neutral is...a take for sure. This links back into my earlier point too. If Bayonetta cannot be feminist because according to you she's been designed with the 'male gaze' in mind, then why is Hades not feminist for having been designed by women to be sexy for a more feminine audience? What are we supposing feminism means here?
That's a LOT of work y'all have done and I'm surprised you didn't run out of space! 

However I would consider embedding the list of games as an image. As that's a lot of lines / hard work just to get messed up by Reddit's poor formatting system.
Wait how is Elden Ring not at least neutral? If Bloodborne is, I assume the management isn't an issue. 

It has a bunch of female characters who are as powerful as male characters, central to story lines, and gender neutral outfits that don't change much by body type for player characters. I was so happy with the game and the ability to wear full coverage armour. You can wear clothes collected from beings of any gender.

There are a lot of female characters, Melina, Roderika, Latenna, Ranni, Malenia, Marika, Cleanrot knights, Blackknife assassins, Millicent, Nepheli, Fia, Hyetta, Irina, the crones etc. plus even more with the extra content now. I'd say at least 50/50 representation. 

All the characters have distinct motivations, and abilities, as well as styles of dress, there's even disability representation. Multiple characters with prosthesis for example, and characters who are blind but still independent. It plays into the world building, but like Malenia's prosthesis are really detailed, effort was clearly put into design. I don't think they're stereotypical since some are ""villains"", and others are not. They exist on a spectrum of identities.

There isn't a traditional romancing aspect to the game, but female characters can choose the Ranni ending which involves sort of being her partner. Characters gender doesn't explicitly change anything in the story. 

There are a lot of themes that tie into social issues. Complex political situations, wars, family, racism. It's just in a fantasy setting, but you can see commonalities with real world issues like the Holocaust, and general themes of discrimination. 

It's a very good game, and I found the community was good too.

Edit to add: 

You have the option to help stop a man who is perpetrating harm against women and men in the game. To not do so would be seen clearly as a negative. There are pretty clear moral ""dilemmas"" raised in the game. You're made to feel bad if you choose bad options.
as much as i love the effort in this. its way too hard to read :("
"Tania Needs Mental Help, Would Help PETA & Chimps ",55,ChimpCrazyHBO,"She‚Äôs has to want it and she does not think there is anything wrong with her. Maybe after all this, light will be shed but so far, she‚Äôs doubling down.

As I‚Äôve said in another post, I strongly believe she has borderline personality disorder. That doesn‚Äôt just go away with a little therapy. It is highly treatable when the client is motivated. 

It‚Äôs a fascinating case study for sure as many of these women have very similar personality traits.
> Tania and the other chimp ladies treated their chimps like kids

I sure hope they don‚Äôt lock their kids in basements, keep them drugged on Xanax, or make them wear shock collars. 

Anyone rich enough to afford a chimp can afford mental health care. Sandy (Travis‚Äôs owner) was a millionaire. There‚Äôs only so much that can be done for people who refuse to get help. PETA‚Äôs approach- suing neglectful owners and lobbying for a ban on private chimp ownership- is a much more effective use of their resources.
People with kids in cults also think they are doing the right thing but it isn‚Äôt true. There‚Äôs lots of situations where people believe they are morally correct when doing unethical things.
I don't buy the Tonia means well narrative. She's an exotic animal broker. She loves the money the animals bring and doesn't care about the about their well-being. She wanted Tonka bc she wanted to have access to at least 1 chimp for selfish reasons- breading, as an attraction at her zoo, just to spite Peta, to sell him later. I don't think she even really liked him that much- after all she hasn't even tried to visit him. She's faking her love him the way she faked being sad that he ""died"".
Tania reminds me a lot of my mother. She wouldn‚Äôt do therapy if it was offered."

Well said. I'd like to add to the environmental aspect. Notice while Democrats and Europe in general push for more public transportation, less private transportation, and less public flights; they just happen to exclude themselves from these rules. Really seems to give ""rules for thee, but not for me"" and ""You will own nothing and be happy"" vibes while using environmental ""concerns"" as an excuse.
You see the left were very smart. I feel for it at first too but when looking back I found a pattern.

The thing is the slippery slope is real and the left has mastered it. They start off with small things that everyone can agree on that have an emotional appeal. Once it becomes mainstream accepted they start the process of using it as a wedge to divide the political opponents from those they want to control. They do it slowly with things that make sense and have emotional appeal. Then they ramp up making opponents into something truly evil overtime while holding themselves up as the saviors and hero's. While they are doing that they add in little things that people don't always agree with but the small steps make people not question it because they don't want to be part of the evil side. Eventually, they push it so far people are agreeing with and pushing for things they would never agree with:

Examples - Clinton on abortion: safe, legal, and, rare. The majority agree in extremely rare cases (rape, incest, life of mother) it should be accepted and that it should be as safe as possible. Safe, legal, and rare became safe, legal, and limited. The right raised flags saying they are moving the goal posts, the left says they are trying to force rape victims to carry babies. Then safe, legal, and limited became safe, legal, and choice. The left started removing the limitation to abortion and again the right raised flags. The right was alienated as hands maid tale and those that started to question it was now anti-choice. Now it's safe and a right... creating laws to allow for abortion up to birth and some on the left even arguing post birth and if you don't agree you are after women's bodies and fascists.

You can do the same with climate change, the alphabet mafia, free speech, and illegal immigration. It's a tried and true technic that takes decades to enact but have tricked many into believing they are the morally good, which allows them to commit acts just years previously they would find horrendous. The worst part is they use your own sense of right and wrong to do it with via emotional manipulation.
Their proposed climate change policies are abysmal too. Eat less meat, no flying or private transportation, carbon footprint tracking, etc. They‚Äôre using climate change as an excuse to enslave us."
Feeling overwhelmed but I need to find a way to jump into action!,51,MakeupRehab,"I think you've already started working on the most important aspect: identifying the reason your shopping went beyond what you're comfortable with, and actively addressing that reason. For that alone, I applaud you!!!

There is no rule that says you have to declutter. If you're not ready to, that's ok. With the work you're putting in, you might find yourself more able to let things go a little later down the line. It's great that you have an awareness that you'll never be able to get through it all. Enjoy your makeup in whatever capacity you choose to, and I hope you can continue to find fulfilment and creativity in the hobby of using, rather than buying, makeup. Best of luck!
I‚Äôm very sorry to hear how hard of a time you‚Äôve been having. I really hope you and your family are doing better and continue to do so!

As for advice, I have a couple suggestions:

1. Try making it exciting to do your makeup daily by:
- making it into a game: randomly/blindly choose different products each day and challenge yourself to combine them into a cohesive look
- try some YouTube makeup challenges or have your friends choose your makeup for the day 
- you seem to have a lot of lip products, maybe you can put them in a box and reach in and grab one at random. That can be your daily lip product. 

2. This one is less ‚Äúproductive‚Äù but can possibly help with your overwhelming anxiety and guilt:
- store away your products and only have a small collection of essentials for a month. (This is hard, but in the end will help you realize that you don‚Äôt need a lot of products and will help prevent you from relapsing, trust me I‚Äôve been there) out of sight out of mind 
- you can rotate products each month (maybe a month can have a theme or something) 
- it‚Äôs kind of like shopping your collection. At the end of each month you‚Äôll be able to go back to your collection and choose new products for the next month. 

3. Finally, I understand how difficult it is to get rid of products. I find that when I‚Äôm decluttering I want to keep everything because I consider it all special. You can take away that specialness by simplifying the product:
- it‚Äôs a blush. You most likely have another product that looks and works the same. You don‚Äôt need multiple of one product. In fact most blushes end up looking the same, there‚Äôs only so much our skin and undertones can do
- as for eyeshadow, ask yourself what colors you actually like and which ones are you forcing yourself to like. 
- In general, if you have even the slightest doubt of a product, get rid of it! You should only keep what you love and makes you happy! Imagine you‚Äôre going to marry that product lol! Don‚Äôt have doubts! 
- I find it easier to donate products to family and friends. It sits easier with me knowing that it‚Äôs going to a good place and can make someone else happy instead of just going to the trash. 
- I think Sephora has a somewhat lenient return policy. Maybe you could return some of the unused products?

Please please don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. You are human and deserve to have peace in your life. ü§ç
I think you are on the right path, don't be too hard on yourself. Makeup is something you love, don't make it stressful by worrying about the size of your collection. It's great that you've recognised the issue, now you can work on it. But be gentle with yourself and don't beat yourself up about it. You can change your attitude now and work on your mental health, but don't be so harsh.
I think that if you aren‚Äôt ready to commit to downsizing, that‚Äôs okay! But something I would say is that it might be better for you to try and get away from the mindset of ‚ÄúWell this caught my eye for a reason.‚Äù You know the reason. You were coping with a difficult period of your life by trying to get a dopamine hit from shopping. Now, maybe there are some things you genuinely were into and that you would want to use, but I know from my own experiences treating shopping in a very similar way, a lot of the things that I was drawn to, I wanted because I envisioned a version of me who owned that product and felt differently than I felt in my own reality. 

Instead of trying to decide if you‚Äôre going to get rid of a ton of stuff or try to test it all out, for now, maybe just try to use stuff that appeals to you when it appeals to you. Maybe pick out a handful of products from each category- some that you have tried and like and some that are new, and box up the rest. Shop your collection and rotate things out when you feel bored or you feel the impulse to shop. Maybe twice a year go through the unused stuff and decide if there are any things you‚Äôre absolutely not going to use and then go through the stuff you‚Äôve tried out and decide if there are things that need another try or if you would be better off without.
A lot of us relate fully to this, including myself. Before my first massive declutter last year where I threw out literally 2 medium sized cardboard boxes full of my expired 2015-2018 makeup, my collection was similar to yours. I think a lot of factors contribute to it - one major one being influencers calling it a makeup ‚Äúcollection‚Äù. The way that term is now used by the beauty community makes it look exciting and normal for makeup lovers to own drawers and drawers of products. You start feeling compelled to take advantage of every big sale. You feel fomo if you don‚Äôt own whatever viral thing every other girl is obsessed with at the moment. Curating the ‚Äúcollection‚Äù becomes the real hobby. It usually take a few years until we start seeing it in a different light - overconsumption of hundreds of tiny products that will take motivation and time weekly to apply, organize and sanitize until empty, broken or expired. 

As a former Sephora employee who had a massive collection after working there, a big way I downsize my backup stash of unopened product without feeling guilty is filling the unused cosmetic bags I accumulated (from brand events or as free gifts with purchase) with a whole face routine of full sized products to give as gifts for family and friends for holidays and birthdays. Like a full size mascara, eyeliner, loose powder, blush, bronzer, highlighter, eyeshadow or palette, and a lipstick. My SIL and mom especially love it and it makes me feel so good to know the products are being enjoyed by my loved ones instead of rotting for years in a spare drawer until I get around to opening them. That‚Äôs totally an option though and don‚Äôt feel guilty if you want to keep and enjoy most of your products for you. Every piece we own is special to us for some reason so only give away the things you like but you know you can live without."
The Curse of Grief,49,nosleep,
A car centric society is really ablest ,50,fuckcars,"Almost half of all disabled people cannot drive, including me! An autistic woman whose visual processing isn‚Äôt fast enough. Until age 27 I had to either beg my parents for rides or use horrifically unreliable disability paratransit. And since paratransit completely books up within seconds due to how much demand there is for it I was mostly begging my parents. Everyone made it clear they did not think I was a real adult despite my having a Masters degree and being able to take care of myself in every other aspect of life.

Then the inevitable happened. My dad developed neurological problems and lost his ability to drive. My mom simply did not have time in the day to chauffeur both of us while also filling her own needs. I was forced to move to a walkable urban neighborhood with usable transit. My parents spent most of their lives believing that even setting foot in my current neighborhood would lead to you getting shot and killed. But at this point, we realized we had no choice. Thankfully my parents now realize they were being prejudiced, but I still need to fight tooth and nail for my city bus system to keep the funding it needs to remain operational. Because in a year or two, my mom‚Äôs eyesight will have declined to the point that she can‚Äôt drive anymore either.
This is what makes the ""somebody think of the disabled!"" 'argument' from carbrains so infuriating.
I don't disagree with you. But the people who want to completely eliminate cars and make everyone take public transportation are also ableists. For example, my anxiety and panic disorder make it so I can't take public transportation without thinking I'm going to have a heart attack. So, there has to be a happy medium between these two options.
So just because a small minority can‚Äôt drive, (a lot of disabled people can drive too) it means we have to restructure our whole society so non-disabled people have to depend on uncomfortable and unreliable public transport, making journeys longer for them simply because they live in a society that has to march to the beat of the slowest drum?
Exactly!"

It's all about power and nothing about your sister's actual wellbeing. She needs to have the humility to see her own failing but that seems too threatening for her. 

You're being parentified too, just through their incompetence and out of your own compassion to not let your sister go through the same. You're doing a lot, it's not an easy position to be in. I don't think you can fully protect her either.

You're doing your best. I think it was a good call and mature to not let it escalate more. Be sure to be there for your sister after such an upsetting event and process it together. She needs to know you are an ally for her inside the home. If she can know you're a safe person for her to go to, and that you care about her and support her, I think the damage of growing up in such a home will be lessened.
Your mom's words are super hurtful and reflect how much fear and shame she carries.¬†


Unfortunately, I don't think you can protect her. It's just not in our ability to shield minors from their parents. The best you can do is to build a good 1:1 relationship with her. Life is long and you two can still be friends long after your mother is not in the picture anymore.


I am hoping the best for both you and your sister. üôè
>I‚Äôve created this big traumatic memory for her when she‚Äôs seen for the first time how scary both my mum and dad can be. Which is exactly what I was trying to protect her from.


Hey now, take a deep breath. You did the right thing, you didn't escalate the situation and your sister knows you are a safe person to be vulnerable with. You didn't create any kind of traumatic memory - that was your parents. You were acting as a life raft for her to hold on during the storm, and showing your sister she's not insane, your mum's behaviour is not normal.¬†


Maybe come up with a couple of safe words between the two of you, one neutral that you can use in public that gives verbal support (like a cute nickname), and another in case of emergency, that if she needs you, to use the phrase.


Knowing there's someone who has your back is a big gift, that I'm sorry you didn't have. If you haven't read it/audiobook Adult Children Of Emotionally Immature Parents, I really recommend it. It will help you in dealing with them going forward. Best of luck to you both OP üñ§
Your mother is also reliving her trauma, apparently. I don't have any sympathy for her. Just pointing it out.¬†

Get out. Get out as soon as you can. Abusers who get away with it have a tendency to escalate.¬†
Taking care of yourself is always the best option
Pack whatever is most precious to you in secret.. then go back to your parents and tell them your in possible danger and you will get your own place as soon as possible. If they can't help find an old friend who can.

Get out while you can. Anyone who says they can't control their own behavior is an abuser.
He is emotionally manipulating you/gaslighting you- yeah, get out and go home or move back to live with a friend.

For those still in limbo about whether or not to have kids,42,childfree,"Petty reason: you can't eat anything in front of them without them noticing. Not even a piece of broccoli. It'll be ""Mom, can I have one?"" And then, ""But I WANT one!"" Cue meltdown if mom says no. Every kid I've met does this.
This was incredibly well written and thought out. I agree with pretty much everything you said. Each reason was very concise and had a fair answer to them. I also like that you aimed for getting diverse opinions and reasons from non childfree people to help make your points. I honestly haven't even heard a few of the points you have made and it's given me even more reasons to stay childfree. This whole post was super informative!¬†


I hope you enjoy your childfreedom with the rest of us here, and thank you for the educational read! ‚òÜ

What does someone like Rust Cohle need more than anything? Was there ever a middle path for him?,39,TrueDetective,"I don't have an answer for you, but I certainly appreciated hearing your thoughts about one of my favorite written and portrayed characters in TV.
I think textbook pessimism as a lived philosophy is kinda of fundamentally inhuman, and very hard to hold onto without becoming a hermit
I can only respond in the vein of realism because the show really is a masterclass in that.

TLDR: The guy needed to get help (some form of grief therapy) when his daughter died. He needed some form of trauma therapy (not just a stay at a psychiatrist facility for a few months) after he was done working YEARS undercover in insane circumstances. He had a substance problem that he was NOT succeeding to regulate (as was Marty), and had an insomnia problem that he sought to treat by purchasing street drugs from a hooker - NOT going to a doctor for help (I mean why the fuck would anyone do that). And he never got ANY help for his hallucinations? All of that and not mentioning his childhood (raised in remote circumstances to a survivalist kook in Alaska without access to television or his mother?).

Look at these things this way, and frankly I'd be with Gilbough and Papania. Dude's a great suspect, especially when you see him getting hammered in the middle of the day (pilot script and treatment originally having this be a ruse to pretend to be impaired mentally) and admits he doesn't sleep and hallucinates. I mean jfc, guy's a wreck.

Longer version: neglected in childhood, faces the loss of his daughter and his wife, gets no counseling, takes out his rage at work (working the local drug circuit to death til they were in hotel rooms busting people for very small amounts of cocaine, then murders a junkie on the job), then becomes a wild undercover agent for years in high-stress and drug-fueled environments before becoming a detective at the start of E1.

Someone with that background needs so much help that the last time I watched TDS1 (my favorite ""filmed thing"" EVER) I had to actually shelve it when I was done -- to face that many things and just try to champ them all without any professional help and then wear a gun on your hip ever day is insanely negligent. I realized how much I really idolized the character for the machismo.

His philosophies kept him isolated, and his contempt for other people only serves to cast himself as better and/or smarter (conscious or not) of whoever he's talking about. He's ironically more self-righteous than others, though he never says it, deflecting by saying things like ""everyone is no one"" - kind of a massive difference from saying something healthy like ""I'm not better than anyone - everyone is equal.""

The show is great, but Rust became a hell of a lot less likable to me as I got older. On the other side of that, yeah I kinda get annoyed with the tough guy attitude.

So, middlepath? Fuck yeah. If he would've gotten help with like 1 or 2 of those things he wouldn't be the same level of edgelord and wouldn't have had the same difficulty keeping a job, making friends, currying favor, and possibly pursuing the central case with more legitimacy. But this isn't just a show about the case - it's a show about the 2 guys and their lives, and the case, too.

(sorry for deflecting all the philosophies - I just think most of all that stuff was bullshit fodder to meet his own ends of staying on his own)

EDIT: I forgot to mention at the top that he fuckin hallucinates because of all the drugs and stress he endured, lmao
My personal take is that pessimism is a cold and miserable philosophy and, in a traumatic near-death situation like Rust faced in the end, he desperately needed some kind of human warmth, even if it is bullshit. Basically almost dying broke down all his coping mechanisms and all the walls he had built around himself and forced him to connect with humanity because deep down we're all terrified of being alone. It's like the ""no atheists in a foxhole"" type thing, not that god is real but humans actually terrified for their lives are gonna grab anything comforting they can.
He was abandoned and neglected by his parents and had his daughter torn away from him and his marriage disintegrate. His boo-sucks-to-life philosophy is a means of protecting himself. He needs to accept his daughter's death was a bad thing, and to grieve it.

Philosophically, he needs to get with some sort of Pragmatism and stop chasing the Absolutist ether, and to reject his default to negativity.

""Come down off the cross, we can use the wood"" - Tom Waits.

What he really needs is what we all need - to work and to love. By 'work' I don't mean emplyment, I mean to feel useful. 

I think the shift at the end is because he accepts he was loved by his daughter and his father. He couldn't hold his defenses, and he accepted what he knew - what had driven him to reject life.

The final shot is of Rust finally, literally leaning on someone - Marty.
The middle ground is ‚Äúcuriosity.‚Äù 

The universe is absent of meaning. But as a member of our species, we need meaning to survive. Similar to how any living organism needs to find sustenance to survive, human beings NEED meaning. It is fundamental to our individual and collective survival. 

Now, that meaning can come from a cultural blueprint (like religion) or it can be established by the individual search. 

This ‚Äúsearch‚Äù for meaning is curiosity. It takes intellectual humility to recognize how little we know of the universe (only the ignorant live in certainty). But in that lack of certainty lives hope. And with hope, comes the search."
My (positive) diagnostic experience as an AFAB adult + short rant about people dismissing doctors' opinions,37,AutisticPeeps,"I am not a female, but thank you for sharing this. If this is meant for females, then I apologize for posting in response and will delete it. My psychologist did the exact same thing when she assessed me. She looked at how I perceived the world and how my interests were a strong part of who I am and how I light up and always bring the conversation either back to myself or back to that. 

Again, thank you. Trained professionals can see deeper than what most people can see. I was so skeptical myself and said it probably a dozen times or more over the course of our interviews of how I just didn't know if autism is even what I was dealing with and that I only had a suspicion.

Side note: She also said I had a ""unique and interesting"" way of perceiving the world.
Thank you for sharing your experience! I‚Äôm also a diagnosed AFAB adult, and the part about your doctor seeing how you perceive and interact with the world being different than others was something that happened to me, too.

I also wonder if some of the issues regarding misinterpreting doctors‚Äô dismissals is genuinely due to poor explanation by doctors. Like, what does ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt present as autistic‚Äù mean in that context? What hallmarks of their internal experience differ from autism? I think it might genuinely help at least some people if said doctors explained the actual differences they are seeing that don‚Äôt align with autism ‚Äî it might also help rule other diagnoses in that might genuinely be more beneficial to pursue.
Thank you for sharing! Fellow late-diagnosed, AFAB, ""high-masking"" here who also had a positive experience with getting diagnosed. :) 

I also share your confusion about female autism being *so* invisible that even well-trained professionals can't detect it... like??? Like you said, assuming these professionals specialise in and up to date with autism, then  I expect they can *still* can spot the subtle signs. Heck, throughout my entire life, *people always saw my symptoms*, but just never linked it to autism. Like just for the example,  even my first psychologist (who didn't specialise in autism or ADHD unfortunately) could tell that my mannerisms seemed robotic, forced... and they wanted to train me in social skills! üòÖ there's more examples but I shan't derail this haha.

 So the idea that someone can be SO good at masking that absolutely *no one* notices even a *single* symptoms is... suspicious Iol.
Thank you for sharing, even though I don‚Äôt relate to your story, I appreciated reading it and thank you for sharing.
i also had a positive experience with diagnosis as an afab (i identify and present as female). i really dislike this excuse as well. any assessor worth their salt **will** understand genuine masking etc. i had no idea i was autistic at all tbh and it came up whilst i was being assessed for adhd. i was really shaken by this and my point is that the majority of professionals do know what they‚Äôre doing & what to look for. hence why they pick things up. it‚Äôs so much more than a tick box exercise. i agree though it would be really good if professionals were able to try and explain this better, because otherwise people just get really mad they didn‚Äôt get diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder (?!?!), shit on the doctor/team, and go for a ‚Äúsecond opinion‚Äù. 

if you do have autism, regardless of presentation & afab/amab, with a good assessment it IS clockable. this especially weirds me out when people who have spent a lot of time on psych wards aren‚Äôt diagnosed but say they‚Äôre autistic. if you‚Äôre under medical supervision in hospital, where your behaviours etc are constantly watched and tracked, someone WILL pick up on it. i already had the diagnosis before going into hospital but the doctor who hadn‚Äôt read my notes yet wrote it was very obvious i had autism after meeting me & my parents (my dad is also autistic) for 15 mins. it does get spotted. don‚Äôt be scared to get an assessment if you‚Äôre afab/femme presenting !!!"

You're an ant fighting against someone with a magnifying glass on a bright sunny day. This exact scenario has been happening across the country and I have only heard of one time where the people got to stay with new conditions and it was a Airbnb. I have honestly unfortunately have not heard of anyone winning this kind a battle.


If it was me, the first thing I would do would be start looking for a lawyer to do a class action lawsuit for anything that can be a class action lawsuit or fighting for more time or fighting for relocation benefits. Contact the media.. all of them as many as you can. Start fighting by going to City Hall council meetings and get as many people as you can there to say what a hardship this would be, and it would create more homeless people. Legal or not legal? I'd stop paying rent. Save up as much money as possible. What are they going to do? evict you? They're already evicting you. 


I generally wish I had some better advice. But unfortunately in these times greed just keeps winning over and over and over

Most new players nowadays come to this subreddit and they're told to start with DST, which imo is a terrible way to start because it's not aimed at single players and it's strayed further and further from the original game's spirit.

It makes sense. Social skills are kind of the path to many things

>I guess that's the biggest plight of it all. You have been holding this secret world for so long, and you still have to keep it to yourself a long while longer. You finally understood, but that did not make everyone else's misunderstanding suddenly go away. Is it worse to be the only one to know the truth while everyone is still blind? Or would have I been happier never knowing at all.

Yeah... have ran it through my mind... should I tell people at work, my parents, family? It never turns out well. If I tell people online about Schizotypal disorder they either won't care to understand it or it'll make things worse. Learning about the disorder has made me feel kind of hopeless in regards to socializing or creating close bonds with others. I had hope before realizing the extent to which I'm different from others.

Still most people at work or irl are extraordinarily nice to me for some reason; or at least nicer than I'd expect. I'll pretend I'm autistic and never mention StPD outside of a therapy session

Has my weird mom actually been AuDHD the whole time? I got recently diagnosed with ADHD..,25,AuDHDWomen,"I could go on and on. But, the short answer (as it relates to my own mom) is‚Ä¶yes! Whenever I read people in this and similar subs describe some of these things about their parents and attribute them to narcissism (that‚Äôs just such a cultural touchpoint in the U.S. and in media), I drop a bomb that their parents are likely ND and it‚Äôs always met with silence. 

One‚Äôs own PERSONAL journey to diagnosis can be confusing and conflicting, so, it follows that seeing your parent through this lens might be too.

Not only can I relate to that moment of shock, BUT, I have specific things I can relate to in your story: my mom is a great singer and would regularly, without fail, sing more loudly than the choir in church. Like, ZERO social awareness. She also overshares SO SO much. I ALSO realize my mom likely has echolalia. It has been a tailspin to have the moment of recognition, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs true. Shrug.

For me, there‚Äôs not much I can do. Years and years of this intertwined relationship that has the potential for strain in solid, NT relationships has exhausted me. I know more and it helps me give her some grace. And that‚Äôs about it.

Could chat about how I put the pieces together in my own life, if you‚Äôre open to it!

Diagnosis is a lot to process, so it‚Äôs no wonder you‚Äôre thinking about what it means for yourself, and perhaps the places you inherited it from! Your mum could be experiencing neurodivergence too. Have you spoken to her about it? 

I think I remember a post a while back on the ADHDwomen Reddit where someone asked the group how many of them had a narcissistic parent, and there was quite a high response. 

I have also read Janette McCurdy‚Äôs ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Glad My Mom Died‚Äô - which was brilliant, and a little bit like you - it really resonated with me and my own upbringing! I have recently been doing some reading into the links between neurodivergence and being raised by narcissistic parents, and I have found it really helpful in understanding my own behaviour, and how I was raised.
Reading this in fear because my current obsession is trying not to fuck up my kids so they end up hating me, while probably doing just that. If any of you have answers for OP let me know because I feel like my kids have written this from the future.
It's hard to separate trauma symptoms from autism because society as is stands provides no options for raising an autistic child without traumatizing them. 

That said a lot of the signs you see in your mom are trauma symptoms including oversharing, shame, and lack of a social network. 

The loudness and inability to shut her mouth could be ADHD. The low threshold for injustice and change could be autism. However there's much here that may be pure trauma. 

Being physically beat by your entire immediate family and never allowing yourself space to recover or have other loving relationships messes with one's brain as much or more than natural neurodivergence.
I know we‚Äôre not supposed to diagnose others or ourselves, but ever since I started doing more reading about neurodivergence and understanding what the symptoms look like, I kind of suspect my whole family has something going on. I definitely see it in my own mother (although she is a lot different from your description of your mother). 

And I honestly kind of think you can easily start to see these patterns in your own family members, and it‚Äôs kind of justified to see it in your parents since it‚Äôs known to to run in families, especially if you have been formally diagnosed yourself. And we now know how it is much more common in women than previously thought. 

I think it sounds like she has some complex issues though. Like she definitely had a traumatic upbringing but also it sounds like she is definitely autistic. 

Some of your descriptions sound exactly like my sister. My sister has recently been diagnosed with ADHD- hyperactive and she also believes she is autistic. It makes sense to me because:
- she also has the motor-mouth thing going on
- she definitely tends to over share and talk about stuff that you shouldn‚Äôt about in public, and she gets defensive if I tell her we‚Äôre not supposed to talk about those things in public. It seems like she has a hard time understanding social contexts
- she also has poor spatial awareness and coordination and stomps and slams doors without meaning to, and I don‚Äôt believe this is stimming by the way, as well as dropping things frequently (I also have this issue minus the stomping and slamming doors though)
- she also has difficulty with changes (when she was a little kid she would have meltdowns, and I think I did too; they called them temper tantrums back then)
- she‚Äôs also super smart (and can come across arrogant at times), I think being told how smart she was as a kid didn‚Äôt help
- she‚Äôs also highly anxious (I think it‚Äôs basically a defense mechanism that develops due to repeatedly having getting in trouble for saying or doing the wrong things, and I have this too but to a lesser degree), 
- she also has the sensory issues with clothes
- she also was bullied as a child. 

I don‚Äôt know if all of these things you listed count as aspects of autism or adhd, like I‚Äôm not sure that being confused about your sexuality is related? I think part of it must be cultural. A lot of older patriarchal cultures have made women feel ashamed for their sexualities and the only way to be a sexual person was if you were trying to get pregnant. 

I think the shame and self-criticism is an aspect of depression. Honestly, it sounds like she has severe untreated anxiety and depression, and maybe it is partially because of her being different her whole life and the trauma that can cause a person. And it could be related to her religious upbringing or just the way she was treated by her parents, or all of the above. 

Now I don‚Äôt know how productive it is to give her this label if she isn‚Äôt seeking it herself. But I feel like it can definitely help you understand your own upbringing and relationship with her by viewing it through a different lens."
MIL,26,motherinlawsfromhell,"I hear you.  Sounds like you have decided that you have spent 6 years of your life trying to be a wife, mother and partner, but he is still treating his mother as his wife, and you are second place.  It is unfortunate to say but it sounds like you need to move on for your own mental health -- sooner rather than later.
You can‚Äôt have it both ways. You can‚Äôt attack her via text and move on for your own sake. First off you resent this woman, that‚Äôs fine. This issue is you‚Äôre trying to get you husband to simply cut off his parents. That‚Äôs not a choice you get to make. You can go NC. You can leave the home for visits, you can grey rock, and not respond. But honestly you can‚Äôt try to force a choice. They are his parents, despite everything he loves them, he wants them in his life. Trying to push an ultimatum is destroying your marriage. Your husband‚Äôs inability to choose is hurting you as well as his inability to fight for you. That is an issue. 

But texting a family group chat all of your grievances? That will blow up in your face. You will be the bad guy, and it will look that way. If you feel you absolutely have to I would speak to your husband first. Explain that this build up of hatred is hurting you and your marriage. That you have specific points that you would like to speak with MIL regarding. Set ground rules and arrange a meeting. It probably won‚Äôt go well but at least your issues are out there. Then you and you alone can go NC.
Is your counsellor an enmeshment trauma counsellor?

The porn is very very common with enmeshed men. Food addiction is the way most enmeshed women go. The porn addiction is not about you, it started well before you and it's your husband's attempt to emancipate from his mother, but within a relationship, it can cause damage. Ken Adams covers this concept well. Please don't let it impact you, it's not about you although it can feel very personal. 

Don't bother texting the group chat, they don't care. Just take your child and leave, take your space, go to a hotel and have a holiday and tell your husband when he rings you that he needs to think about what's most important to him, that you won't hold it against him if he chooses his mother, you just want to have the facts and he needs time to decide. Don't overwhelm him with anger or emotion, that's what his mother does. 

Just be matter of fact and start to look at options for your life. As another person said, you can start taking your child to playgroup on the weekend, you can go away for the weekend, you can book your child into some kind of class, you can stay home when he goes to his mother's. You don't have to do what they say and you can be your own circuit breaker as your husband is clearly unwilling to. Don't wait for someone else to make it OK for you to live your life as you wish. 

Please get support and help just for yourself, particularly with the losses and grief you've suffered. Take yourself out of the house with your child to physically limit the contact so you can find yourself again and connect with your child. If your husband comes along for the ride, great, if not, leave him where he is. Best wishes.
So, which is it? Do you want to attack her in group chat, or do you want to move on?
 Maybe it's time for LO to join a Saturday morning play group. If you are gone before she arrives, no drama in your face. If she wants to wait around, maybe she and her dear baby son can enjoy some quality time together and clean the house.
Unless husband is willing to do the hard yards in enmeshment therapy along with couples therapy, then I think you have your answer‚Ä¶..

No point sending messages to a group chat. 2 card your husband and do as you say - 6 years of trying but it‚Äôs too much‚Ä¶..  I wish you much luck and happiness moving forward."
Weakness is not a good thing and it should be avoided where possible.,23,TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Weakness is comparative. It's kind of like ugliness. It's always gonna exist. It's hard to even have a concept of what strength and beauty are without weakness and ugliness. It's not possible to know what is high if you don't know what is low.

Yes, we should strive for improvement, but we will never reach perfection.
I think you are missing the point when people say it is ""it's okay to be vulnerable"" or ""it's okay not to be okay."", people do say we should be, but sometimes you just are not in a good place, and you shouldn't be ashamed of it, in that way it is okay to be vulnerable.

Often it is because of this dumb notion that we shouldn't show weakness, and we should just hide it away, be a real man or some other dumb notion, but we are all weak at times, and it is okay to be weak at times, it isn't something that you should hide away and eat at you from the inside.

So in short you are missing the whole point when people say that, no one is saying go and be weak, sad and vulnerable, but that you shouldn't he ashamed and hid it, work through it, or get help, that's the whole point when people say those things.

It's like when people say it's okay to eat chocolate, doesn't mean you should go out and eat it all the time.
Can you actually give an example of a person thinking a weakness is a good thing? Specifically, how it relates to the disabled community?
>""it's okay to be vulnerable,"" or, ""it's okay not to be okay.""

My dude, ""it's okay to be vulnerable"" means ""don't live your life with your shields up all the time. Get to know people.  Let them get to know you. You don't need to appear perfect because you're not.""

""It's okay to not be okay"" means ""it's part of the human Condit that at some points in our lives we will not feel satisfied with who we are. We should accept that this is something everyone experiences. That's okay. You can get through this.""

Not understanding this is a *you* problem.

>therefore, it can never be said to be bad to have these things, and furthermore, it must actually even be good to have these things.

Even without knowing the context of whatever ""comment section"" you are referring to, I can tell you didn't understand the conversation. People were *very likely* explaining to you how we shouldn't stigmatize people because of weaknesses, or that weaknesses are natural or ""good"" in the sense that we should accept them as part of the human condition and not ignore them.

I *highly* doubt that anyone was trying to argue that the condition a weakness leaves you with makes you ""better"" in every way.

I can *see* the shadows of the straw men you were building in that comment section.

>This becomes blisteringly obvious the moment we throw up some thought experiments oriented in the opposite direction.

That's a *fantastic* euphemism for ""straw men.""

>and the more of it that we have, the better. In fact, we should actually seek to impair one another as a favour

You can't possibly think this is a logical extension of the ""It's okay to have a weakness"" position. This is braindead logic. As in, people would only think this is the logical extension of that saying if they were braindead. You are assuming everyone is incredibly stupid and can't understand that a pithy saying isn't always meant to be taken literally.

Do you have similar problems with the literal interpretation of ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away""?

>But if we do agree that something is a weakness, and in many cases we can, then it follows that this weakness is not a good thing

Sure, but the two exceptionally vague truisms you are whining about (""it's okay to be vulnerable"" and ""it's okay to not be okay"") *are not saying what you think they are saying about ""weaknesses.""*
Your whole Idea is based on the Idea that there are objective weaknesses. What would these be ?"

Love the last paragraph & how you ended your post with determination + positivity. Yes ‚Äî you will bust though & we'll be there with you along the way! ‚ô•Ô∏è
I like how from your last paragraph I can see you aren't giving up, but damn I can feel the pain there.

When we are at the height of confusion, cognitive dissonance and half-worn off brainwashing I think it's very common and easy to wild out and do bad things. Doesn't mean we won't or shouldn't face the consequences of our actions, but I think we can face them clear eyed and not beat ourselves up give in to despair. We are victims and that created conditions where we sometimes did bad things, either for rhe cult or in rebellion to the cult and we might pay a price for that, but our stories don't have to end there.

Now you can work on yourself to be a better person and create the conditions where if you ever giving a chance to rekindle a relationship with your son you can or if he ever needs you, you can be there."

Finally overcoming my biggest question about islam|will non muslims go to hell?was Aisha 9? Are slavery and concubines allowed in islam?,23,progressive_islam,"Regarding Slaves and Concubines, In short, Slaves are not allowed and someone is under your influence, you need to have nikkah (marriage) with consent before you can't touch each other.

Surah Nisa 24.

*Also (prohibited are) women already married, except those legally yours: Thus hath Allah ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property,- desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefit from them, give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.*

***You need to get context as well read the ayat before 24,...***

Surah Nisa 23

*Prohibited to you (For marriage) are:- Your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, Mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (Who gave you suck), foster-sisters; your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in,- no prohibition if ye have not gone in;- (Those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful;-*

These goes over that¬†**these women are forbidden for you to marry**. Except what has already happen, as you didn't know that it is against Allah's command. I don't see Rape anywhere here...Instead Allah is asking men to give gifts and desire chastity not LUST.
Hi OP,

  
Let me answer questions directly from QURAN: in Short, just by BEING ""MUSLIM"" doesn't qualify for heaven & just by being ""non-muslim"" doesn't mean automatic hell.

Those who believe and work righteous deeds,- from them shall We blot out all evil (that may be) in them, and We shall reward them according to the best of their deeds.

and finally Almighty mentions that there will be a scale and 1 good deed is worth 10 points while 1 bad deed is worth only 1 point:

Regarding Aisha being 9, This is historical perspective, Quran rejects this.

From Quran, Muhammad is not a Human but a messenger of GOD and is not father of any of men. He is seal of the prophets (certifier of prophets, a prophet can't claim to be one without certification of Muhammad)

33.40

Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah, and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.

3.144

Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then Turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; but Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude.
i also want to way that even if aisha was married at a young age, that doesn't make the‚Äã prophet sinful that just means that society back then had different standards for marriage"
What is your local hospital like?,22,schizoaffective,"I live in Finland. In my area psychiatric inpatient care is free for the patient.
I can use my laptop, phone, and have my own toiletries. I can use my own pyjama or they can provide one (this also applies to toiletries).
There is food four times a day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, evening snack. All kind of special dietary requirements are taken into account.
But there is really nothing to do, no therapy or group activities.
My experiences in the past have actually been really good. No cell phones but you could earn walks twice a day, and you could order out food. I only had a few bad run in's with other patients that made it clear they wanted to hurt me but the staff sorted that out quickly
In NY and the hospital I stayed at is kinda shitty and clearly underfunded but the staff is generally trying their best.

No electronics allowed so only books, coloring, board games and the TV in the lounge were there to distract yourself. Family and friends are allowed to schedule visits to bring you stuff. There were groups twice a day with arts/crafts and discussions about building life skills. Also had rec time for 45 mins every day where we could listen to music outside on the deck or use the gym. 

The food wasn't bad honestly. The burgers and chicken tenders were pretty good and they put out snacks a lot too so you never went hungry.
no phones no toiletries some clothes no shoes no outside access bc then an alarm would ring and you will get ‚Äúbooty-juiced‚Äù - room bound at certain times of day only allowed a book MAYBE pencils to draw. at times we could go outside to the 25ft x 25ft roof with walls that had 10 inch thick windows and was covered with a giant cage (there was nothing to do out there)


I'm in Canada and it varies with if you're on an involuntary hold, or have self-admitted.  

The last time:   initial room in ER had no bathroom and a nazi nurse at night who refused to let people out of their locked rooms to go to the bathroom.  These rooms were in a locked section of ED and no, you couldn't have anything

Then you're moved to the psych ward.  Those who have self-admitted can go out to a courtyard and smoke, can leave with family for periods of time, and have their phones.  The psych floor has a locked/secure entrance and sign-in/sign-out including for visitors.   The rooms have a toilet and sink."
Thoughts on „Åå„Çâ„Åè„Åü - JUNK ,22,KenshiYonezu,"My mom and I had a very rocky relationship for the past 10 years and the madness peaked when I was pregnant 2 years ago. I've been on edge ever since and prepared to cut ties if things get out of control. Earlier this year my mom had a psychotic episode while visiting me and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It turns out she has been hearing voices for a really long time. This song made me feel like a piece of garbage in the most cathartic way.
Yonezu talked about this song on Spotify Podcast. There are subtitles. I think you can refer to it.

This song is based on a friend who had a mental breakdown. If you read my comment on the Himawari post, the friend mentioned in JUNK is most likely Matsumoto Dai.
It‚Äôs one of the best melodies I‚Äôve ever heard, I say that about almost every Kenshi song but there‚Äôs just so much sheer emotion bundled up in this one. He gets at something so deep, I‚Äôve listened so many times already and i‚Äôm still just barely beginning to get a handle on the emotional vibe.

Third Trimester Body Issues + Clueless Husband,19,BabyBumps,"I think it‚Äôs pretty fair how you feel. Love is blind is a show to go be single and fall in love and get married to someone else so honestly the most appropriate thing would have been for him to not follow this lady and give you some reassurance. 
You are pregnant so probably more sensitive and vulnerable yes, but I think that‚Äôs not some reason to dismiss how you feel but actually to be a little bit more gentle and reassuring and be even more clear with boundaries. 

if you are able to express all of that without putting him down but rather just letting him know right now is a bit of a harder time for you emotionally and that you feel a little extra insecure and vulnerable, maybe he can understand where you‚Äôre coming from.
No, I would be upset about him accepting the follow request and following back the woman on Instagram as well.
I think it‚Äôs clearly stroking his ego like you said. Hormobes definitely don‚Äôt help, esp in 3rd tri. I will say when I was concerned about a similar situation while pregnant, my husband was super supportive and didn‚Äôt try to minimize my concerns (but also definitely understood that it was exacerbated by my hormones and needed to be more sensitive). I think my husband started using r/daddit and it helped him understand my physical and emotional changes in pregnancy too.
There have been a few instances in my marriage where my husband has done something and I immediately look at him and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt talk like that to you‚Äù or ‚Äúhow would you like if I did [that]‚Äù and a light bulb goes off and he immediately snaps out of it and apologizes. He‚Äôs also done that to me a few times. 

Pregnancy aside, how would he like it if you accepted a follow request and followed back someone who hit on you and who‚Äôs original purpose for messaging was to get you to do something involving dating other people? It‚Äôs inappropriate. Tbh I have a feeling he knows it‚Äôs inappropriate already based on his dramatic reaction. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll delete my IG then‚Äù. 

The other thing you can do is come right out and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve asked you to unfollow her because this is inappropriate and hurts me. I‚Äôm not interested in an apology or an argument, do it or don‚Äôt do it, you know where I stand‚Äù. 

If he‚Äôs a normal, caring adult, he‚Äôll come around.
I‚Äôd be irritated with the fact he even responded to her lol. Just me though."
sometimes I just want to cry.,20,Parentification,"The turning point for me was a random youtube video the algorithm suggested to me, in which a therapist demonstrated a roleplay of a healthy parent saying to their adult child, ""I know you're worried about me, but I've got my own therapist and circle of friends for support. I don't ever want you to feel like you need to be my therapist."" I had a full-body reaction to the idea that my mom would ever have the self-awareness that she had turned me into her caretaker. 

It's been a slow process of disentangling myself from that enmeshment, but geographical distance (living far away), therapy, and education has really helped. Recently I've been really impacted by the book ""Discovering Your Inner Mother"" which deals with the concept of the mother wound and re-parenting yourself. It also talks about the way the family system often demands a parentified child stays the way they are, as caretaker, family secretary, and mediator, and resists the child's attempts to change. 

I think what you're feeling is grief! It makes a lot of sense. I don't think the grief ever fully goes away, but as things start to shift in your life, I really believe you can find more peace and that the heaviness will start to lift.
Damn your situation sounds a lot like mine. I see how much love you have for your family. I understand what it‚Äôs like to be the eldest and ‚Äúfirst to complete‚Äù those benchmarks. Now when younger siblings struggle, we are the ones they turn to. 

I also understand the fear of an enmeshed family ruining your relationship or hope of love. Your partner understands you and loves you. They will not leave you for seeing you cope and manage this unfortunate situation. Your life is for you to live. I believe you making this post is an acknowledgement of that, and I‚Äôm proud of you.
I'm really sorry. It's very overwhelming to carry so much responsibility before we are ready to do it. It's encouraging to me that you have already redirected things in order to care for yourself, taking a different job and role in your career. How you sound in what you write reminds me of the many grief cycles I've gone through over the years. Usually during life transitions of some kind; like maturing, next stages of relationships, the age of my kids, stages of education, stages of jobs and career, my health. It was like all the stress and worry would get heavier, and that feeling of crying. But from way down deep and unspecified. I learned it was grieving (denial, anger, bargaining, sadness, acceptance). And those moments were the stage of grieving where you need to cry. I also learned that I needed to do a better job of prioritizing myself as much as I cared for others. I didn't need to care for others less, although that happened as I learned about boundaries, but I did need to care for myself in equal measure. One for one ratio.

Education (like therapy) helped tremendously. Understanding what was going on in my internal world, gaining language to describe and talk about it, learning tools for coping and feeling more in control of my existence all has led to stability and peace. There's still plenty of moments where I struggle, but not remotely to the depth that you speak of. So things do get better. Also, meds. Those are a God send for giving you some stability and peace while you learn how to create that for yourself but haven't quite gotten there yet. Five stars. Haha

Hang in there. Each tiny change you'll make with the help of your therapist creates a ripple effect that lasts a lifetime. It won't be like right now, forever. There's light at the end of the tunnel. BIG hugs because you are not alone. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
The solutions that you find for family situations must include the family member's participation in the solution, including financial solutions. Call family meetings and let them know that the weight of their problems are causing you hardship and together you need solutions that will raise all your boats.

We reviewed Wrenbriar's letter again.,19,therapycritical,"So, he's gone, huh? I wasn't sure. The end of 200 pages started getting repetitious, not that I blame him. I sort of just skimmed the last several pages. 

I empathized with him and shared many of his opinions. Forcibly ""treating"" someone against their will should be illegal. What was done to him was criminal, but I bet Fgst is still practicing.
If this post is to remain up, I will need the document in question to be linked in the comments. 

I understand why you may not have done so before given rule #5, but it's important for context sake here and I will allow it.
If i remember correctly, he went to the psych ward twice. The first one was voluntary, and he got traumatized, hence why he didn't want to go there anymore. But, when he returned to the MH1 after being interrogated involuntarily by MH during his ER visit, MH1 sent him to the psych ward and that is when he finally had enough of MH providers.
He did it. He actually did it. I saw his post and commented to dm me before he did it. I never heard from him. 

This is so tragic. RIP man. I'm so sorry.

Does anybody else feel like they‚Äôll never be the same? ,18,LifeAfterNarcissism,"Yea I don't think I'll ever be the same and it irreparably altered my worldview and destroyed the last remnants of any self confidence I had. I'm seeking therapy soon though so idk
That's what narcissistic abuse does to a person. I am not the same person I was before. TBH, I'm not sure who I am right now. I just know that the old me is gone. I've tried getting back to her, but she no longer exists. It's hard to accept, but we're capable of healing and growing into better, stronger people. It isn't easy and a lot of patience is required, but it's possible.
I'm not the same person I was. I'm not functioning as I used to; I feel so much pain and blame myself for bringing myself to this lowest place. I feel stupid for believing him, I feel stupid for falling for him. Sometimes I hear his voice in my head, laughing at me or attacking me, while I try to stay focused and deal with basic daily tasks. My ability to function as a person has completely changed for the worse. I had a goal to become a psychologist; I was full of fire and passion for my goals. I enjoyed studying in college and was good in my classes. I returned to college this year, and now I'm failing. I‚Äôve never failed a course before. I just couldn't study, no matter how many ADHD pills I took. The pain is too distracting. My inability to function also affects my social life, my career that‚Äôs going downhill, my ability to trust new people, and my ability to trust love.

It's been almost two years, and although I'm getting better (with the help of a great psychologist), I'm still not the same, and it feels like endless work. I haven‚Äôt been able to feel genuinely happy again since then. I do feel things, but it's like everything has weakened. Every emotion feels like an echo of something buried inside me, trapped by the memories of being abused for so long.

If you haven't heard about CPTSD, you should look it up; maybe it will help you understand yourself better. Part of PTSD is depression, so everything you feel has a name and a way to handle it. I recommend starting therapy with a psychologist who is an expert in dealing with trauma and depression.

As I said before, it could take time, but it's worth it. You are not alone.
I know not everyone will have the same experience as me but I feel like I‚Äôve changed because my boundaries are much stronger and my standards are very high now.

TW: Domestic abuse ,19,Dhaka,"Don't go to police, please look for women & child protection organization. Reddit is used by very nieche people of Bangladesh. I'd suggest to write this in Bangla in desparately seeking dhaka facebook group. Ask for any help from such organization, your goal should be to find a mediator to talk on your behalf to your parents. Trying to make them understand what you are going through. It'd be challenging to support yourself with education if you leave your parents. So take measured step. If you really want to break free of them, then you have to be financially independent. Try to learn some skill, like, design, web site development, wordpress development, wix site building, SEO, marketing etc. Try to get some work from upwork, fiverr etc. then you can support yourself & study
This is very unfortunate and quite common in Bangladesh. I have seen something like that in my own family. My relative is now in serious mental distress. She is now getting help from physiatrist and lots of medication and yet to get better. I really don‚Äôt understand why parents in Bangladesh like that. It‚Äôs also not safe at all for lone girls in the country. See if your parents will allow you to abroad to study? If so that will be your best option. Really don‚Äôt know how can anyone help you? If anyone try to help they might get in trouble from your parents.
Since you're 19 now, is there any way you can have your own NID made? You can open bkash account with your NID.
First of all I think you should contact some specific women helpline in bangladesh (I don't know if they are still on after what happened in bangladesh). Polive will not do anything rather they can make your situation worse. You will not find any good advice in reddit because most bangladeshi don't use this app. Create a new Gmail account that is just yours and post many anonymous (if you want to be anonymous) post in Facebook groups that is based on helping each other. You can also post in groups that are related with domestic violence. Fleeing your home would end badly given the current situation in bangladesh where no kidnapping case is being picked by the police and media. Sorry if this is personal but can you tell me your district? I'm from chittagong, if you are from chittagong than I can help you with helpline and shits. Don't give too much ear to them. Personally I've never experienced these type of things but my older sister was emotionally abused by our entire family so i wanna help as much as I can. Your story feels very similar to her but she fought every battle and honesty lives a better life. Of course you will feel depressed, who wouldn't in your situation but please believe in yourself and believe that your situation will change. Motivate yourself with the online work you want to do.

Would this be allowed here?,17,ufyh,"Habitat includes the garden - I think it should be allowed. I would love to see some before and after, and with the same angles and light would be amazing. I work equally on unfucking the garden and home as they are both part of my sanctuary.
I think that yard stuff would be fine without explicit permission, since it‚Äôs already visible to the public. But it‚Äôs also about her feelings, not just ethics, and you‚Äôd know that better than us. :)

If you do a post for the yard, I‚Äôd be happy to take a look and give you a list of steps of how I would go about tackling it. [Here‚Äôs an example of another post in this sub that was looking to do a yard overhaul, and the list of tasks I suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/s/0ytTT5GYzP). Maybe you‚Äôll get some inspo to get started, and maybe you can even show your mom! The poster made a follow up post when they were done if you wanna check out an after.
I wouldn't post the pictures- your mom doesn't even want you taking them. Descriptions should be fine.

Once you have your plan, ask your mom what she would prefer you to start with. For example, if the grass bothers her the most, start with whatever needs to happen to mow the lawn. 

I saw below that you think this could be her sanctuary and it might build up to inside the house and I think you're right to start with the garden!! But I would start with safety issues as my first focus in the garden (ie get rid of the big toys that are trip hazards before worrying about weeds in the pavement cracks). If/when she gives you permission/it's time to tackle the inside, again start with focusing on safety issues.
I really don't think you should secretly photograph your mom's mess, and definitely don't post the pictures online if you do.
Go for it! I think garden is habitat. Agree with others though re permission re pictures."

Rethinking Nietzsche,17,Nietzsche,"This is very thought-provoking. Dostoyevsky was less optimistic that man could fully orient himself without God (a higher power in general) and really explores that in *Crime and Punishment* and *Notes from Underground*. Nietzsche believed that man would one day be able to invent good and evil for himself without, for instance, God. He taught that we would essentially have to become gods to ourselves (the Superman). But Dostoy, a devout, yet pessimistic Christian, writes that man is *incapable* of being gods: because we were created to *need* God as creations *of* God.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts. It offered some interesting perspectives on the utter loneliness of the Nietzschean project.
Nietzsche quite explicitly calls for Dionysian unity.
Nietzsche used what was in his time: ""the herd"" was a workforce of mostly poorly educated workers fresh from ignorant farming communities that were often quite insular and deeply tied to the moral authority of the church. It was easy to speak of Marx's ""workers"" in those days and perhaps easier to unify them as a herd. In Russia, this can be observed in the lead up to the revolution -- it's astounding how many peasants stubbornly stuck with the Tsar and genuinely believed him to be an impartial Father-figure. Little did they know that Tsar Nick was an absolute old-school tyrant, etc. etc. Of course, when that spell broke, it broke. 

Today ""the herd"" is deeply fractured and looks much less like that mass of peasant factory workers and more like a bunch of auto-exploiting productivity nuts typing frantically in cubicles, working on efficient personal schedules, pleasant, but impersonal, making goals and sub-goals, isolating themselves at home, working from home, and so on. There's still lots of traditional blue collar workers (who often get excluded on subs like this, I must say) but they're smaller in number than they were before, and of course the wage spectrum is wide and so there's not so much of a stark underclass and so on like there was in those late Victorian times. 

In other words, in Nietzsche's formulation, which is often misunderstood, I believe the herd is a requirement, and a pre-condition for the individual who rises above the herd. One needs that stark underclass, all unified by nationalistic or religious morality, all ticking along on the same-type wavelength, to produce free spirits (in Nietzsche's view, they came from the aristocracy -- also greatly diminished). Without the unification of the herd, nothing could get done on a national level. There would be no unity, no great projects, and no ability for free spirits to lead the herd into new ways of being. 

This is a more accurate picture of our current situation in Nietzschean terms: **the herd is not doing what the herd is supposed to do.** Since the herd will not unify into a herd, there is disunity, disillusionment. There's no established order that the free spirits are supposed to engage with. Left to their own devices, and with only crappy content and paltry, mundane philosophy to engage with (which typically prattles on about how people should be even more productive, work even longer hours, have more discipline \[to work longer hours\], take economic risks, and so on ie: business advice in the guise of personal philosophy), the herd is splitting apart and spinning out in depression and anxiety. 

In my opinion, the central flaw to Nietzsche's stuff is that he can't ever imagine a world where everybody is like a free spirit. He thinks it's pretty much impossible, because people are so herd-like in his time. There's not a lot of solutions in Nietzschean philosophy for the current situation: the herd is becoming un-herd-like. **If the defining feature of the overman is that he splits apart from the herd, then what defines the overman in a society without a cohesive herd?** ie: a society of many separate sub-herds living within a wider wage-spectrum (and lead by an elite totally disconnected from any old school European notions of nobility or philosophy, but rather an elite centrally concerned with profit.) Tough questions. 

I still think that these are sub-herds, and that free spirits remain rare beasts. A free spirit in our situation would naturally try to pull away from what the herd is doing, and if the herd is splitting into isolated groups increasingly obsessed with productivity, then the free spirit might suggest that the herd get back together in unity and re-engage with morals beyond sheer productivity and brutal marketplace ethics.

And so, alongside the aesthetic necessity of beauty runs the demand of ""Know thyself"" and ""Not too much!"", while self-aggrandisement and excess were regarded as the actually hostile demons of the non-Apollonian sphere, hence as characteristics of the pre-Apollonian age, the age of the Titans, and the non-Apollonian world, i.e. the barbarian world.

**NF-1885,40\[44\] -  August-September 1885.** But this is exactly how I treat myself: self-knowledge does not belong to the feelings of obligation; even if I seek to recognise myself, it is for reasons of usefulness or a finer curiosity, - but not out of a desire for truthfulness. - That the truthful man is worth more than the liar, in the household of mankind, is still to be proved."

I agree. I find it odd that it‚Äôs not even in the meeting minutes. I‚Äôm wondering if there was not even a meeting to discuss it? Those meetings are open to students to attend. I‚Äôd love to see how the idea came about.
It‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt have the right to vote on this matter, like OP is leading you to believe lol it‚Äôs not a democratic process of any kind. It‚Äôs an administrative issue and denying it doesn‚Äôt make it less true. It is a privilege to have medical benefits and coverage, not a right, and certainly not an obligation of any corporation, private or public, to provide its members with coverage.  These plans are notoriously costly to provide employees with so employers change them when necessary. No employer would ever ask their employees for their opinion on their health care plan. Universities are no different. Unions are one of the rare instances that have some bargaining power with employers to pressure them into giving their employees better benefits. But even then, the union is bargaining with the employer, not voting on anything, and the employer is within their rights to say no to any demands made by a union. The union reps may ask their wider base what they would like to see, but those reps then make a decision, and that decision may or may not reflect the collective interest of the members. OP seems to think this is ‚Äújust an opinion‚Äù that I have, but it‚Äôs literally how the world works. You never had the right to vote on your healthcare plan.

Summary of President John Henry Stelle's First Term (1953-1957) | A House Divided Alternate Elections,17,Presidentialpoll,"This is what happens when one party holds onto power for too long, people! America is devolving into a one party state again, and now the party is getting drunk on power, thinking it can do whatever and people won't have enough.

  
Quite frankly, it's time we tell Stelle and the autocratic wing of Federalist Reform that we are having enough. This charade that they put up, pretending to care about law and order whilst raising the heat so that the frogs don't jump out of the water just yet...

  
They may have won us WW2, but they've squandered the good will of the American people for the last time. Perhaps 1956 will be their undoing.
A president who took us backwards instead of forward. Corruption to his cronies runs rampant. He broke the alliance with Europe after we saved it. He almost built concentration camps for his own countryman as if it was another country in the Pact of Iron and was only stopped by other patriots, barely. And in the meanwhile we have a return to the violence of 40 years ago in the streets. It is a great shame to all Americans that this man is sitting in the house where Charles Edward Merriam once lived, and I say that as member of his own party. Shame on the history of this country that once fought this evil abroad in World War II.
Remarkably bad, the worst leader since Grant.
We should vote for him for the FRP nomination,this way the Popular Front can win!
As the Federalist Reform Party approaches 20 years of dominance over presidential politics, is the party under President John Henry Stelle yet still recognizable?

Going to a therapist will help you deal with your trauma, not only the trauma of what happened to you, but your daughters and nieces, and help you deal with the mountain of misplaced guilt you‚Äôre carrying.
Well I can say I read every single word on this post! 

The title speaks volumes and I can only imagine what you are going through and it must be really hard and difficult. 

I can sense you are angry and frustrated and you wanted to protect your loved ones. 

By reading this post I feel you are such a strong person and it is admirable how you have instilled yourself with core values and you know what is right from wrong. You have had to face hurdle after hurdle and you come out fighting strong.

I understand what you are feeling right now and please take care of yourself.
Wow! You are a survivor and a very strong woman for standing up! 

 This is not your fault, you are a victim. Sometimes we do things or expose ourselves  to something like that because it's so traumatic, our brain doesn't want to acknowledge it. 

There is a relatively new therapy called EMDR. It's eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. I have been a cop for 25 years and a soldier in the Army Reserve 27. I have seen things that would make a civilian puke and break your heart, and make you hate the human race all at the same time. 

I have used EMDR to help file away the bad stuff. It helped me tremendously. 

I had a difficult childhood. My parents divorced when my twin sister and I were 5, big brother was 11. My sister and I stayed with my mother, brother with father. 

My mother would never admit it, be she too played the emotional yo-yo game along with my father. 

It was never physically abusive, but sure was mentally. Growing up, sometimes we would get a birthday card or Christmas present sometimes we wouldn't. It was so demeaning and disappointing. 

I still have some of those scars with me today. I get excited just knowing that there is an Amazon package being delivered. I've only recently put the two together and am going to schedule a session with my therapist. 

I guess my point is, no matter how old you are, get therapy. Get the bad stuff filed away so it's not in your face. Enjoy life.
I'm so sorry. My heart hurts. It is not our fault for what our parents did to us! We were kids with no compas telling us if what they were doing to us was right or wrong. We learned that later. You regressed those parts of your life like I did. Please don't blame yourself! Put the blame where it belongs!! Right at your parents' door, not yours, but theirs. Ring the dam doorbell! I also went to therapy that was a wash, rinse, and repeat. Until I learned of TMS, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It is used mainly for depression, but it helped me me in so many ways. Yes, I was depressed, but I was also mad and confused. There was no way I was going to go back into the same therapy I'd been in, off and on, since my 20""s. Please look into this. I feel much better about myself and what happened. I don't know why this helped me so much, but I am very thankful that a friend recommended it to me. You aren't alone, there are many of us who have gone through similar abuse and felt ashamed and that it was our fault for not saying something earlier. You have now. Now people are aware. You need to take care of you and your daughter now. Forget the others who went NC. It's sad they didn't believe us. But we know, and now they are aware, even though they won't recognize it.
I did read your entire post and just wanted to make sure you know that it isn't your fault, and it never was. We need to be proud that we've made it to when and where we are today."

Jas and Fyang  ,15,pinoybigbrother,"I feel bad for both Jas and Fyang. Ginagamit sila ng PBB para sa madaming views to the point na kahit masira ang image ng dalawa. At the same time I feel like the adults really treat it as a challenge kasi halata naman na ang PBB favors the teens sa challenges parang ginawa talaga na manalo sila. So ang adults ay lumalaban talaga. I think the real manipulative here is the PBB kasi grabe na mga ginagawa nila para sa madaming views. Nasasad lang ako na most of the fans mas masyadong dala ng emotions because of the housemate they root for. Ayoko na din manood starting now kasi I understand naman ang PBB kumukuha sila ng scenes na makakapag pataas ng views pero parang sobra na yung ginagawa nilang pagmamanipulate to the point na sobrang nagsisiraan na ang housemates sa loob, sinisira image nila sa viewers at mental health ng housemates
This is true. Sobrang manipulated talaga ng PBB lahat. I guess iba na rin yung target market ng PBB ngayon. They know na easily triggered yung generation ngayon. I‚Äôm not saying na it‚Äôs their fault too. Kasi nag rereact lang din sila sa pinapakita sa kanila. PBB knows how to manipulate the fans and cvs. Pera pera na lang din. The more hate one of them gets, the more BBE na marereceive. Hopefully ito na rin last season ng PBB. Hindi na sya maganda unlike before."
Having a ‚Äúsafe person‚Äù,15,Schizotypal,"I think so? I get overtly attached to one person at a time, though with age I've gotten better about branching out to multiple people. Right now I'd say my safe person is my wife, it's easy to explain to her my symptoms, when they flare up and so on. I've been trying to bring that honesty and trust to others who are close to me. It's a process. Still hard to trust.
I feel the same, I‚Äôm not diagnosed yet but my symptoms get way worse when I‚Äôm alone and I only ever have one person in my life who is truly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù at a time. Right now it‚Äôs my partner but even then, I can‚Äôt get as close with them as they‚Äôd like. I still keep certain things from them and sometimes feel overwhelmed being around them all the time
Experience it too. If I find someone to confide in (takes 6 - 12 months to develop), I stick to them like chewed bubble gum

Hasn't happened in a while and I try to prevent it

Suspect the last person I became attached to had StPD and I didn't realize at the time. Thought we both had AvPD

Pretty sure we were trauma bonding and I'd rather be alone and delusional than attempt that again

Otherwise I've noticed I have this trust + loyalty bar that goes up and down with people. When the trust or loyalty bar gets high enough it kind of becomes locked there and it's difficult for it come back down

Lately I'm pretty bad and... kind of don't want to deal with people...
Nawh, I despise closeness
Because of paranoia I see people in groups. There's pure, normal and dirty. Contrary to what it sounds like, being a pure person is a very bad thing. It makes me co dependent and have a very bad attachment style to that person. I will essentially become obsessed. This isnt healthy and I think its healthy to have paranoia about everyone. So I do understand to some extent how what you describe is hard. I think you really need to work out your attachment style with a psychologist! I wish you luck

(It sounds like being pure is avoidant of paranoia, but this is not the case. Just different type)"

Work issues ,16,SCT,"I understand and can relate to your struggles, as I have been in the same shoes at multiple workplaces or even in school (school was easier, because on tests you have time to yourself to solve it and can't be interrupted by phone calls, emails, socializing, etc.). Even then I used up all the time to get things right, which I did and passed them with good grades, but I was very slow, took a lot of time to just gather the thoughts and organize them.  
10 years ago, I figured out that my mild generalized anxiety, which has sweating related symptoms mostly, come from this mental and physical dullness (or other word which is the opposite of sharp). I can come across as fast and confident if I am well rested, but I'm just a mess when it comes to mental organization. Anyway, back then I went to doctor visits and suggested to take something norepinephrine related, like Strattera. It was not available or they just did not agree, I can't recall, but now I have Strattera in my drawer, afraid to take it because I have cardiovascular issues. I also took anti-anxiety and antidepressant meds, but they did not have a strong effects on anything, let alone these issues.   
What I want to say is that I have the same problem and I have been told to just ignore it, but I observed the onset, intensity and other prospects of my anxiety and can say that this is the primary condition which drives it. Sometimes the anxiety and depression symptoms can show you where the problem is. That being said, sometimes you have to switch of the smoke detector.
Hi, just want to say: I understand and pushing yourself further may lead to burnout. I pushed myself until I was basically only able to lie in bed and stare at the wall. I don't know where the solution is. I looked into just about everything, even just working at a plant nursery, where all of what you mentioned may not be a big deal. Regarding creativity: don't beat yourself up over collecting ideas. We all do it. Someone once said to me: you can only fall as deep as disability pension. True. Not sure where you live, but if worse comes to worse, this might be better than over stressing your brain trying to make it.
what is ur actual job? im currently studying finance in school and vyvanse has been incredibly helpful in minimizing mistakes and helping me focus on the work.
There are so many things to try but instead of just recommending things that may or may not work, I wanted to mention that there are times where I realize ... no one can tell. It's not apparent to them. And I hold myself to a high standard. When I look around at others and see their output, I realize that I'm still ahead or at least tied with them.

Do you get negative feedback?

MST Podcast ,15,VeteranWomen,"Just saw this headline ‚Äú19-year-old cadet found dead in dorm at US Air Force Academy‚Äú on the news side of Reddit. I thought I had copied the link so you could check out the comments section because it has other names/stories. There also is a documentary on this subject. 

I‚Äôve been in MST support groups and even talked with other female veterans not through a support group and unfortunately too many have them have stated the same thing. They experienced sexual harassment or assault and chain of command does nothing to the predator and the victim either gets blamed or punished. 

I got out because I was being sexually assaulted by my NCO, if it wasn‚Äôt for him and that experience I had goals of staying in, retiring, becoming higher enlisted or warrant officer. I was promoted to e4 before my peers. I enjoyed my job. But my NCO was showing up at my house unannounced. He‚Äôd call lower enlisted into his office individually so he could get me in his office alone without it being suspicious. So on and so forth. The thing is, I know I wasn‚Äôt the only one who he did this to. I know because he told me. Who was going to believe me over a charismatic, experienced, combat war hero? 

Anyways, I wish you all the best with your podcast. I once had a vision to start one so I could process my situation, but I‚Äôve seemed to have lost my voice when it comes to vocalizing my story. I‚Äôm doing work in other ways though. :)

"Chronic illness and a bad doctor messed up my relationship with food, but I finally grew tired of that controlling me. Now I'm here, and finally ready to make real changes.",15,loseit,"I remember that day when I had my ""but this time, instead I‚Äôm confident I can make this work"" moment.  It was about Day 100 of my effort when doubt turned more into expectation.  

Be ready for this:   We, being imperect, WILL fall off the wagon (as it were).  Not really, because the whole wagon thing is a poor metaphor when thought of as part of this healthy-lifestyle change.  We don't 'derail' either, there are no rails.  

We're not depending on a wagon or a rail, where falling or crashing would be a disaster and final.  

We're more comparable to being on a roadtrip, where a wrong turn is just a wrong turn.  We don't crash the car and light it afire and live there.   We just make some corrective turns and keep going.  

What we're really working on here are repeating habits and adjusting our expectations around food.   The good habits make the calorie management thing easier and more sustainable.

When we go 6 days and screw up on day 7, it doesn't erase 6 days of repeating good behaviors that we're trying to make into habits.   We might have a calorie setback, but those 6/7 days are in the habit bank.  We've had 6 days of seeing right-sized meals.  And if we keep trying to do righter choices through the wrong-turn, we'll learn something and do better during the next wrong turn (because that will happen too).  Next time we 'fail' -- we'll 'fail better.' 

When you have that moment (or hour) of rebellion and your injured emotions override your rational intentions and strike out, do not be upset or consider it failure.  We never were going to score a 100% 'cure' from our humanity.  Improvement -- enough that our problems aren't at problem-levels anymore -- are what we should expect.

Life is not placid -- there are storms ahead.  We won't handle them perfectly, but we don't have to.  We just have to weather the storms and keep going.
It's taken me a lot of time and work to get to that point in my life where I can stop aiming for perfection every time and getting disappointed when I inevitably fail. I've already been more forgiving with myself on a couple occasions where I normally would have been much harsher; realising I might've eaten a bit too much of something, but thinking ""it's ok, I understand why I got carried away with this food, I will strive to do better next time"" rather than beating myself up over it. Just keep going and try again.

Thank you for the kind words, I appreciate it a lot."
Is it common to have body image issues on someone with BPD?,16,BPD,"Yes, we can all be influenced by others, and if she has a FP, it's likely this person's opinion will take precendence.

She's right; it's her body, she can do what she wants.

But, has she been assessed for body dysmorphic disorder and OCD?  These are often comorbid conditions with BPD that can cause people to see their bodies totally skewed from reality, and also cause them to predominantly think about that topic (ie.. rumination).  I'm a little worried at her doctor's agreeing to go that large as it is starting to sound like a health risk, and a reputable surgeon would probably not agree to do a surgery at this point.

With BPD (and the other disorders mentioned, as well as things like histrionic PD):  we just want a lot of external validation, and it doesn't necessarily mean that we aren't happy with our SO's attention, but the more attention, the more loved you feel, if that makes sense.  This song always reminds me of how i feel, internally: [https://youtu.be/POfxpMqIgRE?si=GT3Cj0L3HVIJRYCg](https://youtu.be/POfxpMqIgRE?si=GT3Cj0L3HVIJRYCg)

Finally, if you are starting to pay less attention to her because you aren't as attracted, I think it's totally fair to voice your opinion to her, in a kind way.  This is a helpful format: [DEAR MAN Skill - Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Tools](https://dbt.tools/interpersonal_effectiveness/dear-man.php)  Something like

""Partner, when you continue to get breast augmentations, I feel anxious that I won't continue to be attracted to you as I have noticed a decrease in my attraction as you've continued to increase in size.  I also feel anxious that you'll be permanently hurt, because each surgery poses a risk of complications.

I think you're beautiful as you are, and I want to continue to communicate in ways that will strengthen our connection, which is why I'm being honest with you about my feelings now.

Before you have another surgery, I would like to go to couple's counseling to talk about this topic so we can clearly see the perspective of the other person.  <Or insert your proposed way of handling this here>""

Before you go into the convo, cope ahead with how you'd handle different reactions from her (e.g. anger, crying/sadness, defensiveness etc.)  It's probably going to hurt her feelings if you say some of this because a lot of people with BPD have things like rejection sensitive dysphoria as well.  And, at the same time, you're allowed to calmly voice your opinion on matters that affect you and your attraction to your spouse.

Then, be ready to really listen to her after you state your opinion to see if there are areas you might compromise on.

Neither of you are assholes, btw - you're just on different pages here.
Yes it‚Äôs extremely common. I was diagnosed BPD at 14, have been living with an eating disorder since 11. 

Body dysmorphia is a diagnostic criteria for BPD in my country and what you‚Äôre describing is exactly that. What you see, she will never see. I think it‚Äôs poor that surgeons have continued to operate without consideration of her mental health but unfortunately plastic surgery is a profitable business and this will always come first. 

Enjoying the ‚Äúattention‚Äù she gets will also be under the BPD umbrella unfortunately. 

You could try and broach this subject sensitively and talk about her views of her body and discuss your concerns from a place of care about her wellbeing but you have to be open to the fact she may become defensive about this. 

This is a very difficult situation and I hope you manage to talk to her in a way that is productive for you both, but I would also be aware that this round of plastic surgery probably won‚Äôt be the last without some sort of therapy and if she isn‚Äôt open to that, I‚Äôd consider how you‚Äôd feel to continue supporting this in your marriage. 

Hugs.
Yes but this is beyond body image and poor sense of self. It sounds like body dysmorphia and maybe an addiction to plastic surgery.
Seek professional help. You cannot control or influence or manipulate her into not wanting these procedures. No matter how hard you try. You don‚Äôt want to control her but it reads as if you want to heavily influence her to not do anything more. 

If it wasn‚Äôt her FP did you ever think she is being influenced by social media like millions of other insecure women who go under the knife to live up to photoshopped imaginary women? I recommend you educate yourself more on bpd and find ways to continue to support your wife and seek professional support as well. If you‚Äôre not attracted to her anymore as hurtful as it may be she might need to know that? Attraction and chemistry are important to me in my personal intimate relationships but your wife may have other trait‚Äôs that are more important to her like financial stability material security ect ect. 

Bpd comes from an invalidating environment and bpd suffers often do crazy shit for attention to make up for the reasons why we were invalidated. This is a deep issue within your wife. I recommend you read up on https://emotionsmatterbpd.org/what-is-bpd 

Bpd is different for everyone but this is a great resource for general information and education for loved ones.
It‚Äôs tricky because yes it is her body, her money, her choice, but it is concerning what it might say about her mental health. 

Before the first surgery, did she talk about getting to this size? Did she ever say anything more than just ‚Äúbigger‚Äù? If the extreme options have been rolling around in her head since before the beginning, it‚Äôs more likely this is what she wants in a healthy way. But if she was expressing a desire for DDs at the beginning and it‚Äôs only been escalating, then it feels like this is an anxiety/insecurity issue. Only she will ever be able to actually analyze her feelings and know for sure how much of this is rooted in fear rather than self actualization. 

How to actually have this conversation in a productive way? Depends on where she is in her mental health journey and how good you are at communicating calmly and compassionately. Is she in therapy or taking meds or learning DBT? From the sounds of it, my guess would be no or it‚Äôs not going great."
"Moving to New York from VA (recommendations wanted) - Small business, taxes, schools, crime, cost of living, etc",14,upstate_new_york,"I would say visit before uprooting. Especially since you've never been here.
Vast areas of upstate NY are economically depressed. 

NY has one of the highest tax burdens in the country. 

The weather is much colder than Virginia in the winter, with a lot more snow.
New York has high taxes sure, but I find they have a lot of rebates and safety net programs that a lot of other states don't have if you fall on hard times. Like you pay a lot in income, property, and school taxes, all separately, but there aren't any personal property taxes. 

So some things to look out for:

-school taxes are separate and can be very high depending on the district, this may not be showing up in your estimating software since it changes from town to town. You can get rebates on this though up to a certain income. As an example, my previous small 90k house was taxed at $4000 in property taxes and $800 in school tax. I received $400 back through STAR rebates.

-insurance rates aren't to bad, mine are $1500 on a $255000 house. Just make sure you aren't in a flood area. Lots of rivers in New York cause issues these days.

-lake effect belts. There are some cities and towns that will get significantly more snow because of nearby lakes, by feet at a time. The big ones are buffalo, Watertown, and Syracuse.

-Adirondack mountains are great, lots of water and outdoor recreation options. services are pretty spread out though, building and zoning can be a big hurdle. A town just outside this area might be what you are looking for, like Plattsburgh, glens falls, or maybe just outside of Syracuse or watertown.

How do I escape from my family home as a 19F? (TW: domestic violence),13,bangladesh,"Hi there,

Starting this by saying, I am not a peer or a fellow teenager, but old enough to be your mom, technically. I don't mean it in a patronising way, but rather to empathise, as I too had experienced a similar kind of familial toxicity (though maybe not as bad) during my childhood, teens, and even all throughout my 20s. 

All my life so far, my relationship with my parents, and especially my father has been nothing but volatile. I have no doubt that in my father's head, he is a man who loves me beyond measure - but I have rarely known of any fatherly love from him. All of the memories I have of him is he criticising me and telling me how I am a disappointment in million different ways. He did provide for me, but he has also used it as a justification to dictate my life choices until he could. My mother, though loving, worshipped my father and could see none of his flaws, and enabled oppression.

I, myself, was also brainwashed for a long, long time to not see how this was toxic, and for the first 30 years of my life, I would blame and guilt myself for not being the good daughter that I should have been. 

I don't have any practical advice that could provide you with relief immediately, but I would urge you to put all the positivity and focus you can muster right now on your A' Levels. Once you get it done, and if you do good, you could apply for scholarships in many different parts of the world and wouldn't need their support. If that doesn't happen, then you may have to wait a little while longer, but this all really ends the moment you are able to provide for yourself financially. Once you no longer have to rely on them, you're free to set your terms. They can either accept, or you can remove them from your life, be it temporarily or permanently. 

I am sorry that you have had to grow up in an unloving and unhealthy environment as this, but I hope that in the future you would give your child (or those you love) all the love you didn't get. IMO, that is only way to heal from the generational toxicity in Bangladeshi families in the long run. In the short run, it is important to not let guilt take over. There is nothing more harmful that wanting to be a good daughter/child. 

Every child is unique with both good and bad, and the onus is actually on the parents to love them unconditionally, and support them. You didn't ask to be born, they brought you into this world, and you don't have to follow their path and lifestyle choices blindly, so long it is not harmful for you.
I went through the same thing as you are now going through.

I was my mom and dad's punching bag. 

Dad's business suffered loss ? Slapped me , kicked me, called me mc/bc/cc

Mom had a quarrel with dad ? Beat me black and blue with stick.

..........

..........

IF YOU LET THEM PHYSICALLY ABUSE YOU, IT'LL ONLY CONTINUE.

The only thing that stopped my sperm donor and pumper stop physically abusing me is : I FOUGHT BACK WHEN THEY TRIED TO HIT ME. I ALWAYS HAD A PEN IN HAND, ANYTIME THEY CAME TO HIT ME , I SHOWED THEM I WOULD DIE AND GO TO THE GRAVE WHILE TAKING THEM TOO.

Don't chicken out. If someone hits you, fight back whoever they maybe (mom,sis,bro, father etc).
which part of BD are you from. If you live in cities like Dhaka I would recommend you tutoring kids. But as you said you are barely passing so idk if anyone will hire you for it. I am 18m and I can feel your pain. I would have been already dead if I was in your shoes
I don't know what can you do to become financially independent as a 19F other than tutoring kids. There are also a bunch of jobs such as call centre operator, copywriter etc which your family will not approve as I can assume. Try to get into a university which is far away from your home if possible. You could start to live by on your own and gain some sort of mental stability. Of course, you will need allowances from your family. I realize this might sound unrealistic, but it's important to be smart and patient as you find your way out.
You're carrying too much pentup trauma. You sound so broken and lost and it‚Äôs clear you need someone to talk to. The more you try to hold it in the more it‚Äôll eat you up from inside. People can only advise you but you‚Äôre the one who has to walk down the hard path and make amends.

The most realistic thing to do now is to avoid confrontation, focus on finishing uni and find a job. That‚Äôs the most logical way to deal this. Secondly, share your thoughts with someone and stop putting yourself to the standards others set for you.... Stop listening to them. Wherever you are and whoever you are you can always build yourself up to be better. Just be yourself



I hope your days gets better with time. Stay strong and don‚Äôt hold back your emotions share them"
First post (very long). I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.,13,raisedbyborderlines,"I am so sorry. I have two chronic illnesses now and it‚Äôs next to impossible to work. I‚Äôm finally in a healthy relationship after leaving an abusive marriage. Are you able to get on disability at all? Have you talked to any social workers? I‚Äôm on food stamps too it‚Äôs not taboo we need help. The economy sucks so hard and when you add being disabled on top of it it‚Äôs worse. 

Have you tried talking to any shelters? I‚Äôd even suggest reaching out to churches you do not have to be religious at all. I‚Äôm Catholic and I can tell you the Catholic Church has resources upon resources to help people regardless of who they are. Just google the archdiocese of your state and start making calls and emails and explain what‚Äôs going on. They will believe you. When I confided in parishioners about my parents they asap made sure I got safe and kept me safe. 

Your health will continue to decline not to be a negative Nancy but it will if you can‚Äôt get away from her. I have PTSD and I barely have PTSD dreams no more because I‚Äôm not in constant contact and being told I‚Äôm a bitch and horrible mother or a dumb ass (my dad‚Äôs favorite insult). 

You deserve to be safe. Same with your sibling. I would encourage your sibling to move out as soon as possible. I‚Äôm incredibly concerned for you because of how debilitating your illness is and how flare ups come from stress. 

Your mom is a fucking cow who doesn‚Äôt deserve that title bc she sucks. Your dad is an adult and with his situation can get ahold of adult services. Y‚Äôall all need to abandon ship. She can stay in that house and scream at the walls. 

We all care about you here please get safe.
I'm so sorry. This reminds me what what my life was like before I left home at 19 (minus the added challenges of your medical situation.) I'm in my 40's now, and while I've gotten hazy on specific details (something our brains naturally do to protect ourselves), I cannot forget how soul crushing it was. 

You mention your mom is going to therapy, but I'm wondering if you also have some kind of regular mental health support?

I know your financial situation might make that hard, but you could start looking in your area for free or subsidized mental health services. I used to get free mental health help from a community college. I was attending at the time, but I think they were open to serving the community at large weren't constrained to students only. 

The first thing I had to address when I was in that situation was to understand and accept that my BPD mom wasn't going to be helpful in my healing process. People with BPD, and especially those that present like your mom, need so much support themselves that they are simply not not capable of truly helping someone else in a meaningful way. 

The reason she ""blacks out"" is because she gets so emotionally off kilter after being triggered that she can only operate on impulse. She doesn't actually have the capacity to think about or understand what she's doing. 

That said, her BPD does ***not*** excuse her behavior. It will help to wrap your head around the idea that while she needs help, you and your family are not capable of giving it to her. 

Why? 

Because the massive negative impact her behavior has on all of you. 

It leaves everyone pretty broken, and in great need of protecting themselves in order to heal. 

I didn't realize it at the time, but when I left, I was beginning to realize that there was nothing I could do to change my mom.  In fact, it was a good life lesson, because it made very clear to me from a very young age that you can't change *anyone* except yourself. 

So I started trying to change myself. To *heal* myself.

When you begin to heal, you'll start to understand why you can't make it happen for someone else. What drives our behavior is so deep within our psyche, that the only person what actually has access is *you*. The same goes for your mom. It's why nothing you do will ever be enough to genuinely make things better for her long-term. That kind of change can only come from *within*. 

Let go of the expectation that she can help you heal, and vice versa. 

You sound like you're in survival mode. I've been there, and it's not fun. My best advice there is to do any little thing you can to take care of yourself, and make small steps to get yourself some support so you can make the bigger moves later.
I could have written this post almost verbatim, except my parents are divorced. I‚Äôm so, so sorry, OP. I literally just went No Contact with my mom yesterday, so I know how painful even considering it is. Like what you said, it‚Äôs not all bad, and the memories of the good keep us holding on wayyyy longer than is healthy for us. 

I would strongly recommend looking into social services to get help moving out (disability, food stamps, etc). Or perhaps there are friends you could move in with? Even temporarily. I know it‚Äôs not always possible financially, but it is time you truly look at every possible option to get out. 

There is no way you can recover and heal physically when you are under so much emotional duress. My partner had Crohns and it always flares up during times of stress. The mind/gut connection is too strong. 

Reading your post and so many here has helped me realize the extent of BPD patterns and behaviors. You are not alone in experiencing things exactly like this. Your feelings of needing it to be done are more than valid. You deserve emotional and physical safety.
It doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love your mom. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs all bad all the time. But you have to choose yourself, however that looks for you.
Welcome!
My heart goes out to you. I relate to everything you have said in this post, from the health issues to being heartbroken over your dad also being abused and your mom‚Äôs blackouts. It‚Äôs a special kind of torture to be treated like this by someone you love‚Ä¶ it is so, so painful. You are not alone. 

The biggest thing I can say is that I think you will come to a point where you have to choose your health and well being over anything else. With your flare ups, mental health challenges and your dad‚Äôs fainting recently as well, it sounds like this point may have been reached or coming soon. I haven‚Äôt spoken to my mom in 8 months and while I am wracked with near-constant guilt (hoping that eases with time), I knew that I hit a breaking point and had to focus on taking care of ME. At first it feels weird and wrong and selfish but the only person in this world who we can truly change or control, is ourselves. One thing I would say to myself is: ‚ÄúJust because she is a sinking ship and you love her, doesn‚Äôt mean you have to sink with her.‚Äù

I definitely think seeking out mental health resources for yourself is a great starting point. Maybe also speaking with your dad and sister about what it would look like to take space and how you could feasibly make that happen. It doesn‚Äôt need to be fully NC with your mom or forever, but in my experience space helps with healing, and is something to consider. 

Sending you so much love. üíô"
an infps thoughts on entps,12,mbti,"Im just going to to keep it short and sweet, thank you.

Not many people are kind enough to say these things and not many more are willing to express these feelings and state them, i genuinely appreciate your care you put in and i hope you have a fantastic day after reading this
I‚Äôm generally against stereotypes and generalizations (I just went on a multi-comment long tirade against a post here that particularly peeved me off), but you understand functions and I think your observations are more accurate than they aren‚Äôt, so thanks for writing this out! I think this is a great way to make understanding MBTI types more digestible for people, at least on an introductory level, but I think it‚Äôs often gone about in the wrong way
Yes, so true with my ENTP bestie too :)

I also just love protecting and being around for him.
As I've always said, INFPs are such beautiful souls and do get us.

Thank you.
You must be pretty intellectually free if you have so many ENTP‚Äôs at your door step. A lot of us are selective and resent unnecessary stupidity, like people who make generally bad decisions without self awareness. 

And to your statement about ENTP‚Äôs being selfless. One thing I hate about being misunderstood, is being viewed as someone that you wouldn‚Äôt go to for comfort. I love helping, listening and tell people nice things. Not the even the praise that comes after it."
