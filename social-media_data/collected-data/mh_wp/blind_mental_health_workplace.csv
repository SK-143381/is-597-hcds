I'm legally blind. I keep being rejected for jobs in the field of mental health when I mention during interviews that I (obviously!) cannot drive a car to transport clients when needed.,58,Blind,"Hey, my visual impairment is the same as yours (no vision + 20/200) and I’ve completed graduate school and am a licensed mental health worker (which by the way I had no trouble getting a job with my graduate degree as I wanted to outpatient office based therapy).  Before I went to grad school after undergrad I went through the state (Oregon at the time) rehabilitation services.  I got a job through them, and here’s the big one, a great scholarship that helped pay for grad school. And while it wasn’t all sunshine and roses working with them it is definitely worth looking into.  Best of luck! And feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the mental health field that I might be able to help with :)
Im so sorry. This sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening. Have you considered applying to one of the online mental health services like talkspace?
When I was sighted I worked in mental health, specifically forensics.  Psych hospitals and residential facilities in the community.

I know it's not something you want to hear, but I can understand where they are coming from, when they require a driving licence.

Your job as mental health support, is to assist the clients with activities they cannot do and assist them in daily living activities.  Especially if you are working 1-1.

>Every place I have applied to requires a driver's license to transport clients to medical appointments, community outings, etc.

It's a big part of the job.  Just because it's a residential facility doesn't mean they are stuck inside all day.  You could be taking them to shop for new clothes, a walk in the park, or any other number of activities that require travel.

If you have a disability that prevents you from adequate assisting/facilitating the clients needs, that isn't fair on them.

If their mental health issues can cause them to lash out or act unpredictably, especially if they have poor impulse control when frustrated, it can put them at risk as well as yourself.  If you're alone with a client and they get violent, quite frankly you're fucked  if you're blind.

If they have a forensic history, you need to be able to read body language and facial expressions to stop certain situations before they start.  


At the end of the day the clients wellbeing is paramount.  I can understand your frustration but this is one area where I can see not employing someone who is blind is justifiable.
I'm in California about to start my masters in mental health counseling, but I wanted to reach out and see how things turned out for you. I know it's been a couple of years.
I would like to know more about your experience as a therapist who is blind. I noticed that you posted about it a few years ago. I am about to begin my master's degree in mental health counseling and would appreciate any advice or support you can offer.
My guess is cost.  When I worked in mental health any extra costs were tightly controlled.

Say you have 1 trip per day with a client, could be Drs, shopping, etc....

£10 each way is £20.

Say you have 4 staff members that can't drive (not just because of blindness), that's potentially £80/day or £560/week just on taxi/uber.

Due to low mental health funding, money is often pretty tight.

In the UK we have fairly decent public transport but managers would still complain about bus/train ticket costs."
Why is the world so unforgiving?,49,Blind,"Uhm, wow; I'm not sure where to start. You're a senior in high school, correct? Where are your parent(s) / guardian(s) in all this? I'm not sure how things work where you live but do you have an IEP and a vision teacher (when I was growing up I had a teacher that came in and had a class where I learned braille, O&M, how to do things independently, etc). It sounds like you could use some adult help advocating for you with the school administration and your teacher. By all means you should also advocate for yourself but having other people in your corner is a good thing and you shouldn't be ashamed to ask people that care about you to get involved for you. Some teachers / people just suck and hopefully you get through her class and never have to have her teach you again.

..I can relate to a lot of what you said. Having aniridia, especially when i was younger and my vision was much better than it is now, my visual impairmenr/legal blindness was largely invisible to people, and in a way I never really fit in and was somewhere alone in between the sighted and non sighted worlds. Honestly it kinda fucking sucks and certainly didn't help my mental health lol.

Have you gotten the chance to meet other visually impaired and blind people your age? I remember going to summer camps that were just for those groups and it being fun and a good learning experience. I also got to go to space camp when I was little with other kids like me and it was really cool.

I feel you on the privileges thing, sighted people are way more privileged than they will ever realize or admit and a lot of people just suck and are ableist peices of shit. The number of people that can't drive for shit and don't know the right of way laws from their own ass makes my blood boil knowing that I know how to drive and can't yet these fuckers can and don't know how putting other peoples lives in danger because they don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves just pisses me off so much---anyways! Before I keep ranting lol.

I think that everyone learns differently and you just have to find the ways that work for you. You putting in the work is what matters and so long as you pass a certain grade isn't forever and won't hold you back in life--especially in college you'll find that some professors are easy graders, most are fair and follow the rubric, and some teachers are just impossible with their grading and expectations. You will get out of your degree what you put into it and the skills of how you do that are more important than what grade you get. What I'm trying to say is don't beat yourself up too much and try not to overstress. Try for great grades certainly but at the end of the day be kind to yourself.

I have seen some amazing people in this world and I don't think any career ambitions are necessarily out of the question simply because you are blind. I'm not sure what your career ambitions are but you should definitely do your research and try to connect with blind people that have been where you want to go. I think having examples and finding a mentor would be greatly beneficial to you. If you do have a vision itinerant or whatever they are called in your area definitely ask then for help finding a mentor, they have access to resources and can help you make connections / network.

Best of luck and don't give up. You need your right now.
I'm so sorry that this has happened to you.

None of this is your fault, and there is nothing lacking within yourself. People behave this way when they lack the ability to empathise, and/or refuse to educate themselves properly. As a teacher, they definitely ought to be doing so.

I do not think you are mentally unstable, I think you are a human being struggling with circumstances most cannot understand. School is hard enough without extra needs and challenges to overcome, but I do worry about the impact this could have on your mental health.

Is there someone you can trust and talk to? And does your school have any support for students with extra needs? Ideally there would be a way to report all of this and have it dealt with, but I am unsure about how the school system where you are operates.

For what it's worth you have talent, and you are capable of seeing the world very clearly (so to speak, I apologise). I hope that things improve for you!"
Eight years of total blindness and I'm yet to find a reason to live,49,Blind,"Well if I have ADHD, it hasn't been diagnosed yet, and I've been through a lot of mental health specialists during the last 8 years.  I've also Googled ADHD and at least the description in the featured snippet doesn't sound like me at all.  I'm not impulsive, don't struggle with paying attention, attempt to predict the outcome of all my actions, and am not very energetic.  The reason why I used to play games was twofold: I liked to immerse myself in another reality and be the hero in single-player games and I liked to help others achieve their objectives in cooperative multi-player games.

As for my motivation, I lose it because I can't perform as well as I like.  For example I just bought another Raspberry Pi along with its official touchscreen despite being totally blind because I want to play around with computer graphics on Linux and want to dedicate my first Pi to serve content on the Internet, however I will most likely get demotivated once the project for which I bought it is near completion because little things that I cannot pay attention to due to being blind will affect the final experience and I will only learn about them too late.  I've been through this before, but keep acting like I still have sight or this time it will be different.

I'm a creative person, and attention to detail used to characterize me.  My goal in life used to be to provide memorable experiences that people could feel unconsciously even if they couldn't appreciate.  I feel good not when people compliment me but rather when they try the same kind of product made by someone else and complain about things they hadn't even thought about while using my creations, and to that end I don't mind to put more effort into making things than most would, but I also expect quality as a result.  The problem is that right now my extra effort is only compensating for my disability, and in addition I think I've reached a plateau from which I cannot progress no matter how hard I work."
Respectful boundary communication with a blind person,33,Blind,"No cheating. Sex is off the table. I think his partner has mental health issues and that is probably the reason.

He had recently completed training with an Orientation and Mobility trainer but he grew up in a wealthier family and I think he is a bit used to people being at his service. I do not intend on doing that.
I understand the feeling of not wanting to be a burden but the world is changing and a lot of people are trying to learn to be more understanding and supportive of people with disabilities. I see this in academia and at the workplace and also among discussions with friends. For me, if I am hanging out with a blind person at a restaurant I don't mind helping get to the sit, reading you the menu (I actually like discussing the menu), walking you to the restroom or getting a glass of water for you. Those are simple things that are more or less basic needs."
about to be 14 and starting to realise the negatives of my disability,31,Blind,I teach kids how to use canes for a living. I can’t imagine anyone using one for attention or anyone thinking you’d do that. If someone accuses you of doing that I would assume that they are seriously struggling with their mental health and that has more to do with them than you. So try not to worry about that too much. But I know it’s a big adjustment and just another thing to be self conscious about…My advice to you is to embrace it. Rock the cane! People will be jealous of your confidence. Anyone who gives you shit for it or makes you feel bad doesn’t deserve to be in your life. Hope this helps.
How To Be Blind (a tutorial),30,Blind,"I, also, do not have many friends. Or more accurately, I do not have many friends outside of the blind community. And of course, even within the community, there is this, fear, of saying too much. I recognize that I am one of the luckier ones, in the sense that all I have known is blindness. I never lost something. For me, one of the most difficult aspects of it all is the mystery of my diagnosis. I am an adopted child, and the director of the orphanage created a fake record for me less than a year before the adoption. It is strange, I know many blind children who were adopted from China at an older age. For me, it comes with a different sort of... pressure to withhold my complaints. My mother told me that the director of the orphanage questioned her for a long time, asking why she really wanted a blind child. They knew exactly what they were getting into. I know, I was wanted. A strange thing for which to harbor any other emotions save gratitude and happiness. They knew that adjustments would have to be made; they were aware of the logistic challenges. But as I grapple with watching my sighted sister spread her wings and fly, while I remain grounded by limitations that I cannot change, and a splintering mental health, I always wonder, did they really know what they were getting into? I wonder how many blind people are unhappy, but refuse to recognize or attribute it to being blind for some reason or another. We are given canes and taught to cross streets. We are taught daily living skills while feeling inferior for having to be specifically instructed. We watch people drive, run independently, make eye contact, and there is a part, of me at any rate, that wants to make a venn diagram and show my parents, people in general, that they don't get it. People think it simple jealousy, petty lack of willingness to accept reality. You know those times where you set something down and can't find it? You know it's right there. Or when something, like a sheaf of papers, falls, and you wonder if you have gotten all of them, but if you haven't you should keep feeling, and if you have you are wasting your time... 
And all of this to circle back to complaining. Biting my tongue is a skill I have learned, at least when it comes to my blindness and how I feel, when talking to sighted people. I know that I use the term sighted people very loosely. I am sorry if I offend anyone; I understand that there are many people who try, very hard, to understand. Please forgive me.
My original point was simply to say, please, feel free to PM me, whether it is to complain, to revisit a past that people are telling you to move on from... I am always here to listen, perhaps because I know what it is to repress everything, and when it comes out, that feeling of being a burden. 
I am sorry if this was a disjointed compilation of too many words and too little sense."
How is your mental health?,23,Blind,"I was born blind, premature by a number of months. The oxygen needed to keep my brain going was fatal to my retinas, and so I have had no useful vision all my life.

I was very lucky apart from that, though. Despite an apathetic set of parents who didn’t care to get involved with any blind adaptations or organisations and indeed who made it quite clear they didn’t intend to have me and it was my younger, sighted siblings who were the wanted children, I thrived as a child. I was well-supported in education, I made friends. Yes, I became one of the nerds, but the nerds were a group of their own. I didn’t need respect from the whole student body, I was used to not having it from my own parents, after all. I found my niche and settled in, and learning became my thing, backed by technology.

For a decade and a half, this worked well. I grew. I learned. I found ways of understanding things I couldn’t interpret. Proving the existence of clouds to my satisfaction meant a trip in a hot air balloon, because I couldn’t see them and other empirical tests – like covering the sun with another object – didn’t satisfy me. I was curious, polite, inquisitive and excited by the potentials offered by technology to improve my own lot in life, and happy to use my blindness as a teaching tool for others. It became a true part of me, rather than something apart from me. I embraced it. 

Mental health wasn’t on my RADAR at that point. My own health had never brought up any questions in that regard: I’d fallen out of trees and smashed my head on rocks, sprained things and pulled muscles, but nothing other than the physical. The first time I ever really felt that my blindness was a problem was a day when my sighted friends began to take off on their bikes, leaving me behind. I’d been involved in everything else up to that point, and standing outside school, hearing the tick tick tick of their bicycles fading into the distance was the first time I had a bitter upswelling of envy for those who could do what I couldn’t.

I went home. I dialed up to the online bulletin board systems and Multi-user dungeons I’d played for years and marauded my high-level characters through dangerous areas, the thrill of being good at something I’d worked hard for counterbalancing the emotions dredged up by being abandoned. After I’d cooled down, I realized that, for every trip they took out on their bikes, there’d still be more to the cinema, or shops, or bowling alley, just like all the other times. Cross-country biking was an extra to the things they did, not a replacement for the things we did.

My next real shock came when I moved from school to college. I’d had regular access to a sighted assistant up to this point: I’d not needed it often, particularly as I grew more confident in my own use of technology, and the fact that I was left alone by them much of the time served me well in bonding with my sighted peers. Still, the safety net of them being there, plus their ability to fight for accessible work or to adapt it ready for lessons, was a crutch I didn’t know I needed. The 2 years at college without such a level of support was grueling. Being handed print textbooks at the start of a lesson and told to use them like everyone else was … eye-openingly impossible, and began to make me realise just how ablest the word could be, although that word didn’t really enter my vocabulary at that point.

This pattern was to repeat itself throughout my life. For every one job interview I attended in hope, perhaps five or six people turned me away with legitimate-sounding reasons for not employing me, thinly veiling the fact that the real reason was my blindness. Legally, they couldn’t say it, but as a practical matter, if two people apply for the same job and one requires less adaptations or changes to existing working systems, most of the time, the disabled person loses.

Despite all this, I was resolute in my blind happiness. I’d known no different, after all. Seeing was a concept to me, not a way of life. I would have happily given away physical parts of my eyes to help other people see more clearly if medically feasible.  And then we had a child.

Another pivotal moment came during my child’s toddler days. She was an articulate child – she had to be, pointing at things and making noises didn’t get her anywhere. We walked into a fast-food restaurant during the school holidays. I remember vividly the flood of warm air as we crossed the threshold, the roar of noisy voices, the clangor of diners ordering and eating and playing, kids screaming, parents shouting. And us waiting to be seated in all that, and me knowing intellectually that my daughter was only a few small footsteps away from me yet utterly cut off, aurally, from my senses.   This was the point at which I really began to want vision. Getting on or off the right bus, knowing precisely if I was about to walk into the correct building or room, being assured of my place in line – these had all been things I’d previously struggled with whilst out-and-about with my child, where just a little bit of vision could have helped.  I’d grumbled a little about them internally, but accepted it as part of my life. And this entry into the furor of the restaurant tipped me into thinking that, even the smallest chance of some vision, medically, mechanically, computationally or however, would be something to jump at.

This burning desire has faded as my daughter has grown older. The more I’ve done with her, the more independent I have become and the more ability and understanding she has developed, the need has become less pressing. I was already very happy to use technology to aid me, and that’s only gotten better with time. When we left college as a couple, reading print letters required a flatbed scanner and desktop computer arrangement, taking up half our living room and minutes to read a sheet of paper. Now, I can flip through a handful of letters, point them at the camera poking out of my shirt pocket, and have them sorted by recipient before I’ve finished walking through my house. The ability to read handwriting came next, smashing the barrier of identifying who sent us Christmas cards and bringing a major upswing to my efficiency in the office (yes, my colleagues can now leave handwritten post-it notes on my desk). And just this week, we’ve sent our daughter off on a school trip and I am actually looking forward to the photos she’ll send back from her phone, because of the descriptive abilities of the large language models we now have access to. 

For me, blindness is an inextricable part of who I am. I work in the field of visual impairment. I play adapted sports. I read on a Braille display rather than an eInk kindle, although I am always careful to point out that the source material I read is now the same as everyone else’s, just on a different screen. This is a far cry from my own school days, when putting a book into Braille meant physical, mechanical  labour. Being a computer programmer has undeniably helped me through life – I’ve written dozens of tools for my own edification over the years.  And it is that comfort with and power of technology that I think is my mental life line. I am fortunate beyond my wildest imaginings as a teen. If You’d told my 16-year-old self that he would be able to access handwritten notes at work, or comprehend pictures from holiday snaps, he would have laughed at you. ‘No way’, I’d have said. ‘Blind people can’t access that sort of thing.’

I’d have been right, of course. But things change. And the pace of change has never been greater. And this is what keeps me going. The time I’d spend wallowing in misery would be time I could miss these potential breakthroughs. And so for every little niggle of inaccessibility, for every bump along the road, I think about the road ahead. If I can hop over that bump or smoothen out that wrinkle, what might lie over the horizon?  I could no more have predicted the things I can do now back then than I can predict what access I will have a decade from now. But I do know that, if I persist in living a happy and healthy life, engaged with the blind community, using my technological skills to help other people whilst earning a living and bringing up my child to appreciate that a disability isn’t a lack of ability in other areas, I can cope.

Times are hugely tough right now. My income hasn’t gone up, but the bills have. Just this month the mortgage has jumped up by nearly a third. Electricity, heating and food are also on the rise. None of it is blind related, but all of it impacts how much disposable income we have, and that is blindy – because the money we use on taxis and the extra costs of blindness has become squeezed. I guess we just have to remain careful and cautious, pick our way through the difficulties as best we can. But not lose sight of the fact that seeing is by no means necessary to live a happy, productive life in 2023 in this country, and that is something I am very grateful for.
I'm 41, and My mental health was great until I went totally blind 9 years ago, because as long as I had sight, and even though I only had 10% acuity, there were still things, like playing video-games and coding, that I could still do completely unhindered and where I could feel normal. I also led a fully independent life where my only annoyance was that my employer only let me work from home on Thursdays (this was 15 years before COVID made remote work more prevalent). Then I went blind and had a 5 year long dark period in which all I wanted was to die, and even went through a single psychotic break which ended up with me locked up in a psychiatric hospital for 3 weeks due to being considered a danger to myself. While I never actually tried to kill myself, because I was always afraid of surviving a suicide attempt and ending up with even more disabilities, if there was such a thing as a pill that I could take to end my life I would have taken it back then and would still take it right now. That said these days I try to make the best of the hand that life dealt me, and am eagerly yet patiently waiting for my natural or accidental death, or an opportunity to safely exit life.

What made me recover from the darkest times of my life was the realization that I could still code blind as well as the normalization of my current condition. I can still remember how great life was back then, and would love to return to those days, but for some reason, the more time passes, the more I tend to think of my former sighted days as dreams. Able and healthy people don't even realize how incredibly lucky they are, and to be honest I get a little infuriated with the fact that so many healthy people waste away their lifes with futility instead of investing into self development and into making the world a better place.
I’m 25. A lot of issues have been piling up over the last few weeks that affected my mental health mentally. A lot of these issues come from the visual impairment and I feel a little defeated
I’m 62 and was just recently diagnosed as legally blind. The disease is progressive and there’s nothing to be done. 

I already had mental health challenges. Now I am going through the five stages of grief as I lose my vision. I hate losing my independence. I’m hoping to find group therapy to talk to other people about this.

I’m sorry you’re struggling. I am too.
I’m 23 and recently lost a significant amount of vision due to a illness… My mental health is not good at all currently it happened six months ago and I’m still reeling from it. My life has been completely flipped upside down. I don’t know what to do there’s no resources where I live. I can’t drive anymore. I can’t do anything that I wanted to do or had planned to do with my life because of this and honestly Every day I wish that I never woke up… The only thing keeping me together is my family I guess… But everyone’s getting sick of me complaining and being depressed I’m sure I don’t even know what to do. I really hate it here… A piece of me is still holding out hope that something will change, but another part of me is like I need to be realistic and except this is the life I live… I DK how much longer I’m gonna be here, but I’m gonna hold on until I can’t any longer.
Well, I’d say my mental health is stable now, but I’ve had my ups and downs not only because of my blindness, but also because of my upbringing, and the fact that I have been moving from country to country beginning my teenage years, which has left me with no physical friends, and a bunch of good long-distance friends.  I am definitely successful academically, but the isolation that comes with blindness really sucks. Now  20 years old in college I have managed to come to terms with it by reading a lot and playing video games when accessible. Recently, after a long search, just found a quasi job and will use part of the money that I will be making there to travel around to meet up with my lomg-distance friends to see if I can find life a little more enjoyable lol
Mental health? In this economy?!
Wait you guys have good mental health
Who had a great metaphor bench, pressing mental health"
Looking for genuine friends and a support system,20,Blind,"Have you already checked out the r/blind Discord?

Mental health, I'd say, is a struggle for all of us who had vision and lost it. I know my first year, maybe two years was the lowest point I had after almost a decade of becoming healthier, mentally and emotionally.

I lucked out a bit and found a Reddit stranger that helped me through it. Hope that you find one too and you're welcome to reach out over PM. I don't use Reddit chat because it lacks notifications on the browser so I may go days before realizing there are waiting chats."
How To Help My Blind Friend,20,Blind,"Wow, sounds like you're an amazing and thoughtful friend and it's evident you really care about her well-being. With that said, you're exhausted because you're taking on the work of two people, and that's not fair or sustainable. Good for you for recognizing that things need to change so that you can maintain your friendship while making sure that one person isn't carrying the load for all the practical/logistics side of things. 

While some of what you've described does come down to a lack of blindness skills, I think the bigger issue is anxiety and a lack of confidence in her own abilities, so maybe that's the place to start. She knows how to use the machine to pay for things, but gets anxious and asks you to do it. She gets upset and anxious if you ignore her requests for help. She has an app for reading labels, but asks you to do it instead. All of these things are tasks she has demonstrated the capability to do, so it's not really about skill. You can teach her over and over and over again, but if her lack of knowledge isn't the problem, you're getting nowhere and becoming more and more frustrated in the process. 

Some of these things will be beyond your ability to address. While it's great that you're there for emotional support, calming her down and soothing her anxiety all the time is a different thing entirely. Working through this with a mental health professional will help her to get to the root of what's going on in her life and empower her to make changes. It won't be easy, but it will be so worth it. A therapist or other professional can talk through the things she's struggling with emotionally, plus they can determine if there's an imbalance that meds could help with. If nothing else, it can really help to have an outside perspective, because things have been this way for so long that it's difficult for her to even imagine how they could be different. 

Others have given some great suggestions about making sure she's connected with any blindness services she might need, like a training center or an o&m instructor. While that's happening, think about some small but significant things you both could do to change things in the household. The first step is to sit down and talk about things, at a point when you're both in a good headspace. She needs to know that you truly do love her, but things can't continue this way. She needs to know you believe in her, maybe more than she believes in herself right now. She may become upset or defensive, which in no way means you have done something wrong and should drop it. 

Once you've really got an open conversation going, you could start by making an agreement together on something small that you'll work on. An example might be her makeup. Let's say you've taught her, or she's learned from a tutorial, how to put on her lipstick. You could agree together that if she'd like you to do her makeup that day, she'll do the lipstick. If she's not feeling comfortable or confident enough when the time comes, you could be gently encouraging and supportive without actually stepping in to do all the makeup that day like you always have done before. If it turns out she doesn't wear any that day, no one is harmed and it's not the end of the world, but an important boundary has been established. 

I wish you both all the best in navigating this, and no matter what happens, please do take some time for yourself. You deserve it!
I have to agree. I'm not blind or considered visually impaired (joined the sub as have some vision loss that can't be corrected) so I can't speak from that perspective but have worked in mental health and with people with varying levels of vision. I have to agree that this sounds like a confidence or mental health thing. It sounds like she's feeling vulnerable or insecure so is asking for help with things she's capable of as a way of getting the reassurance she feels she needs to feel more safe and secure.

Once you've started helping someone in this way it can feel tricky to reset the boundaries but if it can be done in a way that demonstrates kindness and compassion I think that would be really helpful in promoting her confidence and create a healthier relationship for them both."
Neighbour making my home unsafe for my guide dog. Not sure what’s for the best.,19,Blind,Oh he sounds delightful! Not! 🙄 Some people are just so inconsiderate. To some extent it doesn't matter how minor the behaviour is if it's frequent enough then it can still have a huge impact on someone's mental health. Hopefully we can have a nice peaceful future!
"It's been 5 years since I lost my kitty, I miss her till this day should I get myself another cat. Do pets help with mental health",16,Blind,"Pets often help with mental health as long as caring for them is not an excessive burden such as financial, time, personality mismatch, et cetera.  Cats are my favorite.
My animals give me purpose in life, so I'd certainly say they improve mental health!  

It is currently kitten season - that time of year when shelters are overflowing with kittens. You could volunteer to help socialize new kittens at the shelters if you're unsure about adopting.
I'm very sorry for your loss and can definitely sympathize that grief can last a very long time.

In general, the advice I've heard is that yes, assuming finances and other circumstances permit, you should get another pet. It doesn't have to replace your previous cat whom you can still continue to love and remember fondly, but it'll be a new companion and pets help humans cope with life in a bewildering variety of ways.

With pets you also don't have to worry as much if you're still processing some emotions. For example, if you rushed into another relationship with a human partner but still hadn't processed the emotions from your previous partner, you're bound to cause some confusion and hurt feelings for both of you, but this doesn't apply to pets as long as you love and care for them.

Take some time, find a cat you really click with, and enjoy your new companion.

Edit: and yes, pets most definitely help with mental health."
Dealing with the overwhelmingness - How?,15,Blind,"I'm 39 years old and currently unemployed. Lost my job earlier this year and been looking for work, unsuccessfully.

So far, the only visual rehab center in town has yet to see fit to provide me any sort of training. Almost feels like no one there is taking me seriously. I haven't seen any counselors, either.

If it was just my Dad I was living with, I think things would be much better. My Mom, on the other hand, is a handful. She is always over extending herself to help me out unnecessarily and gets offended if I say something. I wish I could live on my own, but no income right now and still waiting on SSDI to make a decision.

I'm hoping going to college this fall will help out my mental health. Being stuck at home more than I'm used to really sucks."
Is there a such thing as disability mental health therapists?,16,Blind,"I think the thing to keep in mind here is that being disabled doesn't have to mean it's now impossible for you to do X or Y, but that maybe you'll need to find a different way to still do X or Y. That sounds easier said than done, I know, and that mountain looks super high from where you're standing. But you've already started that process by reaching out for advice.

Life skills and O&M don't sound like much on their own, but think of it like this. You've already got life and O&M training. But you got it as a sighted person. It's not that you don't know where you're going or what you're doing. It's that you don't know how to do it without relying on sight. The life skills training and the O&M training is there to teach you how to do it without site--which, yes absolutely, will help you to regain your confidence and in turn help improve your mental health.

It's not an overnight process by any means. But it's definitely a doable process. What that doable process looks like for you... that's what you're needing to learn, now."
Do any other visually impaired people feel like they have some cognitive issues from over-tiredness?,18,Blind,"I've been on and off medication for mental health issues since I was 13, so I absolutely understand how you feel, at least to an extent one can. The other day I cried for 20 minutes because we got the wrong ice cream at the grocery store, which is not an appropriate reaction to ice cream. Please know you have the sympathy and emotional support of this internet stranger."
Mother is having trouble adjusting to life with low vision,16,Blind,"I lost a significant portion of my vision at 37 after a medical emergency.  Has your mom seen a low vision specialist?  If not, then she definitely should.  Mine hooked me up with all types of resources.  

Has she contacted her state's (assuming you are in the US) organization for the blind and visually impaired?  Our's is wonderful and offered Orientation and Mobility Training and assistance with training on and accessing assistive tech.

iOS and Android both offer a ton of accessibility features for the visually impaired.  However, there is a learning curve, and I think it is additionally frustrating if you over-rely on your remaining vision.  I learned a lot by looking up YouTube videos on Talkback for Android and I'm sure there are similar content available for iOS.

I can navigate (mostly) by sight in most situations by sight, but I do use a white cane in large crowds and in situations like when there might be a lot of stairs or terrain changes.  She could use one as what's called an ID cane which is not for navigation per se, but rather to communicate to others she is visually impaired.  

Finally, she should definitely seek mental health counseling.  With all she's been through, she probably needs it.  It took me a little over a year to fully process my vision loss and I'm still learning what the new normal is.  The things we do often we relearn quickly, but there's things pop up all the time and I'm like ""I can't do this the same way as I used to.""  It takes time to adjust.  Good luck and best wishes to for your mom."
My boyfriend has Retinitis Pigmentosa and I’m anxious about the future,14,Blind,"I'll keep this brief for now because I dobut it's the answer your looking for but:    
I've been married for ten years and an unemployed due not only to my blindness but other physical and mental health issues.    
Yet, we love one another so much that we've become insuperable over the years.  She works a fulltime job and I keep the house.  During the height of the U.S.  quarantine she worked at home for two months.  We had our ups and downs but when she was called back to work it was depressing for both of us -- overall,  we enjoyed the time we got to spend together at home.      


If your boyfriend's blindness does become severe enough that he can't work then there's several variables in the relationship that need to be addressed:     
1)  Can he be considered for disability which may offset some financial stresses?    
2)  Can you two still connect on an emotional/personal level even if he's blind or severely visually impaired?    
3) Does he have meaningful hobbies or secondary interest that could occupy his time if he cannot work?  This is important for him because otherwise he could become depressed and reclusive.    
4) Can you assist him/ or you willing to assist him in certain task?    
5) Are you or him willing to redefine not only your relationship but your future lifestyle together?    


Also, not to offend you at all,  but please keep his personal well being in mind and make sure he's not going to slip into a depressive or self-destructive funk.  It's important you both be honest and realistic but also open to change.     


Oftentimes, we have preconceived notions of what life and relationships and our futures should be but it's like that ol' addage:  If you wanna make god laugh -- make plans for the future.     


You've both got the journey of life before you  --  there is no right or wrong answer."
New glasses!,14,Blind,"Thank you, I've spent all day stressing about going out tonight and what it might mean for my future. I'm not so worried about me but about other peoples reactions. I've had drs blame some very obvious problems on my mental health before like I was told my continence issues were unrelated to the organ falling outside my body. I'm worrying this will be another thing they choose to build into something it's not. I'm doing all this while at the same time knowing that it might not even be an issue, maybe these glasses have done the trick. But hopefully by the time I tuck myself into bed tonight I'll have the experience/information I need to decide what I need to do going forward. I just want to feel safe and have a reference point of where I am being that a sliver of curb or a drain cover catching the light or that be a cane telling me where the edge of the path is. In myself I don't really care as long as I can still go out when I need to. It's the worrying about other people that's getting to me at this stage."
Going blind maybe. How to cope learn skills and handling emotional issues,14,Blind,"Not sure if you have other symptoms as well, but when I was tested for MS I was asked about double vision and eye issues. Hopefully it’s not that, but something to look into if your doctors haven’t already.

I have keratoconus and have had issues with my vision progressively degrading since my late teens. I was finally diagnosed in my late 20s and it was devastating knowing my eyes would continue to get worse as I aged and that I would likely need surgical procedures in the future. Up until I was able to start seeing doctors who understood the disease, eye exams always resulted in emotional breakdowns from frustration and a feeling of loss.

I highly recommend getting into therapy if you aren’t already. Talking about things coming up as you learn to cope and adjust can help. Finding online communities of people dealing with similar conditions also helped me. Look for groups that are helpful, constructive, and mostly positive. Venting is helpful and sometimes informative for others, but I’ve seen a lot of chronic pain groups devolve into competitive pity parties, “life is terrible” posts, and overwhelmingly depressing environments. If I notice anything like that, I move on for my own mental health.

As far as technology, I use larger computer screens at work and increase font sizes. I set the brightness and contrast so I can see better. I always make sure rooms I’m in regularly and can control have bright enough lighting since I have issues with seeing in the dark. I’ve mostly given up driving unless absolutely necessary, especially at night. What you need may be different, but there are settings and computer themes you can use to help better with your challenges.

I use blue light filters on my phone to remove blue light, especially at night, to avoid eye strain. Voice to text is a lifesaver at times. 

For eye health, I see my eye doctors for routine checks at least yearly to make sure the rest of my eye health is still good, since my mom found out she had glaucoma around my age. I also make sure to wear sunglasses when I’m outside for UV protection.

I hope you can figure out what is going on with your vision and wish you the best on your journey. I don’t know if any of this has been helpful with your condition, but I hope it’s given you some ideas and hope that you can get through it. Know you aren’t alone."
Recently diagnosed w/ RP,15,Blind,"hello! and welcome. I feel your pain. also 24 but I got diagnosed at 14. keep some hope. science is progressing to unfathomable levels. sci fi cant even cover it. 

as for mental health. grab a psychiatrist asap."
"It’s mental health awareness week in the UK and I made a video sharing my thoughts. I’m severely visually impaired and no stranger to mental health struggles. So, I hope this resonates with you, too.",14,Blind,"I also want to compliment your voice, it's very calm and nice to listen to! 

I am working in the mental health field and studying to become a therapist at the moment.  I really believe that in this time of loneliness having someone to talk to and openly, comfortably speaking about what's going on in your mind can go a very long way. But sometimes you just don't have such a person in your life at the current time, maybe you moved to a new city and barely know anyone. Or you started college and lost connection to most of your highschool friends.it can be hard to find that one person that you can open up to.

I don't think most of these people necessarily need a therapist, often a friend can help them just as much. But therapists are there to help you if you feel like you need someone, and it doesn't make you crazy or mentally ill. Unfortunately these are still existing stigmas arround therapy, especially in the Asian countries. It is not wrong to seek help if you need it, it's a sign of strength not weakness"
Dealing with paranoia while blind,11,Blind,"This is a tough one. I've got paranoia in large part because people do watch me when I'm out, they like seeing a blind person doing the thing. I think a big part of managing it is just knowing that you're prone to this kind of thinking and doing what you can within reason to be safe when you go out. Most people are not going to hurt you even if they are watching you, and it can be to your advantage that people are watching because if something does start to happen there are more witnesses to it. Keeping an eye on your mental health for the day is important too. I have days where I know I may not be able to go to some places because I'm just too keyed up. I do a lot of planning ahead too, but that's a general blind life thing; you kinda have to know where you're going and how you're going to get around at that place and then get home."
Seeking psychiatric help,13,Blind,"I've often said going blind is hard but being blind is easy.

Day to day life as a blind man has been way better than I expected but going through all the emotions and grieving that comes with the diagnosis was hell.

And nobody helped. Nobody explained the profound sense of loss I was about to experience. Nobody warned me how much it hurt to realize some of my dreams would never come true. Nobody told me about the jealousy and the anger and the depression in store.

All they told me was ""Call this number for a free white cane.""

It turns out most ophthalmologists don't understand the grief we go through. They aren't trained to deal with it and if we don't bring it up they don't bring it up, either.

It's a little messed up, isn't it? We're handed a life changing diagnosis and just assumed to take it in stride.

The truth is I'd be more worried about someone who didn't have a gut wrenching emotional reaction to learning they're going blind. Anybody who can lose their job and their driver's license and their hope for the future and NOT need a therapist to discuss the turning of their world upside down is scary.

Mental health counseling should be part of the diagnosis. It's unreasonable to expect us to not get messed up when we hear it. But it's not. We have to bring it up to our eye doctors to get a referral or we have to find a therapist ourselves.

I guess this is my way of saying I sympathize, I get it, and you're not alone.

There are counselors who specialize in disabilities and in grief. Hopefully someone in this thread recommends a good one in South Carolina to you,

In the meantime my DMs are always open and I'll link you to the blog posts where I write about figuring my own way through the grief and loss.
Others have addressed things well I just wanted to mention that you may be experiencing Charles Bonette Syndrome, a form of hallucinations created by the eye itself when vision is changing. It was first noticed in cataract patients but it can happen to anyone with enough vision loss. I have it and it took two retinal specialists to tell me what it was; it flares up worse when I'm sick or stressed. If the things you're seeing in the periphery of your vision are consistent, always in the same spot, and it's been going on for awhile, it may be Charles Bonett Syndrome, which isn't dangerous but it is annoying as hell heh. 

And I second what's been said elsewhere here. Going blind sucks hardcore, being blind isn't so bad once you get used to it. I think you may be eligible now for services like Medicaid and Social Security Income and if you can get on any of those you may have better help finding some mental health coverage.
It don’t have practical advice about your mental health question, except to say that I’ve found brief counseling sessions very helpful. With the state of our health care system, I think anyone seeking medical treatment would benefit from counseling support. Maybe look into a teledoc as a first step, if you have access.

I wanted to mention, though, that what you describe sounds somewhat like the visual aura that can accompany migraine in a couple of key ways:
- Visual aura often begin with the peripheral vision, and can be accompanied by other peripheral effects like tunnel vision.
- Mine typically progress to what I can only describe as flashy light worms that dance around my central vision.
- It’s fairly common for migraine sufferers to wake up with the symptoms. They can also be triggered by the whole long list of migraine triggers, from smells & foods to hormonal shifts, sleep deprivation, or stress.
- They aren’t always accompanied by migraine pain. I had weird (& upsetting) aural symptoms for a few years before ever experiencing my first migraine headache. They did, however, respond to migraine medication or sleep.

The Wikipedia article on Scintillating Scotoma has some reasonable artistic renderings of what they look like, although none of them are exactly what I see. Check it out and see if they look familiar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma"
"Looking for support, been visually impaired & a braille reader all my life, used to have some usable sight, lost everything several years ago and still struggling with living in total darkness.",13,Blind,"I was lucky enough to find a great mental health counselor that helped me reinforce using my tools to cope wit vision loss, have you ever tried it?"
Toxicity in the blind community,12,Blind,"My personal policy, to preserve mental health, is blind friends online, sighted friends offline.  There are a lot of really wonderful blindness communities online, like this one.  However, as soon as you bring these communities into the ""real world"", you get nothing but drama.  Plus, the fact that most sighted folks post nothing but images online these days means that interacting with them over the internet is not rewarding.  So I'd rather spend the time strengthening my sighted friendships offline.  "
