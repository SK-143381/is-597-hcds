"""You're on disability? Let me guess, depression and anxiety?""",928,disability,"Oh totally - I use a chair, am losing my hearing, but the mental health issues, especially SI are by far the worst bit. Hope you find some peace.
You look so lovely! love your dress, it suits you perfectly!

And thank you for helping me feel validated and less like a fraud. I’m on disability for multiple mental health reasons and sometimes o feel like my family, friends, and doctors look down on me for it but my therapist has been helping me combat that. Mental health issues can be debilitating and dangerous, I’m glad it’s a valid reason for disability even if it’s a hard battle to be approved.
I’m on disability for mental health reasons (panic disorder with agoraphobia). I just wanted to thank you for posting this. Mental health struggles are no less valid or debilitating. It makes me feel a bit less depressed to know that others (like yourself) understand.
Right! Like, I'm disabled for mental health reasons (ive been on it since i was 8) and its not like i just get a little sad and anxious sometimes. i have severe breakdowns when im under any sort of stress to the point that i could not work a full time job, even though i really wish i could!
I hate you Had To go Through with that. Just tired of ignorant Ableist people sometimes 

Yeah Your Reasons For being on Disability is Valid 

Just Made me Also think about my personal experience with people like that 

Like it makes me Very Sad that Some people don't understand 

How Much Non Visible as well as Visible Disabilities effects people 

Well for me I have Severe Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder 

And bipolar disorder and unspecified PTSD, And recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability 

Just get tired Of The Abled body making disability like the Olympics 

Like people have to compete with each other to see if they Disabilities are severe enough for disability 

Which true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function 

Which this does 

Which I have Agoraphobia I'm the opposite I can't Be Around people 

I can't even go to the Hospital without having a panic attack 

like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent 

Because I still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function 

Only time I leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult 

But I live alone don't really have support 

Since I look so Normal and functional unfortunately 

Plus people think because I'm a black man I'm immune to being disabled or having a disability 

Just kinda hard Because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community 

It effects me daily 

It's detrimental on my economic status 

It's hard to just text and talk on the phone 

Even right now I'm getting a headache 

But it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability 

Try to explain to ignorant people that are Ableist like you dealt with 

I'm quite the opposite I can't stay with people I would have a panic attack unfortunately 

It's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis 

Like they force you to share rooms which aggravates my disabilities.

And aggravates my anxiety PTSD symptoms as well 

Just everyones disability effects people differently 

Mines kinda severe to me 

Like Hate the Competition Thing abled body people created 

Sound like people have to compete with each other like freaking capitalism 

Just for Disability payments 

I hate that 

I wouldn't apply for disability if I didn't need it 

I felt so much guilt younger

People saying my disability is not severe because they can't see it 

Or people always assume you faking it 

Since mental illness they quote you can fake 

Which makes me very upset 

Because they will never know how I feel in my body and mind 

If only that knew they wouldn't be saying that 

And by the way Disability payments can't even cover Rent payments 

A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is over 1500$ for the worst area 

So probably pushing 2000$+ for a good area

Just make me upset and triggered 

Because I have no reason to make up how my disability effects my life daily 

People are so ignorant with mental illness 

They assume because I'm laughing at a movie 

Or taking a selfie 

I'm faking a mental illness 

Which makes me upset 

Like My therapist tells me to watch television using coping mechanisms to distract 

Like they don't know people with disabilities don't always have bad days 

Have a bunch of bad days 

Which I do but 

I like doing the coping mechanisms my therapist taught me 

Just make me cry a little 

Because Disabilities people can't understand what they can't see

Not trying to get emotional 

Just your post resonated with my life 

Bought up bad memories I guess 

Like people think because I workout 

Which is at home by the way 

I can't handle public commercial gyms by the way 

But people assume because I'm trying to use a coping mechanism 

To cope with my disability 

That means I'm faking it 

Or using reddit as a journal like now 

Which I'm anxious as well typing this 

Just people don't understand disabilities effect people differently 

Just Ableism in society 

Might not be to abled body person that has no problems leaving their house 

Or a person that doesn't feel like a lion is being chased after him for just talking or talking on a phone 

Like I live alone but my with my disability I couldn't live with people that would make my condition worse 

I had anxiety just living with family members 

Just because I live alone people think my mental health is not severe 

That really makes me upset 

Because Disabilities effects people differently 

Mines just as severe or life altering as anyone else 

Just because I live alone doesn't mean I'm independent 

I still can't keep a job and stuff 

I don't think being independent is until I can live a functioning life 

And people that have jobs still have disabilities 

Disability effects everyone differently 

I hate this grade scale stuff 

That Ableist people use to say you not deserving of help

Just Ableism sigh

Which I tell distant family and Ableist strangers on social media sites 

I don't have to live in a group home unfortunately 

Because my anxiety would get worse and turn to a crisis 

Just I really relate to your post op 

I guess I got triggered by you quoting Ableist people that said that to you 


But hate people feel like mental illness is not taking seriously 

Which I'm not physically disabled which I definitely respect and understand 

But speaking from a Ableist person perspective 

Like they think people with mental illness or other invisible disabilities 

Should not be considered for disability 

And they always say we lazy or faking because we lazy 

Which I would love to keep a stable job 

But capitalism doesn't value that capitalism values efficiency and profit 

And doesn't value disabled people fitting in 

Not trying to rant on capitalism because I know everyone opinions is different 

I would love to work it's just hard with my conditions

Because due to Ableism they really think People getting disability checks 

That doesn't even cover a full month of rent 

Is a luxury.

Which the Lowest paying minimum wage job pays more than disability pays people.

Like This effected me for a long time 

My whole life 

Just because it gets me emotional knowing because you don't see me walking in a cane or wheelchair 

Or a Down Syndrome or something more visible 

Like I don't have those conditions I'm still disabled as them 

Autism you can't see, learning disabilities you can't see

Even some physical illnesses are invisible 

Such as Sickle Cell and Lupus 

Everything is not visible like blindness 

But my mental illness effects my life as much as any other disability effects people lives in society 

Just because I have muscle or tall black and 6'2""

Keep myself groomed 

I guess I have to look unhoused to For people to understand how my disability effects me seriously 

It's so flawed 

Invisible Disabilities doesn't work like that unfortunately 

I'm deserving of disability as much as anyone that has a disability 

Sorry for the rant OP
Absolutely. I'm tired of the nonsense that mental health disabilities are less disabling or acceptable than physical.
Is it typically easier to get on disability via mental health or physical ?"
"Unpopular Opinion: I hate the toxic positivity in the disability community as a whole, of especially people who never knew what it was like to lose one or more of your senses, telling someone to not process their emotions. ",316,disability,"with severe PTSD I really struggle with the forced positivity from people who have less pervasive mental health issues. I'm glad your stuff can be solved with a CBT app and some exercise, but we're beyond that here bro
Ugh, nothing like having someone tell you that you can't wallow feeling sorry for yourself.    Yes, another person with a disability. 

Like, listen jackass, I literally became disabled overnight at 51 years old.  My old life and career are over.    Both my brother and father died in long, drawn-out illnesses right before and after.   My dad literally died 7 months after becoming disabled.     It takes some f***ing time to process.  Three years later, I still wake up shocked.  It's hard navigating a new life coupled with grief.   

I'm bipolar and work hard to maintain my mental health.  

   Anyone who can say something like that can fuck right off.     

Sorry.   Hits me right in the feels.


One of the most influential people in my life was Eric Gallegos, though I called him Pete. I met him when we both worked at a movie theater called Krikorian Theaters in Redlands, California. Pete was ten years older than me, and he played a significant role in bringing out the musical artist and writer within me.

At the time, I was a clean-cut, plain kid with no radical style. Pete, on the other hand, was the original goth-emo type—dark and poetic, yet incredibly down-to-earth, intelligent, fit, and usually happy-go-lucky. Despite the age difference, we became close friends, and even ten years later, we remained in touch.

Around that time, Pete had just gone through a tough divorce from his newlywed wife, which also led to a separation from his baby daughter. I was looking for a new place to live, so I moved in with him. Those were dark days for Pete as he coped with the loss and loneliness. He was a trip, I tell you. He even figured out how to loop the DVD player, so ""Fight Club"" played 24/7 in our living room. At one point, he kissed his hand, poured lye on it, and gave himself a real chemical burn—just like in the movie.

While living with Pete, I was also developing a serious relationship with a young woman who was studying at UC Santa Cruz. The long distance made things difficult at times, and when the relationship hit hurdles, I didn’t always handle the grief and rejection well. But Pete was always there for me. He validated my pain, empathized with me, and pushed me to turn my suffering into motivation for creativity.

The best advice he ever gave me came during one of my lowest moments. After listening to me complain and cry for as long as I needed, Pete finally looked at me and said, ""Embrace the suck."" At the time, I didn’t fully understand it. He explained what he meant, but I took it as a way to bandage up the pain and move on.

It wasn’t until my mental health worsened—after several suicide attempts, years of hospitalizations, therapy, and constant recovery—that I began to truly grasp the meaning of Pete's words. I realized I had been bottling up emotions I wasn’t even aware of. Simply dealing with the pain only made it come back tenfold, eventually leading me to the brink of taking my own life.

Then, during the COVID-19 pandemic, my world fell apart again. The Social Security Administration terminated my benefits, leaving me homeless. I ended up living in my car on the streets of Seattle, a city that had become lawless during the pandemic. Every day was a struggle just to stay alive, and I was constantly on edge, fearing for my safety.

During this time, Pete’s first daughter, whom I had met when she was eight years old and had reconnected with over Facebook, reached out to me. I’ll never forget the message she sent. I was dealing with the daily challenges of living in my car, battling despair and uncertainty, when she told me, ""Daddy died."" Pete, my friend since I was 18, the person who had been a guiding light in my life, had passed away from a heart attack at the age of 52. I hadn’t seen him since I was 30, and now he was gone.

I never got the chance to tell Pete how much his words, ""Embrace the suck,"" had become a life support for me, especially during those dark times. I miss him deeply. His voice still comes to me in my darkest moments—when I’m heartbroken, depressed, disappointed, feeling worthless, or hurt by someone. I completely ""embrace the suck."" I live it, letting it fully affect my emotional state. I allow myself to feel the pain completely until it’s gone. I even set deadlines to cut the crap if it lingers too long, but I always give the pain a place to exist.

I use this approach when someone hurts me or when I’m full of self-hate for messing up. I let myself feel just how awful the situation is and connect with the source of that pain. This way, I understand how deeply it affects me, and it becomes a motivation to avoid that pain in the future. If someone repeatedly hurts me, I eventually reach a point where I never want to experience that pain again, leading me to set boundaries and remove that person from my life. If it’s something I’ve done to myself, the memory of the suffering helps me decide not to make the same mistake again."
Everything I read about burnout seems to be geared toward people with families who are trying to do it all. Where’s the burnout book for single disabled people who are exhausted from just trying to exist in the world?,303,disability,"i’m not single but i am working full time and doing grad school with all my disabilities. it’s super fucking hard sometimes. i’m on a decent med regimen now so my mental health is great! which makes me more able to do things. but my physical health is terrible right now
Yeh I feel like that is the real problem no one can fix. 

Best I can do is doing constant work to remind myself not to be driven to burn out because of the guilt and shame our capitalist, class obsessed society relentlessly shoves down our mouths. 

Just that constant mental battle alone takes up even more time and energy that I don't have and losing the battle most days is a terrible weight on my mental health. 

I'm really trying to change my reaction to these bs social norms but it's not easy when it's ubiquitous in every facet of life and relationships with other people, so it's always a neverending and severely draining battle on top of all of the shame, guilt, disappointed, lonelyness,  depression and more endless misery it entails."
Why are people needlessly cruel to those of us with invisible disabilities? ,258,disability,"You need to block these people. Right now the world is experiencing a rise in extreme rightwing ideologies, particularly the F one. These ideologies emphasize physical strength and condemn weakness. It is a form of brainwashing. One US presidential candidate told his nephew to let his disabled son die; as former president, he packed his administration with eugenicists. 

Lots of people have internalized these beliefs bc of the constant onslaught on social media by bots and disinformation; other people attend prosperity gospel churches where the same message is hammered in. Their god prefers the Uberman; mental health issues are caused by demons. The cult of Ayn Rand glorifies selfishness and greed, and Calvinist theology reinforces it.

Feminists say “the personal is political.” The converse is true as well—the political becomes personal. People absorb this propaganda and start to believe it themselves. Even people who consider themselves “liberal” will treat disabled people like shit. I am estranged from two of my siblings for this reason. Outwardly they are all about supporting liberal causes, such as helping refugees, but they will call me “lazy” and “crazy.” 

It can be helpful emotionally to get involved in disability advocacy and counteract these negative ideologies. Online, it’s all about language use and framing. You can learn to spot negative language and replace it with positive by focusing on positive values. George Lakoff is a linguist and cognitive scientist who explains how the human brain uses metaphors to frame the world. In his book [Don’t Think of an Elephant](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/dont-think-of-an-elephant-know-your-values-and-frame-the-debate-the-essential-guide-for-progressives_george-lakoff/263729/item/27240142/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=high_vol_frontlist_standard_shopping_retention&utm_adgroup=&utm_term=&utm_content=698403107263&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADwY45jsPFVpxuJXUsfn92woJIeYH&gclid=Cj0KCQjwh7K1BhCZARIsAKOrVqF_qxm3JKj9QntgsSZR178cHEKuYhUOfKSZvid0A9aLo1E0Bni1JP4aAoY9EALw_wcB#idiq=27240142&edition=8081469) he explains how the Right creates and spreads the harmful disinformation you experience on social media. He also teaches how to combat it, by reframing. Focus on the values of empathy and compassion. Actively correct people by using different words. 

But you also need to block the negativity and seek out positivity.
Ever since a toddler I have picked my fingers and still do, so for 40 years I have picked them till they bleed and afterwards i get embarrassed and shamed. This is from a trauma as a baby that caused a permanent bruise mass on my upper lip from being held incorrectly and bashing my lip on my dad tooth, after this my mum said I started picking my fingers, being shy nervous and not wanting to go to school because felt sick. She said she took me to doctors and the doctor prescribed medication for heartburn and indigestion to settle tummy, and put plasters on fingers!! She just thought I was shy and nervous and not mentally traumatised by the accident so don’t know in 1983/5 how help with these symptoms in the UK were diagnosed. It took 20 years to get an anxiety diagnosis and another 10 to say it’s agoraphobia and a disability. As you do research of other symptoms of anxiety because not sure if it’s normal behaviour or due to anxiety I’m so confused with results. I’m a shamed of my past because of the things I did as a teenager like unprotected intercourse with different men, dangerous driving, moody, frustrated, always arguing with parents self destructive actions, failed relationships, could stay in job, struggled with every day life every single thing is so difficult for me, at school couldn’t concentrate so had low grades, always takes me longer to learn things . My parents were very protective of me because of bullying from my lip appearance so I had always had all my battles and problems for me so I never developed that action and still struggle with this to day as someone else has always done that for me which is my husband now. until I was 18 that’s when these started to happen I thought it might be retaliation of being controlled but it is because I had not been allowed to learn by own experiences so after research of why I have these behaviours because I was shamed of my actions afterwards and would pick my fingers for hours and have dark thoughts to get relief from all the pain and fear and worries and frustration I was sort of relieved it is to do with the trauma I suffered as a child, I never told anyone this before not even a councillor because of worrying about what people would think which I have since the traumatic experience. But now that mental health is becoming more known I have been told it’s 4 years wait for a full Psychiatric Evaluation, or pay private of £600. I have had 5 CBT sessions and not helped just made me more frustrated as was just told do these things but I try and get frustrated 😣. I lost friends because I never know how to be one I struggle with peoples emotions and can’t express emotions as from having to attend my grand parents funerals I felt nothing I actually smiled and had to force to cry to show people I did care I was embarrassed of my actions I think the medication has stopped this more than use to. People thought I was nasty, rude self centred selfish person and would be avoid and not included or invited always choosen last in PE like the movies, my parents said it’s who I was like!!! They still don’t understand and never helped me so not seen them 5 years, can anyone help with explaining why I am like this? And any help with dealing with own experiences would be very appreciated. Thank you for listening 🥰
Can relate to this so much. I have mental health issues after trauma and since being out of crisis state from my ptsd, my family think I’m ’ok now’.

I’m not. I mask. Every single day. I deal with it all the time just underneath the surface. 

I also have some disabling medical conditions. I don’t even tell them when it’s affecting me as I’d never shit up.
I always get shunned for smiling or having fun or being relaxed when say about my mental health, my parents or friends didn’t understand my pain or disability, smiling was my disguise 🥸 so they thought I was ok so didn’t worry about me. As soon as you start showing some symptoms it’s like your lying 🤥 or they over mother cuddle you like I am about to die. They don’t know what to do so I just mask it to avoid that with close friends and family, so can understand completely about being asked if need help all the time and how suffocating it can be as you sometimes feel like voiding places but why should we, but I also get the opposite when out and about because If I have an anxiety attack because of the place and situation it’s like I’m contagious because people don’t understand what’s happening and that it’s a disability. People either leave or stare or whisper so makes me even more anxious so just Avoid going out altogether because this causes anxiety just thinking about having to go out and most of the time it causes so much distress I can’t go out and end up cancelling appointments because of other people’s actions. It seems If you’re in a wheelchair your incapable of doing anything and if you aren’t in a wheelchair it’s your very capable as can’t see your inner pain and struggling with it. Because of some peoples lack of understanding and actions and thought processes around disability we have these problems so Until they stuffer them selves they will never know. I really appreciate all the help for us but it’s the people who don’t understand need to be educated more.
PIP because I can’t travel alone in public transport or using sat nav in a car without help I have to have someone with me or just a simple journey to shop without support because of my anxiety I can’t leaving the home alone as having a panic attack and being around people alone causes my anxiety to cause me disoriented this is caused from my work causing this from accusing me from being on holiday when off for mental health.
Aww 🥰 it’s very worrying with what is going on, yeah I try not to read the news. I’m glad you have an out let that works for you. My fear is other peoples opinions and thoughts of how I come across because of my mother always criticising my appearance, my weight or hair style or clothing so I cut ties with my family. My husband is my safety net he understands. My agoraphobia came from work when they accusing me for using my mental health as to get time off to go on holiday, it made it worse as now I can’t go out as I think people are judging me for going out and having fun when I have mental health like we are supposed to be miserable looking all the time and also in case I bump into my family I’m constantly looking over my shoulder even though moved far away.
Oh bless you hun. It’s so hard when our self esteem has been chipped away so much that there is so little left to support ourselves. Thank god for your wonderful husband, just having one person in your corner can sometimes be a huge difference. 

Around the time of my health diagnosis and the trauma I was also being emotionally abused by my narcissistic SIL. I cannot describe how much she destroyed me. Bit by bit. Death by a million papercuts. She did it so covertly that my partner didn’t even believe me until he saw it. Obviously he was so upset he didn’t see it in time and it had been going on for years. We are now also no contact with his family, but that’s a very long story.

My mind has blanked out some parts of this time period but I just remember coming home from work (I worked with my SIL) and just crumbling in the corner of the kitchen and just wanting to not exist anymore. I couldn’t understand why someone wanted to hurt me and hate me so much when I’d done everything I could to include her in our lives and the kids lives.

I also remember falling through my mums front door crying the day of the thing that happened but again bits are lost. 

Six years late, I’m still trying to put myself together. 

If it wasn’t for my partner and our kids, I wouldn’t be here. 

He has made me fall in love with him even more,  a hundred fold more than I ever thought possible for being the most amazing human being and helping me recover. Funding thousands of pounds worth of therapy and never once judging me. I thank the stars every day for this man. 

I don’t think we will ever be the same again hun. But we can rebuild as better versions of ourselves. 

The only good thing to come from it all was, for me, it humbled me. 

I’ve always tried to be a kind person, it’s probably my biggest value I hold but I did used to be judgy of people in my head. I remember thinking about someone I knew who said they had anxiety and thinking ‘what the hell have you got to be anxious about’. 

I’m so ashamed to admit that I thought that. I had no idea what hidden battle they were fighting. No idea the depth of damage mental health could cause. 

I’ve made it my mission to educate myself on mental health. To learn tools to help and share my knowledge. 

My daughter has recently been diagnosed with severe OCD and I think maybe what happened to me happened to prepare me to help and understand my daughter’s battle and to help me grow as a person.
It’s just so bad you have to feel like that, that you need to prove yourself of having a disability people cant see, wheelchair users don’t choose to be in a wheelchair because they want to be, they choose to be in a wheelchair because they NEED to be for support or safety when getting around. But If you aren’t permanently in a wheelchair your also get classed as not being disabled or lying because you can either walk or get up, being made to feel you are more understood in a wheelchair than not being in one just proves the ignorance and stupidity of people who are self centred of disabilities of any sort. People who do fake disabilities because they feel they need it for sympathy or likes or ego boost are the ones to cause the problems of people not understanding mental health and disability and when they are real. Why do people think that having a disability when they don’t gives them the idea you have the advantages or a passage to a easy life and being centre of attention when you are disabled for real it’s like their jealous of us so pretend to be so can get the attention!!!! If they just knew the real pain and heart ache that comes with it, but the so called advantages and attention they think it is isn’t too us they just use our disability for own agains, back when the asylums where opened it was different my granddad was in one for his schizophrenia when he was 21 after being in the army guarding Scotland castle, he started to show signs so was put into one and the stories aren’t nice. I knew my granddad as a kind happy person.  Us kids my siblings was shielded from his past by my mum so wasn’t till we were much older did we find out, although mum was not the one to tell us she was embarrassed of his mental illness it was my grandma who told us as she noticed my anxiety and could understand me and explained grandad, I asked about my grandad to my mum for my own curiosity of having a mental illness and she just shut me out and pretended I wasn’t mentally ill either she denied it to her self making me feel unloved, I haven’t seen my family for 5 years because of my mental health for my own health I had leave so my husband and his family are my family and fully accept me. I use to wish every day to be different to be normal understood but that doesn’t exist. So many of us are struggling with our demons and pain but we survive ✊"
It is not appropriate to tell people whether or not they can use a mobility aid.,254,disability,"From what I’ve seen most of these “can I use a mobility aid?” Questions are people who are experiencing enough pain/difficulty weight the aid that they aren’t able to engage in activities they want. That is exactly what mobility aids are for, to enable people to do the activities they wouldn’t be able to do otherwise (or would feel significant pain/discomfort). 

There is a difference between being “disabled” and having a “disability” though which some people don’t seem to realise. “Disabled” as a legal definition refers specifically to people who struggle to carry out daily living or mobility activities without equipment.

A “disability” can be anything that makes a specific task harder, and does not need to actually limit your ability to live. 
For example dyslexia is a disability, if you’re in work or education you might need extra support or equipment, but the vast majority of people with dyslexia will not classify as disabled.
Someone who’s elderly might be perfectly able day to day but would struggle with a big trip so might use a wheelchair or scooter temporarily. They aren’t disabled, but the use of mobility equipment can still enable them in certain contexts.

Obviously anyone who’s using equipment unnecessarily because they want attention or to be part of a protected group is completely in the wrong. 
However, it’s an extremely small minority of people who might do this. Evidence suggests that people under report disability and equipment is used less than it should be. Stigma against people using equipment is huge, and equipment is cumbersome, it’s not some fun ride and anyone who doesn’t need it and doesn’t have significant mental health issues is unlikely to keep using it long.

So for the most part telling people “if you think it’d help you live your life then you’re the judge” is not likely to be problematic. Gatekeeping equipment is far more likely to cause issues. Most people don’t act they luxury of waiting for mobility equipment to be prescribed either. It took me 2 years to get a wheelchair prescribed, and I’ll still have to self fund most of it. Those 2 years after years of being housebound I’ve been able to live a full life and get back to work because I went ahead and got myself a small mobility scooter."
I live in a group home and they are mentally and emotionally abusive.,252,disability,"I assume your case worker is through community mental health? They should have someone filling in while she is off. Also, report rights violations to their recipients right attorney. Group homes can be a great option, but this one sounds terrible.
I live in a SNF, I've been here since the beginning of September. The food is around 70% awful. Most of it seems to be canned or frozen, over salted, under seasoned, or just tastes gross. The soup is usually the Campbell's condensed kind and a few times it was barely thinned out. I think the eggs are powdered and they are almost always wet. I don't know how else to describe them, but it's just gross. I keep having to order from Grubhub because I cannot stomach what they give me. The nurses and CNA's are nice to me, but I feel like one of the ladies in social services doesn't like me because I can speak up for myself and what's going on.  She ignored me for weeks when I wanted to change rooms. The other patients though, a lot of them do not belong in a nursing facility, but either in a memory care facility or a mental health facility. Some are verbally abusive to the staff. They yell, scream, and curse at them. They will shout out their demands over and over instead of hitting their call light and waiting their turn. The staff here are not trained to deal withse types of patients. Then there are the physically abusive ones who hit the staff and throw things. And the staff are basically told to put up with it. It's disgusting. And they are way understaffed. 10+ patients for 1 CNA sometimes. I've thought about contacting someone, but it needs to be through email as I don't want anyone to hear what I have to say.
You need to reach out to your social worker and DEMAND to be moved! I am currently living in medical foster care as a charge of the state (I have a significant TBI that left me with a significant cognitive impairment and anger control issues, I’m also a paraplegic, I have refractory [uncontrolled despite being on 3 meds at once] epilepsy which is how I became paralyzed and got my TBI in the first place, I have severe agoraphobia and anxiety disorders along with OCD and depression, I’ve also got autism and severe ADHD.), and when I finally decided to relieve my family of the burden of caring for me by leaving the family home and going into the custody of the state, I made it VERY clear that I was NOT going to go into a group home setting or a “facility” of any kind. I told her that I would only accept a medical foster care situation (Because the point of the foster care setting is that it is a HOME based setting. You literally move into a regular family home, where a family or an individual who has gone through all of the necessary medical and foster care training and continuing education is supposed to treat you like part of the family, albeit one with whatever special needs that the social workers have asked them to manage, assist with, or simply observe.), and that I even had already picked out the foster home and foster guardian I wanted to move in with. I was lucky enough timing wise, that one of my close friends who runs a medical/cognitive health foster home had just kicked out his last client a few months before, so he held off on accepting any new clients until my social worker could place me in his foster home all by myself. No other clients with me here! It has been working pretty well so far, though inevitably when a friendship adds in a caretaking and business aspect to it, there are ALWAYS going to be some growing pains. Lol. Obviously you probably don’t just randomly have a friend who happens to provide the exact type of care that you need at the exact moment that you need in, which I really wish you did so that you could get out of there right away! BUT, I tell you all of this to tell you that it sounds like medical adult foster care sounds like it is exactly where you should have been placed instead of the hellscape you are currently in. So PLEASE call your social worker immediately to report the abuses you have been subjected to and DEMAND to be moved IMMEDIATELY, and that you will only accept a foster care/family setting. Because of the fact that you are being abused, you should be able to forgo the 30/60 day notice of breaking your tenancy at the group home (or however many days your state mandates/whatever your lease or contract with the group home mandates). Go online to look up the number for reporting vulnerable adult abuse by a DHS provider, and call ASAP to get the ball rolling on a proper report of the abuses and mistreatment you are suffering from. ESPECIALLY the suddenly watching you bathing thing, which sounds really sexual assault/harassment-y to me! If it was not on your cares sheet that you saw and signed at the beginning of your stay in the home that you needed to be supervised for your safety in the bathroom/tub, there is ZERO excuse why a staff member should be watching you bathe! Make sure you voice your discomfort with this situation ESPECIALLY with both the DHS reporting line AND your social worker! (I have to be supervised in the shower due to my epilepsy having nearly killed me in the shower more than once, but even that doesn’t mean someone STARES at me while I shower!!! WTF?! My friend just sits on my wheelchair reading articles about gaming and stuff like that while I shower with the shower curtain fully closed. He’s there close enough to hear if I start having a seizure and act quickly enough to hopefully prevent me from hurting myself, or if I need help with something I can call out to him and ask him to grab a thing and give it to me, or something like that. I NEVER would’ve signed my care contract if it had said that I needed to be WATCHED with eyeballs the whole time I bathed! No way!) You may have some mental health struggles, but you sound MORE than competent to make decisions as to how you wish to have your cares completed and as to where you’d desire to be placed while you get better. (Because, let’s face it, NO ONE gets better while being abused and underfed! Honestly, your lunchtime looks worse than the slop we got in the school cafeteria!!! Yuck!) There is absolutely ZERO reason, based on how you’ve presented yourself and your living situation here, as to why you should be left to continue suffering in that madness! I wish you all the best, and I really hope that you are able to get out of there quickly! Hopefully I was able to help, at least a little…. If you have any questions about how to present your arguments to your social worker, or if your social worker doesn’t listen to you, feel free to reach out to me, and I’ll do what I can to help! I can also ask my friend who is my foster guardian what steps you could take and who else to contact if you’d like me to! Good luck, friend!"
Mental Healthcare in the US [tw: suicidal ideation],232,disability,"Fun fact, the Conservative paradise Switzerland(not as conservative as Americans think) REQUIRES ALL INSURANCE, to cover mental health treatment.

Not trying to be political. Just saying the people who say we “need better mental health care” don’t care and that’s depresssing

America has so many problems with mental health care that it actually worsens my depression.
I see you have BPD too OP, dealing with the lowest common denominator of mental health professionals while borderline is FUCKING HORRIFIC. I was fortunate to be able to access DBT while I still could, but these days I feel like a robot that hasn't been tuned up in forever. Now all that ever happens is I get treated like a drug-seeker or outright abused if I seek help. My most recent inpatient stays I was there both times because I wanted to die because my mom passed away in 2015 and then my house burned down a couple of months later, and both times I had the same psychiatrist assigned to me, who completely ignored that I show serious signs of PTSD from being a caregiver to a cancer patient and surviving a fire, tried to diagnose me with autism and accused me of being addicted to whatever meds I happened to be using for anxiety at the time. Now I'm permanently banned from benzos when I have absolutely debilitating anxiety (and despite that I only took my klonopin like twice a week tops, I feel MUCH better just knowing I have the option), and all that does now is force me to self-medicate, which just leads me to being accused of drug seeking again! 
There is a debate on whether suicide is selfish. I do think suicide is selfish, but I don't think being selfish is a bad thing. We're all selfish to an extent. When a person is committing suicide they are in a place of hell and want to escape. The people who don't want them to commit suicide are usually concerned about their own feelings around death rather than the persons suffering. Yes there is mental health treatment, but it's hard to access. There aren't many good psychiatrists available, especially those that take insurance. Even then you get comments like ""What do you have to be depressed about. You're in a 1st world country."" ""Everyone is a little bit OCD"" ""Medication should be a last resort."" ""She's bipolar. One minute she's happy the next minute she's angry."" ""You look fine to me."" ""Every teen does that."" Heck people are called drug seeking for seeking non\-controlled medication to help them. Until we start taking mental health seriously, we have no right to complain about suicide.
I think this might be overstating it a bit, but I also happen to live in one of the most liberal regions of the country, so maybe I'm just spoiled. We definitely suck compared to other developed nations on healthcare coverage, especially mental healthcare. It's still so stigmatized that people I work with who come to me at the independent living center are often very reluctant to share their disability when it's part of what we ask after (they're entitled to not disclose and I respect that right fully, just wish people hadn't become so conditioned to treat behavioral health as this weird taboo.)
God that is so fucking awful! Yeah, they really don't know shit about mental health. I was diagnosed with CPTSD when I was put on an involuntary hold, and they didn't try to help me at all?  Like I got 3 sessions of therapy, and they were like, ""That's probably enough to combat the years of abuse!"" I want to be hospitalized, but it is so hit or miss, and the chances of me actually getting help are soooooo low.
Trying to get help for prolonged abuse is honestly really difficult, and not just in America. My partner's from the UK and while the NHS exists, some areas are just total shit for mental health. Almost every time he started a new therapy and told me what they were doing, they were doing it completely wrong. Not just differently from what I know, straight up wrong. They would end EMDR sessions without going through the safe space thing. They didn't even set up a mental safe space for him if I remember correctly, which is crucial if a session ends in the middle of processing a high stress situation.  
The first time I did a few asshole moves to get assigned to a different doctor, and the same asshole moves put me on suicide watch. She just wasn't listening to me and I have issues with that because I was medically abused by a psychiatrist as a teen."
"""So, do you have a job yet?"" Yes, it's called my disability.",234,disability,"I have a pretty bad relationship with my mother, but she sometimes says useful things like this exact thing you said.

I always feel guilty about being disabled and getting SSI benefits thanks to people who pay taxes in my country.

It's like I want to prove that the economical effort people do for my sake is not going to waste.

This leads to getting burnt out because of trying arduously to get a job or study and just not being able to.

&#x200B;

That day, I told her my feelings and she said:

""Your job is surviving. That SSI benefits you're getting are your monthly pay for your survival task.""

(It's a mental health issue, but I think physical disabled folks feel like this too)

&#x200B;

My mother and I are in a pretty abusive love-hate relationship and I want to emancipate so we can't hurt each other anymore, but the SSI benefits are not enough for that and the more time I spend in this house, the worse my condition gets.

And that affects my studies and job seeking, which are the factors that could let me emancipate. It's an ouroboros situation.

&#x200B;

I think the SSI benefits should fill the economical needs we disabled people need without having to relay on relatives: rent, energy, food, medical bills, special education, and maybe some basic leisure like sports, outings, books, etc.

I mean... it's not a whim, right? We didn't choose to be disabled. I think we have the right to get help to live peacefully. We already have it very difficult because of our disabilities, isn't it?

Of course, if we improve and become able to study and work, we will immediately want to try and do our best! Because nobody feels good being neet and getting excluded from everything in life...

&#x200B;

I'm sorry about what I'm going to say, but sometimes...

...It feels like it's not worth to live like this, always being escrutinized by rude people, like poor OP has felt today, even with all the titanic efforts they do everyday.

Or always depending on a relative and not having anywhere to go or anything to do, in my case, while every non-disabled friend or classmate is doing much better.

You are awesome, OP and everyone here.
I feel you. My physical limitations are pretty mild, but my mental health disabilities make things very challenging. 



Most days are a struggle to get out of bed. My dog helps a lot with this, and he physically forces me out of the bed if it's a really bad day. Each day I track my ADLs to review with my counselor each week. If I comb my hair and brush my teeth every day, it's a really good week. 



In addition to the daily grind, each week I have a ketamine treatment. I have to find transportation to and from because I can't drive for the rest of the day. I spend 2 hours at the doctor's office under medical supervision after they give me the meds. I also have counseling every week. 




Once a month I go to the hospital for an ECT treatment. It takes an hour to get there in good weather. Usually I'm at the hospital for about 4 hours. The treatment itself is short, but it takes a while to get checked in, hooked up for anesthesia, and recover afterwards."
Who else has a different disability?,227,disability,"I was diagnosed with neurosyphilis after some mental health issues. It was treated with a few weeks of IV antibiotics but I have a lot of residual brain damage like balance problems, problems with loud noises, mania/depression, and paranoia.
I have fibromyalgia and Dyxpraxia on top of mental health issues.
My disabilities are mental health, psychiatric and developmental (autism) + a physical disability that’s mostly improved but how it is now is likely permanent damage

Some of my symptoms aren’t diagnosed yet but are disabling. But I consider those separate from the list above due to the lack of diagnosis

My most notable are: 

Officially diagnosed: Persistent depressive disorder, 2 Anxiety Disorders, CPTSD, migraines 

Symptoms with no diagnosis: Hallucinations (smell, touch, verbal, noise and visual), panic attacks, mild confusion, mind fog, memory issues

It used to be so much worse and it could easily get that bad again :(
I also have CVID, fibromyalgia, seizures, and a multitude of mental health issues. I've passed my bad genes onto my kids which I can't help but feel guilty about. My Dr is currently testing me for lupus which I really hope I don't have. I really don't need another diagnosis right now lol.
absolutely. and the ways and reasons for why our disabilities are so difficult aren’t the same either! for someone like me, my disability is a challenge because of itself. supports and mental health advances can be helpful, but there’s a certain degree of “shitty” that’s always gonna be there, so I’d personally much rather not have this disability. disabilities that are associated with things like chronic pain are likely often a similar case; the difficulty is self-sustaining.

on the other hand, disabilities like being Deaf or having autism are more complicated in their challenges. I’ve met many folks with these disabilities who say that the most difficult part is access - living in a world that is unprepared and unwilling to meet their needs, even though it’s possible to do so. so, they view the core difficulties as being more external. a sort of, “my disability is only labelled that because the world doesn’t want to accept anything that isn’t cookie-cutter,” and I totally understand that mentality!

obviously not everyone with those specific disabilities feels that way, but it’s a sentiment that’s there. these are also really big differences in the lived experience that different folks with disabilities have."
"Being ABLE to work hard is a privilege which the average (able-bodied) person isn't aware of    
",225,disability,"Tru to the truest. 

I came out of teenage hood disabled with no diagnosis due to my family just deciding obviously I was 'lazy'. It didn't matter that I was unable to get up for 20hrs a day from 13 onwards.

I'm still fighting for help from the system and it in itself is exhausting. My job is exhausting. Consistently explaining to my workplace that 'no I cannot take on more work' is just too much.
 I'm under paid in my field which is probably the only reason they haven't fired me over this. 

The worst part is that I love working and really rather work than sit in bed in pain on a bad day. Time, and the pain, just pass faster when you have something to do.
honestly i was just about to make a post about a similar sentiment. a lot of my family friends/family are disabled but can work and they are so sure that i should be able to push through what im going through to make it work. that pain is better than being reliant on other people. the reality is i can barely walk, i have several other physical health issues at any given time, and my mental health is so fragile that i just cant handle pressure. there isnt a job that exists for someone like me and of there did id love to have it just so people would stop looking down on me so much.

not to mention, most of those folks are barely holding it together and throw their health into chaos by constantly pushing themselves. some people have to but a lot of the people i know are too proud even just to lighten their workload.

ive worked so hard to get government support so im not living with my mom and when i told someone they still asked me when i was getting a job, like im just freeloading and avoiding it. im just so tired of being looked down on by people who are supposed to see me as a human."
Discourse? ADHD as disability ,222,disability,"You're wrong about one assumption, and that's the assumption that ADHD is a mental health disorder. It's not. It's a developmental disability that's also neurological. And physically disabling someone isn't the only way to disable someone. 

Combined type ADHD is typically the type that makes someone unable to work and require disability, but the other two types can do this as well. ADHD impacts basic functioning and can prevent you from doing tasks. ADHD causes ""time blindness,"" which is when someone can't feel the passage of time. Two hours could pass, but the person with time blindness would think that only 15 minutes had passed, so ADHD literally takes away our sense of time. There's also ADHD Paralysis, where the body is paralyzed and can't move because the brain is too overwhelmed with stress, the environment (a messy room, for example), or exhaustion. 

ADHD takes over the entire brain and body. It makes life harder and puts those of us with it at a disadvantage. That's honestly just a few reasons why it's a disability. 

I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Congenital Heart Disease, Autism, and other physical and mental disabilities but my ADHD is still one that I struggle with the most even though it was my first diagnosis. 

I hope that helped.
Diagnosed with ADHD last year, DID last year, and bipolar 2 the year before. My ADHD was the last thing to be diagnosed to treated and being on medication has changed it from disabling my life to being manageable. There are a lot of factors. It was making treatment or commitment to any of my other mental health issues impossible. 

Some people may have “mild” ADHD and not consider it disabling. When I can’t get up to go to the bathroom, get to a therapy appointment, or take my meds because of executive dysfunction it impacts my entire body/life. My focus used to be all over the place and I’d fall asleep constantly. 

So I think compounded with any other mental health issues or physical health issues then yeah it makes a persons disabled.
Technically, I guess that's right. Sometimes it's used often incorrectly as an umbrella term for learning disabilities though a lot of times it seems to fit. I have a strong diagnosed case of it myself, but I never considered it a disability in of itself. There are several ways to work with it (at least in my case), but I can see where some people will struggle no matter the method used. If nothing else, I have empathy with genuine cases, but it makes me cringe when people casually blame their imaginary ADHD for a rare small mistake or minor lapse in attention. Like, ""Oops, I forgot my laptop for the first time in 6 years, must be the ol' ADHD kicking in, hyuck, hyuck!"" Now I know this can differ immensely, but my experience goes something like this:

-Wake up, take my Adderall, clean myself.
-Spend too much time in the shower thinking about all the things I need to do before coming to my senses and moving on to getting dressed.
-Spend a full 5 minutes staring at my bottle of stimulants, which I've set upside down as an indicator that I did take them, to try to recall if I took them or forgot to flip the bottle right side up the night before.
-Repeat the phrase ""wallet, phone, keys, and vape"" while patting down my jacket.
-Turn my attention to the pot of coffee I forgot I made, fill my Thermos.
-Jacket on, walk to the door; freeze.
-Turn around, grab my lunch from the fridge, back to the door; freeze.
-Repeat the phrase ""wallet, phone, keys, and vape"" while patting down my jacket.
-Turn around, track down my keys... and my debit card that I just remembered I took out of my wallet last night to impulse buy something that caught my interest.
-Finally, out the door unless I see my reflection in the window as if to remind me my hair is way too messy for the office. Grab a hat, then fix it during break later.
-Walk to work, enjoy the fresh air of freedom for 10 minutes.
-Reach the door to my workplace, have a small moment of dread while frantically feeling for my security tag. Feel relief if found or like you your whole day is ruined if not.
-Reach my cubical, no one but me there and the lights are off; silent, peaceful, and the best part of my shift.
-Begin my work routine (which I've written with a timed itinerary and pinned to my wall).
-Realize how far behind I am when coworkers file in. Notice our daily webcam Teams meeting is in 5 minutes.
-Work during the meeting to catch up, retain about half the information. Meeting ran long, factory floor walkthrough with dept. heads starts in 2 minutes and I have to use the restroom. Go as quickly as possible without seeming frantic. Say an awkward ""good morning"" to any coworkers I happen to see on the way.
-I have 1 minute, shove my messy hair into a hairnet and pack it down to look decent. Head downstairs, check to see if my fly is open along the way.
-Walkthrough runs a bit long, but that's fine until my supervisor needs to ask me a few questions. He's about a minute from his next meeting and still chatting with me like a psychopath. My blood pressure goes up on his behalf, but I joy down a few notes of the minor tasks he's given me.
-It's 9AM and the Adderall is finally kicking in. Time to accomplish something of value. I work straight through lunch, I'm not even hungry due to the side effects, keep working. The only limiting factor is how long it takes to respond to my voicemails and emails.
-Recall that I had some minor tasks to complete, have to run downstairs to grab the note that lists them that I left behind. I have 1-2 hours to complete. Finish quick, go home at 3PM.
-Run back to work because I forgot my phone or something important that I put in a drawer early in the day (once or twice a week).

That's just my professional life, but obviously some days are better than others and ADHD can vary widely in severity. I wouldn't discount it as a disability, still, people seem to think I'm forgetful, quirky, a fast worker, and (ironically) laser focused all at once.
Disclaimer: *I don't have ADHD, but I do have mental health disorders that contribute to my disability*

In my opinion, I really think the term ""disability"" should be used as liberally as people would like. If they feel they are disabled, then they're disabled. I think gatekeeping the term really isn't helpful for disability rights (1) , and can cause a lot of unintentional harm (2). 

1) Obviously there's a spectrum of disability, and there can be concerns about including those who have ""less severe"" conditions as disabled. My response to that is that that's always been the case, and that that rhetoric is often used to reinforce systems of ableism. (For example, mental health disorders, other invisible disabilities being included as disabilities) Labelling yourself as disabled is such a personal thing based on your own experiences with the world around you, and I think denying someone that is really counterproductive to promoting a less ableist society. 

(Also, I think the world is so ableist and the term ""disabled"" carries so much stigma, that if there really are any """"non disabled"""" people using the term when they shouldn't, they'll be quickly weeded out)

2) I can't begin to tell you the number of people (myself included) who I've met/heard of be terrified of using the term ""disabled"" because they don't feel their condition is ""bad enough"". (Especially people who don't have stereotypical/visible disabilities) For me, the term was liberating and validating and invaluable in getting the help I need. Not using the term meant years in delayed treatment and care that I could have been using sooner. I just wouldn't want to deny anyone else that experience.
How is adhd by itself not a primary mental health disorder it's literally a mental health disorder
Context is important. Untreated ADHD in an educational or workplace setting can be a huge barrier and have a major impact on your life and wellbeing. 

Unfortunately, we have a culture of competitive victimhood online, which inspires people to latch onto any identity based excuse for their behavior or choices and then wield that identity against any critique, valid or not. That seems to be what this initial tweet was reacting to."
Laughable ableism on Reddit,218,disability,"Just for clarification, is there a difference between excluding disabled and mentally ill from your consideration for dating or dating pool just because they are disabled versus knowing your needs and capabilities and that you can't manage certain challenges that come with certain conditions one has (like you won't consider being with someone who has bipolar disorder or schizophrenia because you'll feel unsafe with their instability, and you know you will have a better quality of life and have your needs met, it's what is best for you given your circumstances, and you connect better with someone who has minor mental health conditions or none at all also this is very important to you because most of your life, you didn't have the freedom to do what is best for you)?
I don't want to date someone who doesn't have coping mechanisms for their disability/mental health conditions and I don't think it's fair to do the same to others
After being in a relationship with someone with severe mental illness who physically abused me and my pets, I have a hard line now when it comes to mental illness. But only those with cluster B personality disorders who show they have a propensity for abuse. 

My mental health isn't stellar either so I know no one is perfect. I have clinical depression, ADHD, autism, and now PTSD. I've also come to the conclusion that my conditions probably make me more vulnerable to predators and it's important to learn how to protect myself from them. 
 
After what I've been through, I'm not sure if I'm being ableist. I'd like to think that I'm not, I'm just protecting myself. I guess it's a blurry line into ableism for me. 

I do find ableism abhorrent though and those who display it are to be avoided.
I don't think that's ableist at all. I think it's just a lot of awareness about the limitations your own disability creates- you know what you can and cannot offer. I have physical disabilities due to chronic pain disorders, so I could never be in a Shane & Hannah Burcaw kind of relationship. It's not that I wouldn't WANT to date someone with SMA, but I would be physically unable to provide care to them. I think you're saying something similar- it's not that you wouldn't WANT to date someone with a mental health condition, but you can't offer the support someone with similar symptoms to you would need. That's totally valid.
I also don't think it's fair to get into a relationship while knowing you're struggling with your mental health as it's a lot for the other person. I've been on the receiving end of it twice and it's horrid to be shut out because of that"
how do you stop grieving who you could've been if not for disabilities?,215,disability,"I acquired my physical and mental health conditions in my teens and 20s and it was hard knowing my life would be more limited than most. I'm 31 now can I can't say I don't grieve for who I might have been from time to time.

I think it is very much a grieving process. I found looking at advice on losing a loved one helped. Obvs it's not the same but there's still the same sort of emotions to work through.

I battled a lot in my head in my 20s I had nearly made it. I had gotten a job I loved and although financial things were not great I felt I was finally on the way up. A year later I'd been in hospital so long I'd lost my home and didn't even have enough to buy a drink in my bank account let alone public transport to my home town. Life had really reached rock bottom. But that experience taught me something. Relationships, friendships and the interactions we have with others and the world around us are so valuable.

Although several years on I have a stable living situation I still can't do the job I loved and as I couldn't get home I ended up living in a different area away from much of my support network at the time. Since then I've started to build my life back up. I have friends who really care about me and still see some of my family. That's what matters the most to me.

Life didn't take me the way I expected and while things are likely harder I've still been able to find a few really good people to have around me and I'm getting by. My future looked rubbish when I just looked at the practical stuff like being independent and working but I forgot that there's so much more to being human than working my backside off for someone else. Plus there's people in my life who I can just sit next to. The simple act of being in their presence improves their quality of life just because they like being with me, sounds a bit mad when you think about it like that. They might do practical things for me but that makes them feel good about themselves and they get to have a bit of a giggle at my sense of humour while we are at it - I'm by no means a comedian but do like finding the funny side to stuff.
I'm 30 and have several of the conditions you do, though I wasn't diagnosed until recently. I have ADHD, GAD, HEDS, POTS, probably CPTSD, plus some other stuff with my heart and eyes. 

Like you, I also didn't graduate high school due to mental health, and I went on disability assistance right at 18. I didn't get a job until 23. 

Unfortunately, stress is only going to make everything worse, which I know in the position you are in now feels impossible to stop. My best recommendation is to really focus all you can on your health. Look for every option, insist you need it and don't wait until you feel at your worst before taking action. The sooner you can start treatment for all of these things, the better your outcome will be. 

since i wasn't diagnosed with ADHD or HEDS until i was 27/29, i spent a lot of my early 20s trying anxiety treatment after anxiety treatment, not knowing why it never made me feel much better. The moment I was treated for my ADHD I was able to get my GED and graduate from university in two years. Now that I know I have HEDS, i can better understand my limitations and work around them while also doing what i can to make sure i don't get worse(tho this is still pretty new for me)

There is a story in Greek mythology about Odysseus Needing to sail his crew past some sirens. Knowing their weakness to the creatures, he had himself and his men tie themselves to the boat as they drifted past, rather than just assuming, through force if will, they would resist them. Thanks to their preparation, they survived the encounter. 

This is just like having a disability. We have limitations and can't just walk right into situations that non disabled people can. We can, however, get to the same outcome as everyone else. We just have to do some work beforehand. This requires us to acknowledge our limits so that we can prepare for them. Odysseus was no less of a hero for acknowledging their weakness and finding a way around, and the same goes for us disabled people. 

I'm saying all this because you are young and have a lot of time to plan your strategy around what challenges you may have. It might feel like you're falling behind, but in reality, lots of people have needed to wait and prepare before jumping into their adult life. And even more rush in and end up needing to learn the same lessons later in life. It took me until my late 20s and I'm super happy now! Sure, I still live with the issues I did before, but I now have the tools to manage them.

I hope some if this helps. I know exactly what it feels like to be loosing hope and even how scary it feels to accept that there might be hope. You can 100% live a happy life despite all that seems in your way.

edit: I want to add that I don't mean by this we should be able to do everything or that we all have equal access to all resources or that this stuff is really easy. I mean that, if the end goal is happiness, accepting that we cant do some things can be the preparation we sometimes need to make in order to get there. It's OK to grieve those lost options, but don't let grief cover up other paths you can take. I have grieved who I could have been with better support, but dwelling on that doesn't really help. We live in the now, and who we are now definitely deserves our love and attention ❤️

another edit: please feel free to message me if you have any questions! I'd be happy to offer some kind of advice or point you in some directions for help.
Personally, I don't you ever stop completely grieving for what could have been. 

BUT I think what's helped me the most is one simple prayer.

 God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the strength to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. 

I don't consider myself religious and also learned that this is basically a philosophy called Stoicism. ""Stoicism teaches us to focus on the things we can control—our thoughts, emotions, and actions—while accepting the things we cannot, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us.""

We can't change our physical or mental illness, accept it and let that burden go. We can change how we react to our situation by learning ways to cope: meditation, yoga, hobbies, spending time with friends and family, medication, exercise, eating well, therapy ect. You just have to find what works for you.

 Like you I craft, it's my therapy and can even be a meditation of sorts. Focus on what you CAN do and let go of what you can't do. You're 18, you're perfect just the way you are right now. Who you can be still has endless possibilities. 

Lastly I highly recommend considering cognitive therapy if it's possible, because it's your thoughts that are draining you and causing your mental health to decline. 

If you ever want to talk feel free to message me."

Personally, my adhd is something where the problems I face are largely societal. I don’t want a “cure” for myself because I honestly don’t want to be NT. The best thing would be to build systems which are more inclusive. I’m lucky enough to be in a field and in a workplace which suits me well and can capitalize on that difference. 

But my chronic pain and joint injuries are not disabilities because of society. They’re miserable because I’m in pain and I can’t sleep or function when they’re acting up. Yeah they’re way worse because societal factors have frequently made them worse by forcing me to use my limbs and increase my pain anyway, but I’ve been working to cure them for years. 

I’m the middle I’ve got allergies to fragrances (including vapes) and weed. That makes lots of situations around other people potentially deadly. If we as a society didn’t think creating a cloud of fragrance or smoke around you in public spaces was acceptable since it gets into other peoples bodies in potentially harmful ways, I wouldn’t have this issue. But so many people are allergic to different things that I accept eliminating everything that releases compounds into the air is not a reasonable ask. A few hundred years ago, I’d be able to breathe just fine so it’s technically created by society, and many of the issues I face are because of the way different situations are designed. So I need more thought out into how we design airflow in different spaces, but won’t go so far as to claim that my disability there is only based on how disability is treated.
Yeah, the aspie supremacists are quite cringe. Nothing is wrong with feeling empowered by your disability, the problem comes when you try and take it to the point of claiming that autism is a superpower.

I can totally understand how this reactionary ideology came about as a reaction to the demonization of autism by groups like Autism $peaks, but it is basically fighting fire with fire.

Saying ""autism isn't a disability"", is often said by people who forget entire segments of the autistic community that are definitely disabled by having autism. It's cool you're aspie and all but that doesn't mean there aren't people with higher support needs than you. That's basically what I would say to them.

It's also worth noting that aspie supremacy is also anti-disability pride, because aspie supremacy and declaring them to be not disabled is an attempt to distance themselves from the concept of disability. And that is something I simply refuse to accept. Aspie supremacists can do whatever they want... Over there... While the rest of us maintain disability solidarity and the idea that we need unity to stand together.

Neurodiversity is interesting because in a way it is a separate movement but it is alongside disability rights just with the addition of all mental health not just disabilities. Aspie supremacists try and claim the Neurodiversity movement for themselves occasionally but I oppose this strongly because solidarity is more important than *being right all the time.* If we have disagreements or different perspectives, we discuss them cleanly and productivity, we should never ever fight another comrade who believes in solidarity.

As we move forward and we start becoming more organised... We need to remember, what makes us strong is our differences, our experiences are all different, and we have so many unique perspectives. We would be a swiss army knife of an active movement. I hope one day we will be recognised alongside LGBT pride and other large movements. Because if we don't, we won't see the world we want to create.
* condition: we all have them. Nature of life, biodiversity and neurodiversity.
* impairment: if a condition cannot be treated and it leads to limitations in function.
* disability: when a condition or impairment reaches a barrier in home, society, workplace, and it prevents access to services, opportunity, and equity. The barrier in question is often there because of poor design or thoughtlessness of the functional authorities.

These are my definitions for them.

My autism is an impairment in some regards, but I do not consider it a disability (to me).

I am a disability advocate that helps push my policymakers to work better."
Ableist Garbage,195,disability,"Oh, I know all about the struggle to find good mental healthcare. And, I think we all always feel that way. Keep your head up, you got this!"
Wife denied for Mental health claim stating her Social Media presence showed her being happy.,195,disability,"Prudential was pretty clear that they don't see psych disorders as permanent disabilities when I went thru the process with them. Thank goodness that my psych diagnosis didn't enter my claim. I'm sorry to see that things haven't changed.

In general people don't understand how severe mental illness works. You can get bursts of happiness and still be depressed. Also, most people smile in photos in modern times because it's socially expected. Mental health tends to fluctuate over time. Mental illness can cause cognitive & executive function deficits.
We understand that it's not a permanent disability that the pay for, but there is a clause which they will compensate for mental health.
That's interesting. The absolute best thing I ever did for my mental health was getting off social media. No FB, IG, etc.  I decided my real friends deserved actual phone calls and text messages.  I also eventually got off every psych med too. Which made me feel human again.  But, we all have different needs.
Also, I was off work for 2 years and received payment first from my job for 6 months and then from my insurance. I was also able to travel and do any activity that would be helpful for my mental health. So no, I couldn't be outside because then I'm not really sick bs. Being happy and being on the beach is obviously no sign of mental stability. That sounds very absurd what you claim even when it is the US.
It's not worth it because the LTD calls for mental health is only one year of coverage.
My LTD was denied when I was working in banking. I was told that there’s no way to prove a mental health disability, and that literally, it was all in my head."
My neighbour wants to put me in a nursing home,192,disability,"I think even in the craziest area it would be hard to put me there against my will because to do this they would need to prove my home is a danger (it's not) or I need 24/7 nursing (don't even qualify for a cleaning service to come in once a week which is one of the reasons my mom and I moved in together, which is great because she struggles with chores due to depression, together it's only half the load for each with me taking a little less of the physical load and the full mental load which works okay for us) and me being incapable to make sound decisions for myself. And they can't prove the latter with a person who's fully there, highly intelligent, can hold conversations, informs themselves and understands the information, has a history of making the right decisions and has a team of medical professionals who can testify both the nessecary cognitive abilities and medical compliance. There's simply not a single point to attack my ability to make decisions for myself. Thanks to my father's and brother's claims I'm insane and hallucinating the abuse (they switch between this and I'm an evil master manipulator making it up and convincing around a dozen doctors and psychologists most of which specialise in mental health) I have made sure to be as untouchable as possible including not even enjoying a joint and keeping a law insurance no matter what else I can't afford. So good luck with any attempt. But Karen is just a shit stirrer that tried to hurt me. Guess who just planned making the balcony ""her"" stray cats love (she's insanely jealous about them and wants us to make it impossible for them to get onto our balcony) a little more cat friendly and considers to take the friendship the cats offered besides her allergy? If you guessed my mom and me for the first and just me for the second you hit bullseye and won a cookie."
I reported my therapist today. Is he discriminating against me for being disabled?,172,disability,"> Because of my mental health issues and/or medications, I seriously struggle with focus and memory. My wife helps me remember things and I rely on her to remember almost everything because I forget so much. If I don't write it down, it literally didn't happen.

I completely identify with that!  I've started asking my doctors if they're ok with me recording our appointments.  Not every provider is ok with it, which is why I always ask.  I've been recording my therapy sessions for years.  It's great because I don't have that anxiety around making sure I'm taking good notes or remembering every little thing that's said.  I think I've gone back and listened to... maybe 10% of the sessions?  But for those sessions, it's *very* helpful to have the recordings.

It's even better for medical appointments because I can focus on what the doctors are saying rather than worrying about trying to remember it all for later.  Again, I never do it without asking the doctor first and making sure everyone is ok with me recording them.  I explain that I have cognitive issues and auditory processing disorder - my therapist suggested I explain is an accommodation for my disability.  Most doctors are fine with it. Some are not.  I even had one doctor refuse to let me record the appointment, but then at the very end of the appointment he recorded a summary of his diagnosis and recommendations, which was better than nothing.
First, I am so very, very sorry you were treated so horribly.  Therapy is supposed to be a safe place that supports, not causing more issues.  Second, your story is almost identical to mine.  I am a veteran and thought it was just the VA, but obviously, that’s not the case.  I have ptsd from a few sources, but the main one is literally from the way I am treated by medical staff.  I once had a dr fold her arms in front of her chest while listening to me beg for help with the pain, and she and her nurse LAUGHED at me.  My new psych told me that the reason I’m not getting mental health help is because of my attitude and the way I treat people.  I have been begging for therapy since I lost my therapist in October.  I was supposedly starting with a new therapist today, only to find out it’s just an intake, to see if/what I might qualify for.  I’ve had one of these at least 5 times in the past 6 months.  I could go on and on.  I understand😢. That said, never see this person again.  You are supposed to be comfortable with your therapist, that will never happen with this person.  Report them, contact the advocate, and keep looking for real help.  You did not do anything wrong, and you did not deserve this treatment.  I’m so very, very sorry you were traumatized by the very person who is supposed to be helping.
Good to know. My son is on SSDI and we are asked to list all providers he’s seen. 
I just thought it best to move on to another provider rather than have something negative he might write in the medical record. 
Mental health services in this country are very lacking and advocating for yourself can be very difficult. I wish him well.
It was just my take. You asked people if you should have reported him? I didn’t think you should. You will most  likely receive a letter dismissing you as a patient. 
I realize you no plan to see him again but it’s in your medical record now. Wish you the best. I understand how difficult it is to get good mental health care."
Is it ok to mourn a future you never could have had?,159,disability,"""Hey I'm going to throw you a birthday party with your favourite cake and get you that video game you wanted as a present"". You get excited. You look forward to that future. You might even try to find some nice clothes or something. 

""Oh happy birthday. Yeah I decided not to throw you a party or anything like I said I would"". You're sad. You miss the future you were looking forward to. You are mourning your lost party. 

""By the way could you come serve cake at my kid's birthday party?"" Salt in the wound. A big reminder of the party you were expecting and didn't get. 

That's a completely possible scenario. It would be totally normal and natural to feel those types of feelings. Maybe you'd also be angry that the person got your hopes up then didn't do it. Or like an idiot for believing them in the first place. Or some other negative emotions about it. 



You're in the same type of situation. You expected something to happen in your future. You expected to graduate and get an office job that you would be good at. You weren't able to graduate and weren't able to get an office job. And to make things sting even more you had to watch other people celebrating. 

That sucks. That really sucks. And yeah it's absolutely normal and okay to be mourning like you lost something. You never actually had it, but you thought you would. 


 I'm really sorry you're going through that. That you have these medical and mental health issues. That they're causing problems. That you lost out on something that could have been really good for you. I hope you can find a new future that's still good. And that you'll be able to enjoy your future enough that you don't miss the one you thought you were going to have. But until then it's totally okay to feel bad about all of this. 

And even if you end up getting a really cool job that you really enjoy and you have piles of money it will still be okay if sometimes you wonder how things would have been if you were able to graduate now and get that office job. And to maybe feel a bit sad that you didn't get the chance to find out. It should be something you dwell on or that takes over your life. But it's okay to think about it sometimes.
I just want you to know you can go back to college. I have severe mental illness, have had over 50 psych hospitalizations in 8 years, dropped out of college at the beginning of the hospitalizations, lived in group homes for the mentally ill for several years until I stabilized, and went back to college after 5 years and took low credit semesters for 4 more years and just graduated in December. I'm also physically disabled and use a walker or wheelchair and a service dog. It's hard work and now I only need to be hospitalized for my mental health every 6months to a year apart and am going to grad school in the fall. I still do therapy twice a week and see my psychiatrist about once a month. But it is possible if you want it. 

And, it's completely normal to grieve for what you thought was your future. I think we all go through that at some point when we come to terms with our disabilities.
I’m Schizotypal too. 

I never finished college due to my mental health and I have an office job. I’ve been handling workers comp claims in insurance for 9 years now.  

There are other office jobs out there that don’t require a degree. I started at the bottom as a tech and worked my way up to the position I’m in now. 

I would not be able to work if it wasn’t for my accommodations and utilizing FMLA. But it’s a job and my health benefits are good."
"I'm a disabled adult, not a toddler",155,disability,"I'm rather physically able - I can ride a bike, rather intelligent - went to uni, but as soon as they hear I have a severe mental health condition things change. They stop listening to what I have to say, they talk to me like I'm a child and it is so frustrating. If I go to drs with physical health problems they blame it on my mental health even if it's not something that can be caused by a mental health condition. It's ridiculous.

And I see it all the time with my friend who uses a wheelchair. They'll talk to me instead of her. Of course I say 'i don't know, ask her' thing even if I do know the answer. Occasionally she will lose her voice because of her throat condition so I'll ask if she wants me to speak on her behalf. There are a few benefits though like people moving out of her way - if I'm on the bike and she's next to me in the chair people will always move towards me in order to make me change direction instead of her. I joke and say they must have seen her driving or about me being second best.

It's useful on days when my mental health is bad because she lets me use her as a sort of person shield 😂 I'll walk directly behind her if I don't have the ability to navigate crowds.

But yeah, we just want to be treated with the same dignity and respect as anyone else."
Getting divorced due to disability,152,disability,"OMG are you me?? Seriously, I've gone through exactly the same ordeal one year ago. The only difference in my case was that my wife also moved out right away (literally the next morning after telling me she'd leave me) and moved in with another guy 3 weeks later. Turns out they had already been seeing each other for a while. But I don't think he was the main reason she left me. Her main reason was my disability, which has gotten significantly worse during the past 6-7 years. Just like in your case, my wife didn't talk to me about her struggles and when she finally dumped me, she refused to give our marriage another chance. I begged her to go to therapy with me. I made a million different suggestions. I told her she could move out but we could stay married, so she'd feel more free. It was very painful to make these suggestions but I made them anyway. But she just said no to everything.

I, too, wanted to have kids really badly. And although I'm a bit younger than you (34), I'm not sure I'll ever get that chance. I don't even know I'll ever find a new partner. I definitely won't ever find a woman like her... she was the love of my life and perfect in absolutely every way.

I, too, have indescribable regret and I, too, feel a lot of anger. Towards myself, towards her, towards others. I've been seeing a therapist for several years and after my wife left me, my therapist said: ""I saw this coming a long time ago, I should've told you to do something about it before it's too late"". Yet, she didn't. No one told me anything. And I wasn't able to feel it because I was too busy with my disability wrecking my body and soul.

I, too, was very scared of the practicalities. But looking back from 1 year in the future, I can promise you that the practicalities will be figured out. I was very stressed about them in the beginning but I'm now doing pretty well in this department. I'm living a very independent life and I'm proud of that.

What hasn't gone away is the pain and lovesickness. Still today, I think of my ex-wife every single day and I dream of her most nights. I miss her so, so, so much. When I masturbate, I think of having sex with her rather than other women. I know it's not a healthy behavior but I can't help it. It's humiliating, knowing that she's living and having sex with some other guy now but I can't help it. I'd do absolutely anything to get her back. Just like your wife has done, my wife told me some extremely painful things right after she left me. Still, I'd take her back in a heartbeat.

For roughly 9 months I've now been hanging out on various dating apps, trying to find a new partner. But it's fucking hard man. I hate how literally every single woman on every dating app wants a guy who is ""optimistic"", ""positive"", ""cheerful"", ""fun"" etc.. I'm so sick of reading crap like: ""I love my life and you should, too!"" and ""Live, love, laugh!"" - obviously written by able-bodied women who don't have any major problems in their lifes. You're basically not allowed to have any baggage. If you do, you're immediately sieved out. But how CAN'T I have baggage when I've gone through some truly traumatizing experiences thanks to my disability? Just today a girl on a dating app texted me: ""It sounds like you take life lightly and don't worry about the things you went through, is that right? Cuz I like people like that."" How does one even respond to a message like this? If I say: ""yes, that's right"", I tell her a giant lie (something I hate doing). However, if I'm honest and I say: ""Not exactly, of course my disability has taken a serious toll on me"", she'll ghost me right away.

And then, my thoughts are naturally drawn to my ex-wife again. Despite 9 months of intensive dating app usage, I haven't been on a single date and I've had longer conversations with maybe 3 women. It's so indescribably depressing. And so, naturally, I think to myself: ""God, if I still had HER, I wouldn't need to talk to all these clowns on these dating apps."" But I can't even talk to her in a regular fashion because she has completely broken off contact with me. After my wife left me, I asked her if we could at least remain friends but she said: ""No, you'll just use the friendship to ask me for help with something and I don't want to help you with anything anymore.""

So... unfortunately, I don't have much advice to give. As you can tell, my mental health is still miserable. I've been suffering immensely from this break-up. But at least I can empathize with you 1000000%. And just one recommendation: try to find something that gives you joy. I started participating in a theater ensemble. It's not quite easy with my disability but the people in the group are very nice about it. I've always wanted to perform a theater play and now I get to do that this year. They even gave me a lead role, which I'm very proud of. The new hobby hasn't made the pain go away but it has made it at least a little more bearable. I practice at home almost every day and at least during that hour that I practice, I forget about my wife and I focus completely on the material. So... if there's some kind of hobby you can do that would give you joy, maybe you should consider trying that out.

Obviously, I'm incredibly sorry this happened to you. You've got no idea how much I feel you."
Not disabled enough,151,disability,"I'm in the UK and in a similar position with my mental health. Just because some twisted scheme doesn't give you the label of disability doesn't mean you're not disabled by your condition. You deserve help so you can better meet your basic needs while working. I'm really sorry this doesn't seem to be available to you.
I relate to this a lot! Even within the disabled community I am not disabled enough. I have a lot of mental health conditions and am chronically ill. I have a service dog to help me and thanks to him I can work again. But I constantly feel overwhelmed and like I’m doing too much but I don’t have another option. I need money to get the healthcare I need. And to get that money I need to work. It doesn’t matter how dizzy or depressed or weak or exhausted I feel. I have no other option. I am not disabled enough for help, but I’m not able enough to do well. So I’m just stuck
so, I got denied once, almost died and then got it approved by an ALJ the day before I was supposed to have a hearing with her. I have a bunch of physical and mental issues. But I am obsessed and terrified daily that I will lose SSDI because I am close friends with two people who did lose it. And those people seem sick enough that they should still qualify (one has incurable cancer, is an ABK double amputee and was on SSDI, and the other has severe mental health issues and has been hospitalized hundreds of times throughout her life, but was kicked off SSI just because she applied for college. She's still trying to get it back)
yup that would be the beautifully prepared case i mentioned (well documented)... i've been hospitalised a few times and sent to the er even more, but my admittance is not consistent even though i've landed in the er for that or other reasons at least once a year. my documentation is all over since i'm not applying for mental health reasons alone and have seen more doctors than i can count. i also don't have the ability to compile everything myself, even though i do participate as much as i can, so my case, which i foolishly started before getting a lawyer and only got one once the appeal phase started, is over 2 years in. been waiting on a court appeal date for more than half of that because my lawyer requested *closed captions* when i expressed issues with using my voice on video calls.
it was kind of an awful program, all things considered, but when the people treating you for mental health issues blame you for all of it it's hard to fight against that ::p i'm sure i am one among many with these type of experiences. but sure isn't handy for my disability case. i've already had to wait so long i'm out of money next month but, this might mean there'll be no backpay to repay all of that which is... yeah. thank you for humouring me complaining about all of this haha"
Disability and disabled aren’t bad words 😅,152,disability,"Personally, I like “neurospicy”. I use disabled, gimp, neurodivergent, all of it (ADHD, Antisocial Personality Disorder, possible AuDHD, among many other physical and mental health disorders). 

But, being Cajun and having a penchant for spicy things, I like it.
I am physically disabled but also have mental health conditions as well (including ADHD). I don't mind neurospicy, but everyone is entitled to their own thoughts and opinions. That being said disability and disabled absolutely aren't bad words!"

Here is exactly what he said: ""We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally
disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement."" We already have laws that allow for the involuntary confinement of people who pose an imminent danger to themselves or others. This has nothing to do with ""mental health disabilities"" since the vast majority of the mentally ill never commit a violent act.

[Here's his speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVO5GVqtosY), this sentence is at 6:40.
As a nurse that spent 3 years as a prison nurse, I will say that many mentally ill people should be locked up for their own safety and for the safety of others and they are at great expense in our jails. Mentally ill people are in need of help. One of the saddest stories I ever heard was a new inmate telling me that the reason he held up a McD's was he was hungry and couldn't figure out any other way to get food. When he had eaten his fill he told them that they could call the cops. Others that could not on their own take their medication correctly. Saw one guy trying to renew his meds two weeks early at the drugstore because he had already taken them all. 

Many mentally ill people ARE locked up 'involuntarily' and it is the jails that they are in where they get basically no mental health care and when they have served their time, they are released back onto the streets to yet again ""lather, rinse and repeat"". One of our nurses left for a community health position and where she met up again with one of our ex-inmates, and he had been going for his care. He had stayed in jail without parole - his choice - served his whole sentence. One day they found him with a blood sugar reading of a 1000 and for those that don't know, the normal range is around 70-110 or thereabouts. These people can not take care of themselves. The guy that held up the McDs for food, I'm sure that the corporation would have rather given him food that he needed, rather than the possibilities of the tragic outcomes that could have happened. Our mental health system in the USA is a disaster and we should be ashamed that these sick people are left to try and function on their own.  

I see a guy wandering around our town also an ex-inmate that sexually molested his niece and nephew when they were way little. Now he hangs out at the local grocery store or wandering around town. Apparently doesn't have to register as a sexual predator. He has his problems but every time I see him hanging around little children makes me cringe, however, nothing I can do about it. 

Mental health is not the sole purview of any President and reading Trump's post in total shows that he acknowledges that there is a problem and something needs to be done but no one has had the guts to do it yet.

Saying that all Republicans should be locked up is even more inflammatory than anything else here. We all have the right to follow our convictions about politics in our own way and I get so tired of Democrats thinking that they are the only ones  allowed to have opinions or be allowed to function according to their own convictions is doing more to destabilize our country than anything our current, former, and/or next president can do. If you look to the right, one of reddit rules is decency and civility and statements like that from Jeffe333 is certain against the rules.
Not technically during the holocaust since that process is used for describing the systematic killing of Jews.

Video of speech: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVO5GVqtosY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVO5GVqtosY)  
Exact moment he transitions to this ideal: 3:25 - Racism and White Supremacy are addressed. 5:20 - Identify early warning signs. 6:03 - stop violent video games. 6:40 - mental health  laws/treatment/involuntary confinement when necessary. 7:05 - Remove access to firearms for those who pose extreme risk / remove firearms through rapid due process. 7:30 death penalty - quickly - for mass murders.   


For what it is worth, over the last year (Aug 2018-Aug 2019), there were 20 notable mass shootings (defined as those which have made national news, resulted in multiple casualties in the same location, and firearm related). There is no universal criteria for what is considered a mass shooting. Of those 20, 8 were committed by individuals reported as being mentally ill or having some sort of mental disturbance. 4 were committed with racism/political goals/white supremacy motives/ideologies. Crime, Domestic violence, workplace violence, and drug raid make up the remaining 8. With a staggering number having mental health crisis / disturbances as a contributing factor, a change of some sort needs to happen with mental health. I am not saying Trump is right. He's actually far from it. What we need is access to mental health treatment instead of 3-6 month waits for new patients and sometimes 1-3 month waits for current patients with psychiatrists or even several month wait for counselors. Many who reach out for help do so at the lowest point and are turned away because provider shortages/unable to meet demand of the public. Address the underlying issue, it might not fully stop it but it certainly can't hurt anything at this point."

it's really sad how little societal support we have for people with mental health issues like those described above.
It's pretty tricky in workplace settings in particular...while it's harassment & shouldn't be allowed, actually reporting it & getting HR/management to care/do something about it will depend on the culture of workplace, and people's personal whims & biases (if it's employee that's been there longer they are more likely to back them up) and punish you for being a ""troublemaker"" passive-aggressively- giving fewer hours/sticking you in undesirable shifts, or bad times/sections if you're a waiter, not giving you special projects, opportunities for advancement etc."

The pain comes in waves. My mental health is great. But I'm allowing myself to grieve. The thing that hurts the most is not being able to walk my dogs. Even with a chair, I can't walk my dogs. People walk around my house all day. And I have to sit here watching them.

I don't feel like I'm going to wake up better tomorrow. It's only been a month. But I had to quit my job and I'm now excited for a wheelchair. Im just baffled. Absolutely dumbstruck.

I know I'm going to be okay. I want as much independence as I can get. But without my husband, id need to be in a nursing home.

A fucking nursing home. Because I can't fucking take care of myself.

I'm assuming the pain of being disabled will get worse the more I leave the house. I'm not trying to be angry but I'm allowing it too. I know life isn't fair. I'm thankful for the journey of life these days.

I'm just dumbfounded."
Why do I have to defend my existence?,130,disability,"Ugh, I so feel you. I remember that post and it didn’t sit well with me either. I’m so sorry people are telling you essentially that you shouldn’t have been born, even if they don’t mean you directly. I can relate in a way. Even though I quite often struggle with my mental health and finding meaning in life, being told directly or indirectly that people like me shouldn’t live, triggers me intensely."
someone on this sub equated my severe mental disability with “being forgetful and bad at conversation”,128,disability,"My husband and I are both on SSDI, me for mental health issues and him for a severe TBI he obtained from a high elevation fall. We applied and got benefits 10 years apart, both approved at the first stage (so that should tell you how severe our disabilities are; that is, how serious the documentation was).

This was not our plan. We couldn’t believe it when I started failing at my job (he was already on SSDI) and it began looking like I would have to go on disability also, because I was on the fast track to being fired. We never intended for neither of us to be working. We had a small child to raise, suddenly on fixed incomes, at 50% what our family’s previous salary had been.

Long story short, that is not what anyone sees or cares about. We have had pure hatred and vitriol thrown in our faces because we “sit around all day and do nothing.” All people see is a pair of people who look very much like we could be working, home all day every day. What people don’t realize is that we each wish we could be working desperately. We lost our house, both car, most of our belongings, etc, when I was declared disabled. Even worse, I fell into a deep depression upon the loss of my career, one that led to my husband actually leaving me. 

Then I was a single mom on disability with just our son, until the day I had a psychotic break alone with him and as a result, I lost custody of him for 3 years. I missed all of his middle school. So yeah - people may have their challenges with work, but we face our own challenges - and sometimes they’re life-shattering. I eventually got custody back of my son when I remarried his father, a whole other story in itself, but partially which occurred because I was afraid no one else would ever marry me or love me again.

We DON’T just sit around all day. I volunteer as a crisis counselor for two helplines, while my husband, who has more limitations than I do, takes majority care of our home (a small apartment that we are blessed to be able to rent) and our son (who is now 18). I have gotten used to people ghosting us as friends when they find out we’re disabled. Locally, we have my MIL and my parents are out of state but very financially and emotionally supportive. It’s fine - we don’t need anybody else, especially if they’re going to be jealous of how we live without knowing the first thing about it. I have learned to stay in my own lane and count my blessings that we have landed on our feet.
I’m sorry for what you’ve been through - it’s a lot, even for one lifetime. I wish more people could read this and understand. Especially when it comes to mental health, I wonder if people think ‘I get depressed sometimes too, where’s my money’ without having any idea of the havoc severe mental illness (especially psychosis/mania) can wreak on your life. 


Good on you for volunteering with the helpline, too - I think there’s a depth of compassion some people develop after these experiences, and if that’s you, then that’s so valuable. It’s good to hear you’ve got support, too - wishing you all the best. :)"
"When people say “Living well is the best revenge”, how are you supposed to do that when you’re disabled?",126,disability,"It's a stupid saying. The best ""revenge"" is to work on yourself and your mental health to where you no longer feel the need for revenge. Therapy (with a good therapist) is a great place to do this.

We've all been wronged. The people that have wronged us have also been wronged by someone. Your bosses, friends, and exes have been wronged. They've wronged you. You've wronged them. And that's ok! It's a part of being human. We all make mistakes!

It's so important to remember that when people wrong us it's because of their own issues and traumas that have led them to act or react badly. When we ourselves wrong people it's because of our own issues and traumas that lead us to act or react badly. Each and every one of us can always learn and do better! And that's normal and healthy.

At the end of the day, everyone is just trying to do their best in this life. It's healthy to reflect on what people did wrong and what you yourself did wrong and learn from that, but why get revenge at all, when you can wish people the best and focus on being the best you can be?"
How the f*ck do you accept your disability? ,115,disability,"Your post screams depression to me. 

I have been in your position, 2009 I attempted suicide due to the chronic pain I had endured for 13 years. I couldn’t take it anymore. 

However I was able to get to a place of radical acceptance. It takes time and you need to be in a place whereby you are mentally strong. 

Defo consider changing or starting anti-depression meds. Once mine were changed, I felt so much better and gradually the depression began to lift. 

I accept now that my body doesn’t work like other people, and it never will and I’m ok with that. 

It has taken 20 years to reach radical acceptance but I no longer think about or pine for my life before this disability. 

I moderate what I do and listen to my body. I’ll never go ice skating or skiing again but I still participate in hobbies I love, like collecting gemstones and playing the flute. 

It is possible darling, you have to switch your mindset. 

Please do not ever consider suicide. Please. Life is precious even with a disability. You don’t stay in a point of crisis. Being suicidal is being in crisis, and nobody stays in that crisis phase forever. 

Consider getting mental health support, I promise you it’s worth it. 

Sending love and hugs ❤️
Thank you for this harsh truth. I’ve felt such a pressure (even from other disabled folks!) who’s all so positive EMBRACE IT! LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE! LOVE YOURSELF! etc. It makes me mad and it’s so forced. I can’t lie to myself. 

And it’s normal. I mean, I don’t want to hate myself, I don’t wanna d1e from ED, I don’t wanna suffer that much. But i DONT have to be positive and fully accepting of myself. And it’s normal. Maybe I will learn it, maybe it’s a life-long process… who knows. 

I’m trying to be realistic, especially when it comes to my mental health treatment and protocol. I always say to my doctors - please be realistic, don’t lie to me, I know that some things will probably stay forever. Like, you can’t just do lobotomy and forget about trauma or get rid of effect it has on your brain, because it’s permanent. Still - there are things I’m able to change, so I should focus on them."
I'm legally blind. I keep being rejected for jobs in the field of mental health when I mention during interviews that I (obviously!) cannot drive a car to transport clients when needed.,118,disability,"I’m really sorry you’ve had this experience and I hope you find a way to help out and use your skills. I’m from Canada so our agencies might be a bit different but maybe I can provide some insight. Out of our 250 individuals we help support 0% of them are able to drive. So we do require that all support staff can. Even staff who work overnight. One reason for this is that even in Canada, an ambulance ride will cost you big time and our clients are on very limited funds. 

Another reason you might not be getting hired is safety. We tend not to talk about it because it’s unpleasant and can create negative stereotypes but there is a very high risk of being hurt in this field. Not everyone with a disability or mental health issue is violent, but some of them are. We may have a higher % because the ones who aren’t are more likely to live with family members. 

I’ve been working disability support for almost two decades and in that time I’ve been attacked more times than I can count. I’ve been punched, scratched, hair pulled out, stabbed (scissors, knives and pens), strangled, thrown across rooms, had furniture and other objects thrown at me (pears are surprisingly hard when they hit your head), I’ve had fingers broken, been bitten and pinched hard enough to cause permanent muscle damage and my back is beyond repair. All this has happened despite being able to see perfectly and doing my best to defend myself. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to spend a shift dancing around someone trying to help them without getting hurt.
There is also such a thing as a reasonable accommodation. being unable to drive may or may not be due to a disability. In the case of a disability, it seems to me that a reasonable accommodation could be to specifically hire a driver and factor that in to the individual’s pay. The arrangements your workplace allows seem very flexible and equitable. It may be helpful to the OP to be able to document that other workplaces do this, if you’re willing to share irl info with them through a pm or something. Or perhaps just what state you are in.Connecting with Voc rehab , of course, is also a fantastic idea.
Not a PhD or PsyD, just a Master’s degree in mental health counseling (for MFT licensure).
Disability support is an essential service here. The “essential functions” of the job are to help out clients in all aspects of daily living. Either supporting them to be able to do things for themselves or to do the things they absolutely cannot, like drive. I’m not going to get into other means of transportation as that’s a whole thing in itself. 

As for safety. There are jobs that just have risk. If I was a cop of a fire fighter I would expect that I could get hurt on the job. It’s not much different than that. We are trained to watch behavior and react in ways that won’t cause harm to our clients but it’s not perfect. Being able to see facial expressions from a distance is a big help. (I know when that client bites her top lip and rubs her hands on her thighs, I need to be very careful. Don’t put myself in a corner, know where everyone else is and make sure they are safe too) 

I still admire that you want to give back to the community. Have you thought about going into counseling? I know where I live we have only one psychiatrist who specializes in ppl with developmental disabilities and I have yet to find counseling services that specialize. It’s really too bad as there is a high instance of ppl with development disabilities also having mental health issues and psychologists typically just prescribe drugs but don’t help build actual coping skills. 🤷‍♀️ just a thought."
“Respectful Disability Communications” in regards to patient care,116,disability,"Exactly. With how varied people’s opinions are, and how many more important issues we have, fussing about terminology just detracts from the real issues. They want to talk about communication with disabled people? Learn to take us seriously when we have problems or concerns. Confront your own biases about disabled people and other marginalized groups. Train medical professionals to communicate with D/deaf and HOH people, cognitively impaired or language impaired people, people in the middle of mental health crises, etc etc. I don’t know, even just work on presenting pain scales in a more accurate way for people with chronic pain! So many things I can think of that would be much more impactful and important, and yet it always comes back to able-bodied people fumbling around the word “disability”."
"I don't want my disabled ex to be homeless, but I need them to move out. ",111,disability,"Group Home. Try your local mental health agencies. They may have emergency housing.
I Was In Your Ex Situation Unfortunately. I definitely Understand that Especially Financially and Emotionally 

As Taking care of a Disabled Person is Very Mentally Draining 

And Society is Individualistic and Ableist so it makes it no better 

I Tried to help my situation. I reached out to every organization for help

I have Invisible Disabilities as well so people can't see it so therefore I look abled bodied 

I worked jobs Lifting 300lbs 400lbs barrels of water and fruit and vegetables 

Crowded job had panic attacks blurred vision lightheadedness and dizziness 

Everyday at the jobs

Till the fact my body couldn't handle feeling like that everyday 

Plus it was messing with my mental health 

I felt like a burden on family for a issue I didn't ask to have.

Like I understand people Houses and if I can't keep a job 

Which I couldn't I tried but always quitted 

So I got kicked out a lot by family and friends of the family 

Which I understand and stuff 

Really Don't Agree With The ""Learned Helplessness"" thing 

I understand it has some valid points 

But I just personally feel like it's a Individualistic approach or judgement 

To someone that is trying to get their situation atleast for my situation 

I was trying to work jobs getting headaches and Panic attacks just being on the phone 

And I worked a lot of public open jobs 

Which I wished people seem my disabilities so they wouldn't call me lazy or such

Or say things like ""Learned Helplessness"" and stuff 

Because I actually was trying to help myself 

Just I can't control the Disability process 

I can't put a gun to nobody head and say approve me for disability in less than a year 

Or tell a job to get me accomodations that actually benefits me and not the business 

It's so easy to go to Jail than actually trying survive in society

But I understand my Family and friends kicking me out 

Wasn't anything personal it's capitalism 

If I can't bring in a profit or benefit individually to a household or someone life.

I'm a burden and I understand that. Can't Force nobody to help you 

And I understand people mental health just taking someone else in 

Or caring for a disabled person 

Even though I didn't ask to have a disability 

But if it's making you comfortable evict them don't feel guilty 

I understand taking care of people with a disability or just anyone is difficult as well 

Atleast for me I didn't get evicted like that 

Atleast in the black community we don't do all that legal stuff 

They just put a Gun out on you or make physical threats to you 

From my experience 

I left the same day 

Remember my uncle making a threat 

That ""My Shit Better be in the Garage By Saturday"" it was a Thursday that week in 2018

Had to Leave unfortunately 

Which I did plus living with people that doesn't want you there 

Is very mentally draining 

I was scared to leave my room

Because I got threats violent threats 

Because I couldn't keep a job 

Just Disability takes years for people 

Especially non invisible disabilities 

So it took years 

I was seeing my Mental health workers 

Which I was in Georgia so I didn't have insurance 

So they kept supplying me with the same medicine that didn't work 

And I couldn't afford to get the new medicine my doctor prescribed 

I understand you have to do what's best for you 

I know I was trying 

Like I felt like I was a burden and unaliving myself at. That time 

Because I didn't want to be a burden 

I hate being a burden on people 

That's why I'm scared to get in relationships with women 

Because my disability is something I'm trying to figure out 

But I didn't ask for this

Feel like Eugenicists want me dead 

Not trying to trigger anyone 

Just your ex situation sounds like my situation 

But you have to do what's best for your mental health 

I didn't take it personal.

Even though it was family members 

That I couldn't reach out to 

Disabilities in my life is just hard 

Just people don't realize saying Learned Helplessness 

They don't realize it's not too much help as you think 

And plus it's a very huge waiting list 

Sometimes years long

Just getting help is not immediate

Just not enough resources 

Especially for a person like me that couldn't keep a stable job 

Which I felt bad I couldn't 

But people wasn't in my body they couldn't see how I was feeling 

Not trying to trigger anyone
At the end of the day, it isn't your responsibility.  They need to make an effort to either get a job or file for SS disability, section 8, food stamps, Medicaid, and find housing.  You didn't indicate what the disability is.  Are you actually caregiving, like feeding, bathing, etc, or just financial?  You're not family.  Even if you were, it's not worth sacrificing your mental health for this.  It sounds like you have your own family in the home as well.  So they're dealing with this as well?

It's very easy for someone with ""learned helplessness"" to give up and just rely on someone else.  My VA therapist introduced me to that term.  It sounds like your ex is experiencing this.  

""In psychology, learned helplessness is a state that occurs after a person has experienced a stressful situation repeatedly. They believe that they are unable to control or change the situation, so they do not try, even when opportunities for change are available."""
Can we talk about how friends and family leave us because of our disability(ies)?,112,disability,"As someone on the other side, thank you.

I had dated my boyfriend for 10 months when he suddenly had a stroke.
It's now 3 years later and he's doing so well, I'm so proud of how far he's come. 

He's in a wheelchair at times, and has aphasia and right side paralysis.

He's lost soo many friends, it's been heartbreaking.

It's been so hard on him and..it's been so hard on me. Often I feel ignored by others and my struggles and pain are ignored because HE had the stroke.

The impact this has on the loving partner is often ignored and you just have to suck it up. 

And if this happens over and over again and the partner does not look after their own mental health you can end up with compassion fatigue and that really is a relationship killer!"
"Is anyone else with a learning disability sick of hearing about ""growth mindset""?",112,disability,"I experienced this a lot in highschool. I was in an online program that my school provided due to issues with anxiety ADHD that made it nearly impossible to learn in a traditional classroom setting. Basically, instead of attending normal classes, we went to a small building on the school property and worked independently online, having teachers there to help if we needed it. The administrator of this program who also worked as one of the teachers was such a bitch to me about me having ADHD, and when I became severely anorexic which caused even more learning issues due to malnourishment, it got even worse. She had this mindset that anyone who didn't work to her standards just ""wasn't trying,"" no matter what their situation was, and treated people with mental health and/or learning issues like we were being actively malicious and defiant. She always tried to frame how she treated us as ""giving us motivation"" and ""making sure that we worked to the best of our ability,"" but instead of doing any of that, she just treated us like we were supposed to be robots, working nonstop not only in class, but at home as well, with no life apart from schoolwork. 

For example, one day, I was having more difficulty than usual with focusing and was fidgeting a lot. She came up to me and started bitching at me about not working as much as I ""should,"" despite the fact that I was ahead of my classmates in terms of overall progress for the year because I pushed myself to complete as many lessons as I could every day. I apologized and told her that I have ADHD and that I was still in the process of figuring out what meds help me manage my symptoms. She told me, ""No, you're just being insubordinate and don't want to work. If you can't control your ADHD, that's your problem. I should just expell you right now."" She fucking threatened to expell me, which she didn't even have the power to do, because I have ADHD. 

Her behavior continued, despite all the teachers defending me and trying to explain that I not only had a learning disability but was dealing with an eating disorder that caused severe malnourishment. I had learned to ignore her for the most part until my senior year. The shit she said to me made me immediately walk out of class and drop out. A couple weeks before school started, I was in a severe wreck that nearly took my life. The two biggest injuries that impacted my schoolwork was my back being broken in 6 places (can't sit up for very long without severe pain) and a brain hemorrhage (caused cognitive and functional issues). Because of the wreck, I was in the hospital when school started and couldn't go back to school for a few months, which meant I was quite a bit behind on my classwork. When I did finally get back to school, I worked my ass off to get caught up, though it was pretty much impossible when I started so far behind and was still dealing with my injuries, which caused me to need to go home early a lot of days. One day, she came up to me as soon as I got there and immediately started her bullshit. I told her that she couldn't reasonably expect me to have made the same amount of progress as my classmates given my situation. She told me that if I didn't finish my remaining work, at least half a year's worth, in the next 2 months, she wouldn't even allow me to come back next year and finish my classes, and that she would make sure I would never have a chance to graduate from highschool at all. I just gathered my stuff and left because there's no reason I should destroy my mental and physical health to do something that was basically impossible for someone in my position to do, only for me to not be able to graduate anyway. I sent the HS principal an email stating that I was officially dropping out and told him exactly what the program administrator said. Apparently, she got in trouble for it because when I came back to turn in my school laptop, she tried to say she ""didn't mean I actually wasn't allowed to graduate"" and ""was just trying to 'motivate' me."" Telling a student that you'll take away their ability to graduate because they were in a life threatening car wreck which happened to cause them to fall behind on schoolwork is not motivating in any way, it's just fucked up."
people with mental disabilities do you feel like you’re treated weirdly by physically disabled people?,109,disability,"That really sucks, I'm really sorry that's been your experience :( For me, it's been the exact reverse. I am physically disabled (with mental health issues as well but the physical disabilities are much more disabling for me) and I had to leave my school's disability advocacy group because it was full of people with mental disabilities who were ableist towards me with my physical disability -- to list just one example, telling me not to ""complain"" about the distance between my dorm and the dining hall because their dorm was further, when they can walk perfectly fine and I'm the one who skips meals because I physically cannot make it to the dining hall and whose mobility is so bad that I've recently been prescribed a custom wheelchair. I am telling you this not to be like ""um you're wrong actually people with physical disabilities get discriminated against people with mental disabilities 🤓"", not at all. Just to say that unfortunately, any kind of disabled person can be ableist. We always tell abled people that disabled people are not a monolith, and it's true. It really sucks that sometimes disabled people beat down on other disabled people who aren't like them. We really need to stick together and advocate for each other because it only helps everyone in the long run!
(I am both physically disabled and neurodivergent.) I found the opposite to be true actually. There are a lot of folks with mental illness who refuse to identify as disabled. They like to seperate mental illness from disability because they still have internalized ableism. There often conversations and advocacy around ""mental health"" but they *never* identify or view themselves as disabled. 


However, on both sides, there is a long history of disabilities being segregated from each other - charities work that focuses on one disability only. This is in line with the charity and medical model of disability, which wants society to view disabilities as individual medical conditions that need to be cured. Disability people have been taught from the beginning to separate ourselves by ""medical condition"" or individual disability. 


We all need to work on cross-disability solidarity for sure. Some folks with mental health issues need to shed there internalized ableism and not shy away from the disability label. And some visibly physically disabled people need to expand their own definition of disability to include and support folks with invisible disabilities.


It's tough. We've all be taught a bunch of ableism garbage that we need to unlearn. But everyone is at a different stage of unlearning.
Sort of?

In my experience the overwhelming majority of people with physical disabilities are extremely chill and supportive. I mean, mental illness is five times more common in people with physical disabilities, so that dude with the cane probably understands psychiatric conditions pretty intimately, man. In my experience if you tell someone who's stuck at home due to shitty mobility options or whatever that you are also stuck at home due to agoraphobia, their reaction is, nine times out of ten, ""it sucks, right?"" and not ""ACTUALLY I'm stuck at home for real while you're just stuck at home for pretend"" or whatever. Like it happens but it's extremely rare.

With that said, I'm schizophrenic and have run into a lot of disabled people, both physically and cognitively disabled, who only understand that in terms of stereotypes, like the idea that missing a dose makes a schizophrenic dangerous, or that our behaviour in states of psychosis is our ""true selves"" coming out. **I blame the poor public education around mental health** and what psychiatric conditions can really do to people in extreme cases for that, not disabled people as a demographic that should be held to some kind of exceptional standard just because they're disabled, if that makes sense.

Although, if you want to see bad opinions galore, mention body integrity identity disorder. [This is the ONLY chill take I've ever seen on it personally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pyw6ORugUU) ([follow-up video](https://youtu.be/GAouhje5Vm8?si=fr07CLqqIU9ALa4P)) but it's not hard to find old posts of people dunking on ""trans-abled"" people and by extension ""crazy people"" without any empathy or understanding of the psychiatric condition.
I have mental (bipolar II, anxiety) and physical (degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia) and have never been treated differently by people with physical disabilities. 

The people who have treated me the worst were perfectly able bodied, and seemingly mentally stable who were freaked out by mental health disorders and made my life a hell.
As someone who's posts could be taken this way sometimes I think some clarification is needed. While I can only speak for myself and the opinions I have offered, it's not a case of diminishing or bashing mental health as an inferior or lesser form of disability. 

My bugbear is people who are self diagnosing based off of stuff like ""I watched some tiktoks and they convinced me I have ADHD/bipolar/ocd but no Dr will sign me off so I cant get benefits.""
I make myself feel weird bc society (social services, mental health professionals, peers) think my disabilities can be cured or are just a rough patch in life.
For me it’s hard to not envy other physically disabled people because of how much my physical symptoms are shrugged off as being in my head. A friend of mine was in the same boat; physically and mentally disabled but having her physical symptoms shrugged off and her concerns ignored while being accused of being a hypochondriac. Then one day about a year ago she had a grand mal seizure. Finally they couldn’t ignore her anymore and she’s got specialists for her physical AND mental health assigned to her now. 

I’ve been being gaslit for years over physical symptoms that are just getting worse and worse. Even though I’ve actually had a psychiatrist *and* a psychologist confirm that they’re not ‘in my head’, I continue to be gaslit and shrugged off. Now, am I to the point that I wish I’d just collapse with some major symptom so they **have** to stop gaslighting me? You bet your ass. Do I actually *want* my symptoms to get that bad? Obviously not. I’m just so desperate and tired of being brushed aside because someone slapped a diagnosis on me that the medical community thinks means I’m a ‘troublemaker’.

But this is all to do with how doctors treat me while having both. I’ve never had another disabled person invalidate me.
It's also been the same for me. I have both, but primarily physical disabilities (chronic illnesses) that precede my mental health issues. 

I think that the most frustrating aspect for mw js when people try to frame mental illnesses like ""What if you had a disability nobody could see!? People never say this ableist stuff to people with physical disabilities!!"" And I'm sitting here with my invisible illnesses like 😬
I think it’s also worth mentioning that, contrary to (seemingly) popular belief, a majority of physically disabled people aren’t neurotypical. Many of us have developmental disorders (e.g. autism or ADHD), and it’s also very common to develop mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. as a result of our experiences as physically disabled people (many of us experience abuse from family or our partners, get bullied by our peers, or have medical trauma). Hell, sometimes we even start out with mental health conditions that end up causing or contributing to our physical health problems! (Psychological trauma is thought to play a part in some health conditions, such as fibromyalgia, autoimmune diseases, etc.)

Able-bodied mentally disabled people have a lot more in common with physically disabled people than they may think, but a lot of them still accuse us of being neurotypical when we push back against their ableism toward us. It’s very frustrating. Showing solidarity would be a lot more helpful to the both of us in the long run, but othering and attacking us isn’t productive at all.
Honestly? I'd bet on internalized able-ism. I was guilty of it for a lot of years as a kid. My sibling was higher support needs than I, and I was got so angry he couldn't just lie or mask like I did. Like ""don't you want to be *normal?*"" ""Just lie it's not that hard!"" ""Come on and just stop doing that!"" Which I've apologized profusely for and adapted for. 

So there's a lot of ""we can choose to mask, we should 'try to be normal', why do you get special language and recognitions and supports?!"" kind of lashing out without understanding the parallels that exist there. For  instance: my sibling is just starting to pick up on spoon theory for Autism and anxiety. And mobility aids aren't very different from stimming aids, and both are discriminated against. 

I'd also argue there's a huge lack of recognition about how physical disabilities were fought for and still are constantly because they see the effects of the ADA every single day. But a lot of people don't understand that Autism wasn't recognized 25-30 years ago and the supports they have now were not the norm - that is to say that we are all *still* fighting.  And there's half a dozen posts every week that talk about invisible disabilities being ignored because the media portrays them as being easy to take care of.

There's likely also the ""well I was born with this, *you* developed it!"" resentment which is so utterly ironic because on the physical side you have older people telling you that ""you haven't earned your pain, you're too young/didn't work a hard enough job/have kids/whatever justification"" on top of genetic conditions. 

And most importantly: intersectionality! LGBTQ+, racial minorities, mental health, physical health, and abuse victims often check multiple boxes. We all are parallels of each other and all have similar struggles. And we have to band together because this is just another way to keep us divided and unable to fight for our rights."
Do you ever feel fake with your disability?,106,disability,"I have multiple mental health issues ranging from PTSD, anxiety, depression, and severe insomnia. I have sensitive asthma to the point where I’ve been in the hospital for it multiple times or had to go the ER. Most of all I’m Type 1 diabetic and the amount of people who tell me thats a fake disability never ceases to amaze me. Idk any other auto immune disease thats not curable and you’re forced to spend $1000+ to survive monthly. Like I don’t have insulin then I’d just die. Of course no one cares here in America as long as ur paying Big Pharma. Having your blood sugar too high feels like shit having it to low feels like shit. I’ve puked out my brains for hours and days at a time due to low AND high blood sugars. I’ve gone to the hospital more times then I can count bc the insurance refusing to cover my medical supplies causing me to go into DKA. Fun fact: One time this happen and my boyfriend (at the time) was screwing my mother in my car in the parking lot of the hospital… geeee I wonder how I got all those mental health issues. 🤔 (yes thats meant to be funny bc idk how tf else to handle all this trauma but obviously thats not all that caused it)
You aren’t though just so you know. For me a lot of my disabilities are not seen like my mental health bipolar,cPTSD, severe anxiety, and adhd. The other are health related like my hashimotos, heart conditions,Ibs, severe asthma, essential temors, and much more. So, on days when I feel a little bit better it’s hard for me to feel not like I’m faking or it’s just not so bad even though I’m still trying to figure out another health condition I might have."
AITA for telling her to stay in her lane?,105,disability,"Im disabled with mental health issues. I am ABSOLUTELY ALLOWED TO JOKE ABOUT MY DISABILITY AS ARE YOU. The audacity of some “professionals” is hilarious- she should accept being upset, we have to a million times in our lives. Especially since she WAS way out of line. The moment i left group If have contacted someone to file a complaint. Joking about a disability is NOT equal to putting yourself down and that person sounds ill fitted for their job tbh
I don’t like to frame things in an AITA way. I think it is a hindrance for resolving the actual issues at hand, and pushes people into their corners rather than restoring or developing a sense of understanding.

There seem to be a few issues here: 

1- Is it ok for people with disabilities to use humor that we direct at ourselves or in a mutually agreed upon way among each other?

Again, I want to get away from judgements about “ok” or “not ok.” It is a thing some people with disabilities do, and some people don’t. Some people will feel offense— all, some, or none of the time. Some people will feel relief, connection, etc—all, some, or none of the time. This is just the way it is. Then question then becomes, what is a helpful way to facilitate a conversation among people with different feelings, perspectives, and abilities?

2- Is it ok for a person who does not have a disability to feel offended by jokes made by people with disabilities about their disabilities?

Just as with anybody else, feelings are feelings. See above.

3- Is it ok for a person to tell you how *you should* feel about a joke you make about yourself?

A person telling you how you “should” feel about something doesn’t change the way you “do” feel about it. It usually has the opposite impact and makes you defensive of your feelings or perspective, causing you to cling onto them even harder.

4- Is it helpful to talk about one’s unease with jokes somebody makes about themself?

It depends on how one goes about it and how the other person receives it. Sometimes it can be helpful, and sometimes it will become unproductive. If both people (or the group) have an intention of listening and hearing each other out without judgement and allowing room for everyone to “be,” than it can be a workshop for developing understanding, even if people still disagree at the end of the converation.

This kind of communication can be a challenge, even for people in the best state of mind. For people who are experiencing mental health problems, it can be really challenging to feel triggered and not become reactively defensive. Some people may be able to practice skills that make it a bit easier to manage their triggers in a more productive way, and some have less capacity for it. For those who have some capacity to do so, these skills can help diminish triggers from turning into unmanageable emotional cascades.

5- Is it helpful for a therapist (or anyone) to tell a client (or anyone) to shut up.

No. Maybe only in the very rarest circumstances where silence is needed for safety and the two people have a very trusting relationship already.

6- Is it helpful to tell someone you disagree with that they are “out of their lane?”

Usually not. Not if you are interested in having a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas. If you just want to push someone away in defense, it can go either way. The other person may either back off, or they may respond by escalating the situation further. It’s a gamble.

&nbsp;

7- Who was wrong...were you out of line...were they out of line, etc?

That’s really impossible to judge based on only hearing one side of the story. I’m cautious to jump on the “they are the a-hole” bandwagon, because I don’t think it will really be helpful to you in moving forward with what’s next. 

What you may want to consider, is being self reflective in a way that is kind toward yourself but also recognizes if there are ways you may have contributed to the breakdown of communication. If you feel able without getting easily triggered back into a defensive posture, apologizing for your part can sometimes loosen others up to apologize for theirs. It still may not, but practicing that skill can still be helpful for you regardless of what the other person does, **if** it doesn’t send you into a defensive spiral if they don’t respond the way you hope (which they are unlikely to do 100%, but 10% is really good.) You have to judge where you are with your own mental health and capacity. If you don’t feel able to approach the person, it can help to write it down, even if you don’t end up giving it to them, as long as you are kind to yourself in the process. 

Sometimes these kinds of challenges can be an opportunity to develop other skills that are helpful besides humor (when it goes well.) The more tools one has, the less conflicts one tends to get into that create problems in relationships. Conflicts can be more easily resolved and nobody has to be the a-hole. We can all just be human.
Honestly, it sounds like your therapists are having a power trip (both of them). 

This reminds me of feminists that put down other women for their choices; this is why I detest third-wave feminism. 

They claim to be about ""self-empowerment"" and ""choices"", but then if a woman wants to stay home, wear dresses, and bake pies and cookies, she's ""disempowering the rest of woman-kind!"" (because she won't wear pants and work outside the home). 

It's actually not dissimilar to what cults do. 

Step 1), pick an issue that correlates to a certain demographic that doesn't have a universal answer (in this case, is it acceptable to laugh at your disabilities? a = yes, b = no) 

Step 2), claim that, if such and such *does* a, they'll be disenfranchising the people that chose b (while conveniently ignoring the disenfranchisement of those that chose a)

Step 3), collect your paycheck at the end of the day for disenfranchising half of the very group you're claiming to help (because you know better than the people that are actually part of that demographic)

It's mob mentality. They're talking about ""Carrot"" like she's not even there; like her thoughts and feelings on her own condition are ""less relevant"" than what the therapist thinks about it. 

But than again, that's most the mental health field; people acting like their subjective evaluations of the human condition are scientific laws, rather than just another opinion.
Window of tolerance? It’s the only mental health window I can think of lol"
Pretty sure my wife left me because of my disability.,105,disability,"I don’t know if it was as much as « not fun anymore » as it might have been completely overwhelming to her. My recent ex-husband knew I was disabled & was a bastion of support for me. But when I had a nervous breakdown & was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder, it became completely overwhelming for him. He tried to support me & we tried to make it work but ultimately it degraded his mental health (and mine). It hurt both of us but thankfully we were able to stay friends. Caregiving is extremely draining work which is why people get paid to do it.

With that said, please don’t think you’re not worthy of love. I’m now in a loving relationship with someone I was friends with for years and who has more experience with disabilities given that he is neurodiverse himself. Everyone is different & just because your ex-wife couldn’t handle it doesn’t mean no one else can. Lots of good wishes to you. 💜
Your story is a reminder to me that I should be mindful of how my life and my behavior affects my partner.  I'm disabled and also deal with mental health issues, but he's been immensely supportive.  We've been together for 10 years, so it's easy to take them for granted and assume that they'll always be here for us.   This is a reminder that this is not the case - they can become overwhelmed and can leave us."
I miss enjoying my free time,104,disability,"I don't honestly miss being busy, as my mental health recovers and I'm not dealing with a long term traumatic situation anymore I don't mind having the few hours when I'm not sick or sleeping open to just be and to do the things I want.

What I *do* miss is the *ability* to do things. I miss not only taking a full college courseload and learning but also being able to read more than one book in a week. I miss not just being able to run a 5k in 21 minutes but also being able to walk around the mall for however long I wanted without having serious repercussions the next few days. Hell, I miss when playing sims or going to the library or practicing flute wasn't an uphill battle just to *start*. 

I think that's the reason I do value my free time. Because I have a full time job just being sick and in pain from my disabilities, so the few hours I do have that I've managed to wrest from the hands of depression and anxiety and ADHD are *mine* and I deserve to have a chance to just exist and be happy, since I haven't had that chance for the past nearly 10 years.
That’s just shitty parenting. My child has some of the same mental health problems that I have. He is medicated and has been in therapy since 5 or 6. 

When your kid needs help, you get them help. Hard stop. To not do so is negligent."
Medical Assisted Dying: Does it freak anyone else right out?,99,disability,"On one hand, I’d accept it in a heartbeat. After three suicide attempts, that sounds like a dream come true. I have treatment resistant depression and over 10 years of treatment hasn’t done much. On the other hand, I am poor af and can’t really afford all the snazzy new treatments that they’re offering now so maybe that’s why. Which brings up the point… desperate people (like me) will die when they don’t actually need to. Regardless of my severe mental health issues, many people will say that it’s a bad thing when people who could have lived healthy lives are instead killed because they are part of a specific bracket like poor. Canada might not go down that path, I don’t know. But if they start offering this in USA, very specific demographics will 100% be targeted.
I am all for The Right to Die. Doctor assisted suicide. But there is a slippery slope. Is there a link that I can read up on it? The mental health aspect of it?

My issue with doctors is: Say I've been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the doctors push and push me to undergo surgeries, chemo, radiation, whatever to extend my life...The doctors NEVER ask a person, ""do you want to live?""
I don't think it should be allowed for mental health. Unless it's treatment resistant depression, I see no reason. It just stigmatizes getting mental health treatment and working on it, people just will choose this path.

I have pathological depression that's not treatable with anto depressants, pretty much the term isn't used, but it's because my depression was caused by a TBI. 

It's different than depression that's caused by a chemical imbalance that can be treatable.

I also think this sets a slippery slope because at what point does it go and become physician assisted homicide when a person pushes the individual to do it.
For me I feel the current treatment of mental health is impaired to pharmaceutical companies pushing meds.
For me I met the criteria for MAID under mental health that was non-treatable! However, a few years ago I started receiving testosterone treatment for fertility and low and behold my chronic depression/bipolar cleared up and I'm successfully ""cured"" of my previous condition.
What I'm trying to get at is when I told my psychiatrist and DR. About the changes they said it doesn't work that way here try these meds! I have been off my meds for over a year now and I am doing better now than anytime in the last 10 years of treatment for my ""treatment resistance"" depression 
Well low and behold there are proven studies about the effects of improper hormone levels on mental health and I feel that there will be people like me who will qualify for MAID when all they need is a simple shot and follow up therapy to come to terms with the suffering they had under mental health. 
What we need is a mental health overhaul and update!
No.  You're not those people, claims about ""other options"" are wild speculation from people not actually involved with the treatment of the patients.  Wherever it's been made legal it's a long complicated process with tons of checks in place, not just someone ticking off a box.  The idea a ""cranky burned out doctor"" is going to go through the massive complicated effort involved in approval just isn't a real concern.  Following the idea of denying something because of the remote off chance it might be used inappropriately can be used to justify not allowing anything.

And you or some journalist or anyone not directly involved with a patients treatment extensively, with access to all their private information, records, and everything else, and with the appropriate training and knowledge, have zero right to decide if a person with mental health problems should or shouldn't seek assisted death.  It is as absurd as people who tell someone suffering from mental health issues to ""just exercise and you'll cheer up"".  You're not that person, you're in no position to make a judgement about anything.  No one but that patient and the professionals involved have any right to make that decision for them.

You don't get to decide for another person if their life is or is not worth living.  You don't get to decide for another person if they should or should not pursue other ""options"".
I have significant mental health issues as well as a rare, life limiting, often terminal genetic disease and I think people deserve the right to decide when the pain of living, be it physical or mental pain, outweighs any quality of life. Of course this needs to be done with qualified physician guidance and oversight, as well as documented attempts at treatments that have failed, but in the end it’s far better to allow someone to die with dignity than to force them to resort to far more painful options that can end up increasing suffering if they fail or to suffer far longer than necessary. If we respect someone’s autonomy over their body, that really needs to include their right to decide (under the mentioned circumstances) whether or not to continue their life. 

I do not live in a state with any form of death with dignity or assisted suicide, and the thought of how painful my life may become both physically and mentally (I have tried almost every medication available for bipolar disorder, severe anxiety, ptsd, etc and have been told we may be near the point where there are no other options to try) terrifies me. I have had to live within this broken body, I fight daily for quality of life, it should be my right to decide when it’s enough and I no longer want to live in constant pain. 

Sorry, this topic hits too close to home for me so I kind of vented.
The article I added above discusses this. By and large MAID patients have been privileged people seeking the same control of death that they had in life but those suffering from severe mental health problems are often impoverished and have histories and existing realities that include complex trauma. Like…we’re passing seemingly careless MAID legislation before fixing social housing problems and having a decent mental healthcare system. Like…maybe trusting patients and giving them an opportunity for autonomy will prevent people from doing it themselves which will give them access to mental health care. But I’m scared this will be abused.
I feel you on this and if I ever don't have any family members in my life anymore (as in they get old and die).  I too have a brain injury and have chronic pain.  MAiD is my backup option but I think I probably qualify for having a mental health issue too. 

If I had money for treatment that would be great.  Right now my disability probably doesn't pay for me to live in a comfortable quiet housing to not cause my symptoms to go up.  It really sucks.
This is my fear as well. Most people with severe mental health problems are being failed by the system and now the system is trying to give them an out.
I’ve been wondering about bias. The one above seems pretty balanced, though. I know ‘we’re not ready’ is often a tactic for people trying to stop things altogether but the optics of rushing this out when mental healthcare isn’t great is pretty bad.
Sound word for word what I have and promised my parents. Unfortunately I also have other disabilities as well. Currently in the process of applying for it. My.docters are not on board. Over a year later and they are still having me talk with ""advocates"" who try to find resources and help. All the advocates have been able to do is give me information for things that do not apply for me.... 
It is not easy to even have doctors think about it. They say you are not required to try every possible treatment, that what they want you to do and will not start it untill you do (my experience).  Almost 30 years with mental health trauma related. Over 15 physical, born with neurological. Every year a new issue arises, not I have one covid to add, and haven't had a day without painful migraines for months (almost constant migrane going on since 2018).
The mental health angle makes it so complex. It sounds like there’s a good way to approach this. I’m just worried Canada is rushing it for reasons I’m not clear on.
The issue here is that the current proposition does not have a long complicated process. MAID for mental health reasons is currently only legal in the Netherlands where mental healthcare and healthcare in general gets far more support/funding than in Canada and has far more of a process than is being proposed.
Dying isn't the only way to end the suffering. It is the most permanent one, though, and in the depths of depression or other mental health crises, it may seem like the best option. 

Suicide survivor. I'm ever grateful I was given treatment and not help in killing myself. I would have gladly chosen death at the bottom of my mental abyss, but instead I was given help and support I had never had before. I wasn't making logical decisions when I was in crisis. Just grasping at emotional straws.
I think the reason it’s different is that mental health conditions often make people feel like it’s hopeless. Also there’s still stigma around mental health and it’s poorly supported.
I’m conflicted on this. The class/income disparity issue is a massive issue. Kind of how rich are “eccentric” but the poor are “crazy.”

On the other hand, I’m a doctor and even when well resourced and w good support systems, some people’s mental health issues are crushing. I really don’t know how I would feel about signing off on something like this.
It will be interesting come March, how doctors make their decision and all. Does Canada have a lot mental hospitals? Or are there waiting lists for that too?

I had a stay in one here in the US and I'll BE DAMNED if I ever put myself through that again, it was like prison. I would be scared this new MAID for mental health would be a trick and I'd be locked up again.
And throw other mentally ill people who want to live but struggle financially under the bus? The system is so broken. No.

**Build a functioning mental healthcare system, expand access to mental healthcare and THEN we can have this expanding MAID to mental illness discussion. With heavy safeguards in place - right now there are none.**
I’m a physician and trying to learn more about this kind of thing. The mental health issue piece is not palatable for me at all and as you say - groups will be marginalized. Checking out that website.

In broader terms…is there an “ideal” MAID model?  I had an end stage Huntington’s patient writhing on a bed as he attempted to hang himself with his sheet and bite off his tongue…there was nothing I wanted to do more than help him with what he was trying to do in a less painful way.

I’m conflicted. As some have said, the medical community can be very patronizing and short-sighted in their definition of “quality of life.” But for some patients…it does really seem like this might work out?
US mental health facilities are atrocious.  “Therapeutic environment” my ass.
Not saying it shouldn’t be an option. But it feels like the way it is implemented says more about the intent. I’d much rather someone who wants to die do it in a safe and supportive environment rather than improvising at home where it’s going to cause more trauma to other people. I’d also much rather the request start a general mental health conversation rather than someone going it alone in a bad headspace. That’s not what this feels like to me."
"Which do you prefer for yourself: ""have a disability"" or ""disabled""?",102,disability,"Not to come at you, but you consider your autism as a mental health thing? I'm also autistic- I can understand arguing it's not a disability, but arguing it's a mental health problem sounds like you're expecting your autism to be ""cured"".
For myself personally, I prefer identity-first over person-first. I'm AuDHD, have the fun ""twice exceptional"" thing of gifted but also learning-disabled, have EDS, dysautonomia, probably some mast cell issues, have had mental health struggles to a disabling extent before, some weird neurological issues of unknown origin, sort of all hitting me in different ways at various points in my life. I didn't really identify myself as being disabled until my late teens/early 20s but even at that point it was so clear to me that this shift in how I navigate the world has profound impacts on the way I think and approach problems in ways that can't be separated out from ""me as a person"". To attempt to distance myself (or for other people to distance me) from my disability is to pick and choose the parts of me worth ""humanizing"", or at least that's how it feels to me.

I also personally kind of get the ick from person-first because although well-meaning, 1) if anyone needs reminding that disabled people are people, they're the problem, and 2) it feels like wanting to separate the two out comes from the assumption that disability is intrinsically negative/shameful, like people want to detach you from a stigmatized term instead of destigmatizing the term. Maybe this is just me projecting because my extended family very much treated my embracing of my disability as like, me somehow insulting myself or putting myself down or underestimating my own potential/self-sabotaging?? ""You can do anything you want to if you put your mind to it!"", except no, learning that I have limits, and why I have those limits, and hiw to work around/withing those limits has been more freeing than trying to dissociate myself from disability ever has been. ""Disabled"" is a neutral modifier to me and in my experience most of the able-bodied people uncomfortable with me using it or pushing person-first are struggling with some ableist mentality even if it's not intentional/realized.

Linguistically I also just dislike person-first because it feels weird. I'm not a ""person with queerness"", etc. All that said, I can also understand why certain people/groups tend to prefer person-first and I'll always use what people prefer. In my own academic work on disability where I'm often describing all disability writ large, I usually alternate/use both, recognizing that there's people on both sides of the fence. My own personal feelings/preferences don't make other people's feelings or preferences wrong. It's a very personal choice.
I believe that it is more widely and kindly accepted to use person first. I should say that my opinion on that may come from the fact that I worked as a behavioral specialist for 23 years before having to leave due to SFN and what ended up being an entire group of other related diseases. Mental Health industry definitely pushes for a person to be what we see first, and therefore speak of first as well. 

I went out of work 2 years ago and it still drives me crazy but there’s no way I could ever do the work again, or anything productive in the work force again. 

I don’t get offended at all if someone refers to me as a disabled person or as disabled, but it bothers me to hear other people referred to that way. I’ve head so often people referred to as “the wheel chair person” or something like “he is ADHD” or a number of other ways. Regardless I work to always speak in a way that is kind to everyone.
Person first language is heavily used in the mental health field. It is important to remind people that all people deserve to be seen and treated as people, not only as the disability they have. I spent 25 years in the mental health field - 23 of those years as a behavioral specialist. You would likely be surprised how often people need to be reminded that. That said I use it across the board, unless someone has expressed they would like me to say something different.
It makes sense to use it at first until someone says hey I prefer this, given that there really isn’t one exact answer as to which one is the correct phrasing. 
However for me specifically, when I’m talking about myself, using language to help remind people they’re speaking to a human feels weird because like they’re either able to see it or not and I’m not going to be of that much assistance. 

Tbh it feels different in the mental health field because of how incredibly stigmatized it is and the fact that people will use diagnostic labels for mental illnesses as jokes. 
It does feel more dignified to say “person with SUD” than “drug addict”. 

Maybe people needing to be reminded that we’re human is just a sad reality. I just don’t know how much the way I talk about myself can change a person who is so quick to dismiss my personhood. It genuinely seems like that’s something a person would have to do some soul searching about in order to figure out why they’re doing that. 

I don’t really care what way people refer to me, if theyre using PFL that’s probably what they were taught to use and have been saying for years, I’m just throwing a wrench in there and making things more confusing. I’m bipolar and I don’t think u would notice if someone referred to me as a bipolar person or a person who has bipolar disorder. 

But I’m sure the distinction matters significantly to a lot of people and it’s more delicate to use person first in a psych setting. Especially for newly diagnosed individuals. 


In the context of how one chooses to refer to themselves I feel uncomfortable with the idea that someone dehumanizing me would be changed by my verbiage. Most of the time it’s a non issue but I have been corrected on the way I refer to myself before and that was especially irritating because it felt like it was placing the onus on me to convince people I’m human. 
It’s not a simple issue and it does depend a lot on how stigmatized it is, I just don’t feel like making communication clunkier, already so hard to get my thoughts across at all that extra level of complexity is just too much and there’s so much social stuff wound up in just the phrasing of something. Too much. They can just go ahead and dehumanize me."
Just had the Psych eval for disability...,93,disability,"Husband here.

The man was an absolute ass. He kept making the point that he had a list of questions to answer with limited time so he derided Ren constantly about explanations that he determined were irrelevant to the question being asked. He made jokes from his own perspective and when called out on for using the term Shrink for mental health professionals (which we found to be grossly unprofessional compared to his strict timetable), he doubled down saying that he is one and its a term that gets used between them. ""I have thick skin so it doesn't bother me. I don't see why you're offended by that word.""

I was floored by his inability to speak alongside us in the conversation. It's one thing to stick to a protocol for government work, but this was demanding my spouse be quieted and carved into the correct shape to fit the box while he prattled on about what he found amusing between questions.

The only good things to come out of this are a completed form and the confirmation of diagnoses. And yes, I was very tempted to become violent at his dismissal of the beginnings of a panic attack from Ren. The complete lack of human empathy and the underlying expectation of power and obedience to him was disgusting.
I had a guy who did my evaluation be not only somewhat dismissive but when I got denied and appealed, I looked at his report… he said I had a hair color I don’t, ruddy skin, and my mom was PHYSICALLY WITH ME. At the appointment. I think he was hallucinating because I have a very different hair color, very clear skin, and my mom never left her car. How was she in the office with me?! 

He proceeded to say in this report that dyslexia wasn’t real and it didn’t apply to me. I have documented proof of 25+ years  of MANY multiple people giving me an unquestioned dyslexia diagnosis. He said my mom (who wasn’t there) and I were trying to “convince” him I was disabled. He fucked up my whole evaluation and got me denied. I’ve got a stack of documents, inches thick, documenting over 25+ years of various learning disabilities, mental health problems, and physical health issues. 

These people are wild.
There are a lot of crap professionals in the mental health field.  Sorry you got a bad one.  I was so impressed with mine, that I looked to see if my insurance covered him.

"Adults with disabilities were far more likely to report serious mental health concerns, substance use, or serious suicidal thoughts and difficulty getting treatment during the #COVID19 pandemic",90,disability,"**Summary**  
*What is already known about this topic?*  
Adults with disabilities experience higher levels of mental health conditions and substance use than do adults without disabilities.  
  
*What is added by this report?*  
During February–March 2021, 64.1% of surveyed U.S. adults with disabilities reported adverse mental health symptoms or substance use; past-month substance use was higher than that among adults without disabilities (40.6% versus 24.5%, respectively). Among adults with a diagnosis of mental health or substance use conditions, adults with disabilities more frequently (43% versus 35%) reported pandemic-related difficulty accessing related care and medications.  
  
*What are the implications for public health practice?*  
During public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced mental health and substance use screening among adults with disabilities and improved access to related health care services are critical.
This report and many others points out the need for expanded access to mental health and substance use disorder services, but disabled folks in the US are busy fighting tooth and nail to keep what paltry services we already receive."
Government disregard for disabled lives in 2022 pandemic,94,disability,"I'm right with you in Victoria. Everyone is 'learning to live with covid' and I have so many questions with no answers. Do I just stay inside indefinitely? Do I never see friends again? Do I not go get my teeth fixed this year like I planned? Is it safe to attend cardiologist appointments now? How do I get the medicine I need without going on public transport and risking getting covid? 

It's all so depressing and disabled people are not being offered any extra support. The mental health system is also so overwhelmed I have no options for crisis mental health care."
Wife wants to work from home some days due to mental disability. Was rejected for a weird reason i think. Any ideas?,90,disability,"It isn’t a disability app, though. It’s an accommodation through her workplace. Ugh"
Do you ever feel that because of your disability that you need to be more ruthless?,92,disability,"I feel like it's possible to be ruth-neutral in this regard. At least, that's what I aim for. I am not usually a dick, but I will do everything I have to do to make sure my situation is understood. For example, making sure everyone in HR knows my diagnoses and their symptoms, in appropriate medical terminology so as to be polite, even when they can't ask about them and don't want to know anyway (and they really, REALLY don't want to know, but I NEED them to know, you know?). Like, if I need some sudden PTO due to needing to see my doctor, then I'll mention what type of doctor it is and what's being treated. (If any of them ask me not to be so detailed because it makes them uncomfortable, then I make sure I know who doesn't like it and won't do it again if I talk to them, but they can't unknow it after I've already spoiled the beans.) Same with the employee calendar -- I'll mark myself out-of-office and explain the same way in the ""Reason"" field.

That's not the only situation in which I feel like it helps, but employment is a good example of needing to cover your ass as much as possible when you have a life-upending condition. I call it ""belligerent disability"", if only for the reason that other people seem to find it rude or downright hostile to discuss health, be it physical or mental health, out in the open and with total candor. There are people (essentially, everyone) who are going to make assumptions about you based on what you do or what you don't do without regard to your illness, because they won't consider it a possibility; the default state is to be well. I gave up being embarrassed or shy some years ago now in matters of health for that very reason: Everyone needs to understand the true nature of disability, how any random person could have a disability, and how expectations of a person's limitations due to disability can be both confirmed and thwarted, even between two people with the same disabiling condition(s).

That said, Theodore Roosevelt once said ""Speak softly, and carry a big stick."" I have the capacity to be ruthless if I have to be. (Insurance comes to mind.) I may never use it, but I like having information and I like planning ahead for possible unpleasant scenarios so I can make them, at the very least, equally unpleasant for the other parties involved. One of the best ways I've found to do this is to make yourself increasingly unpleasant to deal with, by steps so the ratcheting effect is less noticeable, all the while signaling how much easier the other person will have it if they just lay off already. For instance, it seems like the state of Arkansas is freaking the fuck out because I take opipd pain meds and an anti-anxiety medication, and now it looks like I'm going to have to do separate consultation each with my psych, my pain specialist, and my pharmacist. The psych and pain doctors, I've been seeing for years now; they know I have not been abusing either medication, nor other medications in breach of my opiod use contract. They know my entire health record, and how each medication improves my life. They know that potential interactions at the prescribed dosages are not occurring, and have both given me plenty of information each year as required on things to watch out for, such as seizures, respiratory distress, and seratonin syndrome. The only new factor here is the pharmacy, since Walmart recently decided not to fill the pain doctor's medications, as they seem to believe he is prescribing way more than he ought, in spite of the fact that both major medical networks out here have begun requiring primaries and specialists to farm out chronic pain management to pain specialists specifically, so literally every pain management doctor is suddenly doing bigger numbers overall, even if the percentage of prescriptions of varying types does not change for that doctor. So, I think it's thanks to this new place, who gave me quite a lecture over the phone I'm sure I sounded riveted by, that these consultations will be happening. I'll need to make sure the new place has my complete medical history as well.

Sorry – I've clearly begun to rant. Or rather, been ranting for awhile. I guess all I'm saying is have a stockpile of information you're ready to use, up to and including if it means pushing the proverbial nuclear launch button. Practice good belligerence on your part though by staying informed on your condition, your treatment, your symptoms, and the resolutions you want out of medicine and society, and you'll probably ultimately be left alone insofar as people raising much fuss over your disability."
Discriminated against by my therapist in front of others,92,disability,"This makes me so mad!
Writing something down should always be a possibility. Not allowing it isn't beneficial for anyone.
And the therapist should not be telling you to try harder in a situation that you have a solution for! It's pointless to force his way of doing something onto you. Remembering it isn't better or than writing it down as long as you can acsess the information it is fine. That he continued treating you like this after you  disclosed your disability and explained that memory issues are a part of it is disgusting! He should not be treating you like this especially as a mental health professional, who should understand the impact of public shameing and discrimination!
Definitely discusses this situation with your therapist and explore if their is a way to report this situation. Depending on the setting there might be a supervisor you can report his behavior to!
Literally everyone answered that question with ""well you'd be like most mental health professionals then..."" or ""yeah that'd be fine why would that bother us"" but that didn't seem to make a difference... Schoolchildren indeed, it seems."
I'm sick and tired of being disabled,87,disability,"This is why the whole anti suicide propaganda and therapy being shoved down our throats straight pisses me off. 

That argument always assume it has everything to do with self esteem and solely with mental health. What about those who are disabled and will constantly suffer every single day, regardless of the supports they receive? This argument completely ignores the reality of anybody suffering from things that simply put, cannot be cured. 

Sorry, I have nothing bright to add. Just that I strongly relate and I feel your pain.
Thank you. I appreciate your perspective, but disagree that “something is better than nothing” when it comes to therapy. There are plenty of bad therapists, and self-help is sometimes either detrimental or not possible for everyone with certain conditions for various reasons. If you re-read the original post, you’ll see that people are talking specifically about having had therapy, and it not being effective. I’m glad that your abilities allow you to get effective help when you’re desperate, but I think it’s important for people to know that not everyone has that ability, and therapy has limitations and even down-sides. 

There’s a very pervasive culture these days of self-diagnosed “codependency” and confusion about “support vs enabling.” Too many abled people are being taught in therapy and self-help groups/forums to withdraw from relationships where people need support due to disability, under the false premise that someone who doesn’t get therapy for their challenges is being enabled. They are taught to go “no contact” because withdrawal of friend/family support allows the targeted person to reach “rock bottom” where they must seek out help. This is a false and dangerous example of when “therapy” is harmful, and actually becomes a form of abuse/neglect toward the most vulnerable. Not everyone can “think” their way out of their physical and mental health challenges by talking to someone or doing a workbook. Sometimes it’s not negative self-perspective that is the problem, but one of a lack of ability and adequate support. 

Narratives about the false idea that therapy is available or helpful in some form for everyone, puts the onus back on the compromised individual, when what we really need are societal solutions that make life easier for people with severely compromising disabilities, so that we can live with dignity and humanity."
My mom just admitted that she didn’t like traveling with me because she saw be as a burden. I’m heartbroken.,88,disability,"Here’s the core of the issue: your Mom is allowed to have feelings and be frustrated at the situation. What she should not do is make her feelings about the situation about you.

YOU did not choose cancer. YOU did not choose complications from chemo. YOU did not choose disability. YOU did not choose mental health disorders. The only choice you made was to get life-saving treatment, and when you get down to the core of it, your mother is so glad you are ALIVE. She is just tired and worn. And so are you.

Life-saving treatments can have unintended side effects. But when the choice is life or death, I can’t imagine your mother would have wanted you to choose differently than you did. Try to cling to that, and know that your mother was in a moment of weakness. She was tired, and she probably feels immensely guilty. If she could, I guarantee she would swap places with you. Take all the pain away so you could love a normal life. But she can’t. And I’m sure it’s painful to see her child suffer every day, and then layer the reality of the situation on top, and everyone’s going to crack under that pressure. 

Take some deep breaths. Hug your Mom. Tell each other you love each other. And then let the healing begin."
What happens to disabled adults who can’t afford the price of rent and can’t live with their parents?,85,disability,"The chances of getting a section 8 voucher as a single adult are rough. The waitlists where I'm at take years to get on. If you can try to get a social worker who can help you get an emergency section 8 voucher to avoid homelessness vs an abusive situation. This may be hard if you never pressed charges against your parents for abuse. Otherwise I'd say start preparing to be homeless.

If you can find even the most part time of part time jobs that you can do so you can get your car signed over to you that would be ideal so you can live out of your car. Ots much nicer than living on the street. 

You should qualify for medicaid since your on your own and have no income, although some states have a work requirement. Same with snap. 

Get your disability application in NOW. They can take years to get approved but once you do you get backpay to the date you filed. It took me over 2 years to qualify, with a lawyer, and I got 20k in backpay. I am hemipalegic, a wheelchair user, and have difficulty speaking and mental health issues severe enough to hospitalized me several times and I got denied and had to appeal twice. I couldnt even push my own wheelchair, dress or bathe myself, or communicate effectivly verbally and i still got denied. Make sure all your doctors are on board with you getting on disability or it likely won't happen. 

Work on finding resources now, like where the local homeless shelters are and how to navigate them. Once your on medicaid and if your disabled enough you could also move into a nursing home environment, but you have to be pretty sick to get into those. 

I'd honestly move back in with abusive parents and go back in the closet to avoid being homeless somewhere it gets cold, but that's just me. I can ignore a lot of shit. YMMV. If you get ssi while living woth your parents the amount will be reduced because you aren't paying rent but will go up to $900ish once you move out. 

You could also try and find a job as a live in nanny if you think you could handle taking care of some kids or as a caregiver to another disabled person. My mom has a room she ""rents"" for free just to have someone around to take care of the house amd cook meals amd her last caregiver was disabled just not as disabled as my mom.  

If you have a local center for independent living I'd check them out too. If your on medicaid and ssi there are some alternative housing arrangements for disabled younger people some places. Mostly for ID but you never know unless you ask. 

You may also want to look into your states vocational rehabilitation programs. We have a program here where you live on campus while you do vocational school and voc rehab can help you find a program like that if you think you can handle the training.
Hello sorry you are going through this. But I can tell you a story. I 20(F) on ssi live with my bf and his family. When I was in high school I left and went to a shelter it was ok for a while until I wa falsely accused of assault mind u I’m in Florida. I got out went to another shelter and then a program for mental health and substance abuse or rehab. I was still 18 at the time. My case worker got me approved for ssi(disability) October 2021 and started nov 2021. Mind you I couldn’t access payment or nothing I met my bf December 2021 and we started dating on his birthday December 8th 2021. So it was a lot of back and forth jumping place to place went to a shelter January to February 2022 and I left again. I been traveling all over my state. And then move with my bf and his family at the end of march and everything was fine but I’m still here but it’s not what I’m trying to do. I became my own payee at end of January 2023 and since I started my payment march 1st and it’s more stressful being my own payee but I’m managing I’m getting my back pay from  Nov 2021 all the way to February 2023. What I’m basically what I’m trying to say even though it’s hard out here I have a faith everything will work out in your favor. Talk with your doctor counselor case manager. Try to get low income housing and stuff like that. Try renting a room from someone in the mean time so u won’t be in the street and you have a roof over your head and so you can shower as well try to be able to get any type of government help like food and cash assistance if you’re able these will help a-lot and best of luck
Well, this is a tough one. I really wish that they had retirement style communities for younger people with disabilities.

I have POTS, hEDS Narcolepsy (shows up with those more frequently than in the general population).

I don't have much advice here, but I do on finding Drs and applying for disability.   I got it without having to appeal. 

I'm 47, and I don't think i could live on my own, and NOT with my family, and I need out of my marriage as it is a disaster and my spouse wont do counseling. 

I plan to call around to social services and see if I can get a case worker to help me find resources.  Sometimes they can help with remote jobs. 

My other thought for Me is to post a roommate ad looking to offer low rent in exchange for help, or another person on disability where we can compensate for each other. 

Sadly, you probably need to move to a new location.   I had to move from Seattle. 

I would call the SSA too, and find out if you qualify for SSI or SSDI.

You are young, but you might have enough credits for SSDI.

I would add to your list of hopes in a job for one that has disability insurance and buy it up, if you can.

If you aren't eligible for SSDI, trying to get enough credits, if you can push yourself enough to get them, is going to help you long term. I went on disability at 27.

If you lost your last job due to your disability, I would talk to an employment lawyer.   Did they offer a disability policy?  Maybe you can still qualify.

Here is info on finding a good Dr for hEDS & dysautonomia. If you live in NC, I can make recommendations.

I would also consider talking to a sleep specialit, if you are having any sleep problems. They can get masked or exacerbate or get mistaken for mental health, though i an NOT discounting your mental health.

If you (or anyone) wants to DM me, I have a bunch of stuff on applying for disabiliy and how to have your best chance of being approved right away.

I also have something on how to ask for accommodations properly...

In addition to a post on finding eds/pots drs that are GOOD.

On the PTSD/mental health, you might want to google Ketamine and depression or PTSD.  Its legit FDA approved, and seems to work well.

So, DM me if you want any of those three things.

You are in about my worst nightmare rn. Im so sorry! 🌷❤️"
"Is it ableist to refer to people with Down's syndrome as ""younger in the mind""/""mentally younger""?",88,disability,"Well apparently ADHD and Autism are both cases of being ""mentally younger"" which is about what could be expected from neurodevelopmental disorders... however mental age doesn't say much about anything. Mental age merely means that my abilities may be comparable with someone who is younger. It doesn't mean I am incapable of consent or other things related to children. I would only accept the concept under the clause that people understood kids are far smarter than they realise.

So I think these ideas would also port over to Down Syndrome as well in some ways. But only folks with it could really give a fully applicable answer, but I honestly am starting to believe that intelligence is a misunderstood concept in general. Someone with an intellectual disability is not someone who lacks intelligence but merely lacks the ability to make as efficient use of a tool of intelligence. Intelligence is relative to the subject in question and intelligence is an unmeasurable statistic. We can only measure intelligence in regards to subject matter, such as core skills like English, Literacy, Maths, Science, etc.

Perhaps core skills are more useful generally, but I doubt that my inability to do maths in a timely manner means I am incapable of maths, merely my clock time efficiency is lower than it should be because of less working memory as a result of ADHD.

A really good example of the flawed concept of intelligence and mental age... I bet the average 8th grader is more proficient in general or complex mathematics than the average 30 years old. Obviously this doesn't account for the average 30 year old who works in a field which requires complex mathematics... It just comes down to the good old fashioned... ""this maths wont help us in the real world"". The human brain is a sponge, not a hard drive. Sponges dry out eventually without constant practice. This is why elderly people are typically seen as less intelligent... It's literally because they have been retired for 10-30 years. lol

So mental age is merely a comparison metric, otherwise we would be saying certain ethnicities are mentally children compared to their peers. And I merely point it out because the link between Ableism and Racism is pretty solid. What else would all of the bullshit about race and IQ be about?

Perhaps poverty and lack of access to early interventions or supports increases the risk of being ""less intelligent"". At least that's the conclusion made when public education was found to be a huge success for development of core skills. Perhaps many disabled people just haven't been properly included in that system? 🤔

Does this mean the person who cut you off in traffic isn't less intelligent or childish? CORRECT! That's a result of workplace stress! WHICH is a separate topic I will spare others for now. My biggest problem is seeing that intersectionality has literally no borders and stretches into all fields! :P"
RANT (no advice please) applying for disability is soul crushing,88,disability,"I don't know what country you're in, but I could have written this myself. I'm in the US. Just 2 days ago I got denied for a second time. I have autism spectrum disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder.   
  
I had to quit working 5 years ago due to autistic burnout and I didn't even know I was autistic until last year. I had already been going to therapy for 5 years before that. Therapy was a joke, and still is, but I've been forcing myself to go because otherwise I would not get approved. The guy who diagnosed me said that I could probably handle work if I would get on medication. I am against medication for a couple of reasons which I don't need to go into, because the entire point here is that the system is so messed up that the only acceptable way that they will support our need to survive is if we alter our brain chemistry and risk getting side effects. And even then, we are just putting a Band-Aid over a gaping wound and going on like there's nothing wrong. They will not look at the core cause of mental health issues, which are made worse by the system itself.  
  
I also want to agree with the whole entire process in general.  I needed to have my ARMHS worker help me with the paperwork and calling the lawyer and everything else. I can barely make decisions, phone calls, or carry out daily tasks sometimes. And they expect us to be capable of organizing a lifetime's worth of information and paperwork, especially when paperwork is nearly impossible with people with mental health issues. It is mentally draining for anyone to think. It is even more mentally draining for someone with mental health issues to think. It's also mentally draining for someone with mental health issues to do tasks even with somebody helping them. Like you said, we struggle to gather the medical evidence because of our disability. And the way the system is set up, there's nothing we can do about it.  
  
My next step is to schedule a hearing with a judge and this involves way more effort than I've already put in so far, so I'm debating whether or not I even have it in me to keep fighting.  
  
I wish that our world was different and the people in charge actually cared about people with mental illnesses. Everyone deserves safe housing and healthy food regardless of whether or not we are capable of working."
Bullied by a stranger for being disabled ,86,disability,"I know it's difficult in the moment especially the first time it happens. People like that, there is as much wrong with them as the rest of us. Mental health system fails people as much as physical disabilities health system ultimately fails people. 

Doesn't make it right, you can be disabled and still be an asshole. They are not mutually exclusive. 

In cases like that, I just try to get away from them. Don't leave it for someone else to be put in a position of ""wanting to go look for some and come back in legal trouble of their own"". Because that doesn't help you, and it really doesn't help whoever goes out looking. 

Best safety tips are ones that apply regardless if you are disabled or not. Simply because they are the most basic things people can do. If you have to, go into a store or building, avoid confrontation. Go towards a crowd, safety in numbers. Make a statement about are you going to calling the police or asking others to do this, as long as they are not the ""Karen"" types they generally will go away fairly fast. If they won't leave you alone. That is absolutely when you call for emergency services, ideally with much distance as possible.
Happens to me a lot… especially towards my mental health and psychiatric disabilities. I’m in an urban area but that two faced social butterfly leaked my whole history and list of conditions and disabilities after I called her out and left. Now everyone knows everything :(

I can’t go anywhere without getting stared at, glared at, harassed, stereotyped, yelled at, etc. Especially about my disabilities. Worst part: everyone loves her! You only see the real her when you’ve lived with her for a month. The she slowly lets her real self slip out."
Mental health as a disability and how to not feel bad about it.,85,disability,"I have my disability hearing early February and all my disabilities are mental health too. Same as yours with OCD thrown in too. I sometimes struggle with the validation of it all but then I go read my journals from when I was working and see what a dangerous place I was in and I feel more valid and like I’m doing the right thing. I’m 33 and filed in September of 2019 so I’m excited to have my hearing soon but also terrified of being denied. I will still consider myself disabled if I get denied though because I know myself (I think) and hopefully this will help me keep boundaries for myself so I’ll help myself not go too far.
I'm physically disabled and have C-PTSD. Mental health disabilities are totally valid.  The C-PTSD often disables me more than my physical disabilities.
I have been on disability for my mental heath issues since I was 21. Its hard having an invisible disability and i do get judged a lot but regardless of a govt stamp, you are valid. i wish the world wasnt so fucking hell bent on demonizing all things mental health still. i struggle with identity a lot, tbh and its hard to “look like everyone else” and not FEEL or be able to FUNCTION like “everyone else” around it all. But its valid, and deserving of support like any other disability.
If you want to talk you can talk to me too! I have all the same diagnoses as you, plus some physical ones. Im 26 and have been on disability since I turned 18, but I got on it for mental health, not my physical disabilities. I feel like we have a lot in common, I dont do anything social except talk to my roommate when she is home and until the last week, I havent left the apartment since November except for some doctor appointments. Ive been hospitalized a lot for being suicidal and I know it's hard to make the decision to get help. Im glad you did. <3"
Top comment... Bruh... On a post about a kid with an extreme case of Neurofibromatosis,83,disability,"I’ve seen many people who wholeheartedly suffer from Neurodevelopmental Disorders like autism. I’ve also seen people who wholeheartedly suffer due to mental health disorders like OCD, anxiety, depression. I believe there is standard for such things as “suffering.” If that makes sense."
Finally got the courage to use the scooters at the store and get so many dirty looks..,87,disability,"Lots of us when first starting on a disability journey, truly believe that everyone is staring at us and being disapproving when using aids to help us such as wheelchairs canes, rollators etc.

That being said we all have to have a pretty thick skin . 

Is there anything you can do about this type of behavior from others? Yes and no, you need to consider the fact that because they’re not disabled, they don’t get it and just move on. I think the first couple years I was disabled was the hardest.
  However, spending more than a few minutes w
 worrying about these IGNORANT CLODS should never be done. What these people think truly isn’t important however,  what you do with your time is the most important thing.

Sure you’re gonna have stares & you’re gonna have people make stupid comment but the best thing you can do is just go about your business. You could say “ Have the day you deserve “ and continue on your way. don’t give them the opportunity to get engaged with their daily bullshit. being constantly worried about what people think isn’t really good for your mental health. Please ignore them. I know it’s hard but you have to try.
   

It’s not worth it for your mental health.
I can relate, OP, as a white cane user who isn’t totally blind and thus gets judged and stared at all the time. Hell, even if I was totally blind, I would likely still constantly get stared at / talked about just for virtue of being different.

This is the unfortunate reality of using mobility devices. People are going to stare and make awful or unnecessary comments. It really fucking sucks that a requirement in order for us to function outside is to have to FULLY be in idgaf mode all the time and constantly force ourselves to ignore people’s very plain and obvious judgement.

Like we have to do the extra mental health work in order to be in that headspace of “I don’t give a shit about what other people think of me right now”. I’m still trying to work my way up to it. :( I know it’s possible, I know one day I can feel more comfortable outside, but fuck it’s taking a while to get there."
"I'm so isolated, and after a decade of handling it well, I'm a wreck, crying all the time. The immense loneliness hurts.",82,disability,"What about SSI and SSDI? I think you can get both in the US. I’m so sorry that you’re going through this.
Being lonely is awful. I wish I could give you the biggest hug right now. Is there any way at all that you’d be able to come back to the US and find housing; even section 8 or something? I know there are programs for disabled people, including food stamps and Medicaid. Also this sound stupid but I’m praying for you, for your safety and for your health and mental health and to find good, trustworthy friends. Im sending you the biggest hugs"
Disability hearing tomorrow. Please wish me luck!,83,disability,My advice would be to temper your expectations. I was openly scoffed at by the judge overseeing my hearing (and this was after my social security advocate told me that this judge was empathetic towards mental health cases). I wish you well.
