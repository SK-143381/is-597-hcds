"Apparently, finding interpreters is impossible.",88,deaf,"This is absolutely unacceptable.  I am an interpreter, and I have worked in mental health settings in a supervisory capacity (not as an interpreter).  About 30% of our residents were deaf.  There was an interpreter at EVERY junction of the residents’ mental health therapy and care, AND the faculty and staff (including me, a supervisor) could sign.  A facility like the one I worked at is not the norm, but it certainly exists. Where are you in the states? Also, look into remote interpreting if there are genuinely no interpreters in your area (unlikely, and not optimal, I know).   Yeah, technically a private facility can just say no.  But there are private places that will be accommodating, as well as publicly run options.
I'm truly sorry about what you're going through. It's bullshit. 

My wife is a deaf therapist, and we live in a deaf mecca (Rochester, NY) and she's very frustrated with the mental health system here. There is a serious lack of residential treatment facilities that can accommodate deaf patients. It's even worse for difficult patients, because they typically get kicked out of RTF's due to serious behavioral issues. And that basically means they have absolutely nowhere left to go.

If it's that bad here, then it's likely much worse everywhere else. Hearing people basically don't give a damn when it comes to mental health services for the deaf, and deaf therapists have difficulty trying to push this issue through the hearing-centric system. 

Funding for deaf mental health services also is a joke. Everything is run on shoestring budget."
I hate being deaf,82,deaf,The DMV? I would not have guessed that would be a deaf friendly workplace..
rant about this community,62,deaf,"I'm so sorry you received so much negative energy.  I missed your first post, so I'm not up to speed. 

It sounds like you need immediate help in the workplace.  A CI isn't going to be immediate help.  But CART can be!!!

I had a similar experience in college and I dropped out because of it.  Years later, I decided to take a chance and the school disability office introduced me to CART. It changed my life.  I honestly never world have made it through college (let alone been on the Dean's list or getting a graduate degree)  if it hasn't been for this.

 CART is basically someone typing out every single word that is being said during trainings. And the best part is that you don't have to worry about taking notes! The whole transcript is emailed to you afterwards.  This allows you to focus solely on listening instead of taking notes but if you miss hearing a word, you just look at the computer screen, and you are all caught up.  Your brain can focus on what it is leaning rather than focus on understanding words.  

This is considered a reasonable accommodation under the ADA in America.  Your company's cannot argue about trade secrets or anything to refuse providing this. 

This may be something you use your whole life or out may be something to help bridge the gap between now and when you have adapted to your CI (which can take months and exhausts you).

Now that being said.  I had my CI surgery on my 30s. I love it but there are still some downsides.  Group conversations and nose encircled are easier but it's not perfect.  In many ways, you'll still rely on old habits because they are so ingrained.   Getting my CI did make me more comfortable and accepting of being deaf. It helped me advocate for myself, and it made coworkers really understand just how deaf I am.  I became more confident in demanding others do their share of the communication burden.   That may or may not be what happens for you.  I still use oral speech as my primary communication tool.  A CI is a tool to help you reach your goals. Nobody can tell you what your communicating goals are and who you have to be.
* Are you able to get a CART service at your college if you are still in college? The CART service made a huge difference on my end. I always had ASL interpreters in my college classes, but it did not help me because I had to focus on the interpreters. I didn't have time to translate from ASL to English. So, I couldn't write down any notes at all. The CART service exceeded my note taking needs. 
* Please let your professor know the benefits of wearing a microphone / transmitter. Hopefully, he will change his mind. 
* As for the internship, were you able to get your retraining at this time with your accommodation needs being fulfilled? How long are you staying at this internship? Are you getting paid at this internship? 
   * If yes, you are entitled to reasonable accommodations at internships and jobs in order to thrive in this workplace. There is no way for employers to decline your reasonable accommodations. Please don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. 
      * Please make a list of your reasonable accommodations in a professional manner and email the HR department (copy this email to your personal email address too). Work email addresses can be deleted permanently. So, you could have enough paper trails for future lawsuits, in case they turn down your reasonable accommodations. 
* Getting CIs is up to you. It's all about you. It's your decision. It will be part of your life permanently. You just need to ensure that you will not have any regrets in the end. I'm Deaf and ineligible for getting CIs. I have a couple of friends who have CIs. They say both good and bad things about having the CIs. 
   * Cons 
      * CIs giving static background (They can be corrected by your audiologist specialized in CIs) 
      * Hearing fatigue (You can just release your transmitter from your head whenever you take a break) 
      * CIs failed, they were not functioning at all (You can just see your audiologist to fix this issue. If your audiologist recommends removing CIs, you would spend money again for the surgery) 
      * Insurance might not cover the CI costs (Keep looking for different insurances until you find one) 
   * Pros
      * Able to hear sounds that you never heard when you wore hearing aids
      * Able to listen to music if you are a big fan of music (connect via bluetooth)
      * Able to swim with CIs (Hearing aids don't work in water if it stays submerged too long)
      * Able to hear your voice better when you speak. Adjust your voice.

When you turn off your CIs, you are still deaf, right? I treat CIs as one of the most effective communication tools for people with hearing loss. 

I wish all the best to you!"
Mental Health Issues In Deaf Community,63,deaf,"I don't remember where I saw this so I can't cite it.  While researching for something I came across a study where it basically said that Deaf Community population is very similiar to other disadvantaged minorities in term of statistics regarding mental health issues, drug issues, domestic violence, unemployment rates, education rates, and so on

It's a result of oppression the community experiences just like hearing minorities.
Wow, you pretty much summed up how I felt back in HS and early years of college. As I got older, I began to realize that CI doesn't really help me as much as I expected (Idk if that makes sense?). 

When it comes to group conversation, I will guarantee to be left out because I just cannot keep up with the conversation and constantly looking at different person's faces. It really sucks and people have made fun of me for not keeping up or looking stupid when I have no clue what they're talking about. It had a big negative impact to my sense of self-worth. I just feel useless and feel like shit waking up every day knowing that I would probably get made fun of or people ignoring/give up after I keep saying ""what"". I don't know, maybe I am just soft or I just get emotional very easily lol. 

Now, I have been practicing ASL and I am currently doing ASL TA thing for a class. I honestly did feel a little better in terms of self-esteem when communicating with deaf people using ASL. I didn't keep saying ""what"" over and over again, didn't make fun of, and I did feel a little bit useful when I can contribute to a conversation. I don't mean to advertise ASL, I just find it somewhat helpful to me regarding my personal self-esteem imo (I don't feel useless every day).

Sorry for the long rant. I just really liked this topic and wished they can be more open-minded and take mental health seriously (in general) especially to the Deaf community (not saying Deaf community is perfect, they have some flaws as well).

I work in the mental health industry and made a post about the poor treatment of our Deaf clients at my agency a few weeks ago
[Disappointment at Work](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/9mybnm/disappointment_at_work/)

I'm happy to say that my complaining to HR had some success, and while it's still being debated, my HR rep has demanded better consideration for our Deaf clients from both the company director and our ethics director!  I hope to continue to see advancement! 
I definitely know my mental health issues are because of hearies and dysconcious audists."
Relationship advice: deaf husband/hearing wife wanting more efficient communication,57,deaf,"I’m deaf, my husband is hearing. I’m glad you’re being proactive learning ASL. The largest struggle for me was having to adapt all my life in a hearing world. My parents were told not to teach me ASL because I wouldn’t be successful. Well this led to years of isolation. Family gatherings I play on my phone as well because people tend to get awkward when I ask them to repeat themselves. They also like to tease I responded incorrectly from mishearing info or I am just plain exhausted trying to keep up in groups or background noise. I’m fine playing on my phone, I find it relaxing, I also need it to decompress. For some reason there’s always someone that finds it rude but hey, my mental health and being is more important than a little social gathering. 
Learning ASL after so long feels so unnatural, it’s difficult. Using ASL, the sentence structure is different form verbal so I find that challenging as well. It’s also discouraging going in person. It ends up feeling like an all day event just to learn a bit of ASL. However, when I took ASL online, at my own pace. I enjoyed learning. Gallaudet offers free courses online. See if he will start there. Then I highly recommend taking the the ASL and Deaf Studies certification. Again, the online and convenience of it I think will help.
Edit: some typos"
What can I do to encourage my hospital to purchase medical masks with the see-through option for lip reading?,58,deaf,"TIL those masks exist. We wear masks, gloves, AND face shields all day at work, but luckily my coworkers have picked up on the fact that using gestures quadruples the rate at which I process wtf they said. Unfortunately my hearing aids struggle in the busier parts of the day because the animals I work with are very VERY loud at times. Normally lip reading fills in the gaps for me when it comes to similar sounding words.

I'm not sure I would want to ask my employer to switch to those if they are much more expensive, considering I'm getting along fine (maybe with a few repetitions), although it might be nice to have a box in my locker just in case. But you should definitely push, you have a right to be able to hear your doctors, and it's ridiculous to try to do any mental health test if the person can't fully hear you!
I can’t recall if I ever had a sign on my door that I was deaf—I remember asking for one when I was on the medical unit during one of my mental health crises because I was so angry about the cognition test being inaccessible. I will ask my PCP if that’s possible. Unfortunately they don’t use color coded bracelets, but that would help. Especially if it can flag the system to remind people to seek me out in waiting rooms.

I ran into the issue of not knowing when it was my turn...at the SSD office, and nearly missing out."
Advice needed - is being exhausted from listening normal?,50,deaf,"It really is. A lot of people don’t realize how much work it takes just to seem “normal” in the hearing world without an interpreter or communication accessibility.

This situation happens nearly every time I go out: Hearing person starts talking, I quickly interrupt and let them know that I’m deaf and can read their lips. They either start yelling at me because they think louder means comprehension (when it just messes up lip movement and makes it even harder to read them), or they give me a pity party: “I’m so sorry…”

I deal with it by basically staying within my circle of family and friends that I can communicate with via sign. I’ve turned down a lot of invites to go clubbing, parties, any social event if there will be more than two or three hearing people due to how exhausting it gets to follow the conversation.

You’ll just stress yourself out if you keep dwelling on how it makes you feel. Find an outlet that allows you to feel included and involved, not as easy to do as it is to type that, but that’s a method that’s helped me a lot.

I’ve been Deaf for 40 years now, and I’m still finding stuff out on how to deal with situations or people and how it affects my mental health. If it’s causing you that much emotional turmoil, then I would recommend going to a therapist/counselor to vent to so you aren’t carrying that burden around all the time."
It’s been rough & school makes it worse. Mentally drained.,51,deaf,"I feel like you just described my life haha

I really relate to a lot of what you said. I'm 21 years old, just about to finish college, and I can't help but wonder how different my college life would've been if I could hear normally, both socially and academically. I've also had my fair share of times when I've felt like crying in public, because I can't hear anything that's going on around me. I think I know what you mean when you say you feel like you're in denial almost. For the longest time, and a little bit still today, I've pretended that my deafness wasn't a big deal and that I could hear fine enough, because I couldn't stand the thought that I was deaf and that I needed help. This internal struggle hurt my mental health, and I'm finding out that I have to accept the fact that deafness is a part of who I am, and that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. It's okay to ask for help when you need it, and you should ask for help so that you can be on the same playing field as everyone else. 

I would definitely encourage you to learn about deaf culture and ASL. I took a few classes in high school and it was amazing how relaxing it is to not have to strain to hear things. I found out that my college has foreign language tables where you can practice different languages, and recently they started an ASL table, so I've been trying to relearn ASL so that I can join in. 

I wish you all the best!"
How do you find a mental health therapist?,41,deaf,"If you're near Queens, NY, you should call the Lexington Center. They have mental health specialists that serve the Deaf community. Good luck to you both!
HEY!

https://www.nj.gov/humanservices/ddhh/

This is the NJ website for deaf/hoh. If you scroll down there is a line for mental health. 


Even if that's not perfect, they can point you to good services."
"Are Deaf people supposed to just... not have mental health issues? (half vent, half ""please help me"")",39,deaf,"Yeah, see, THAT to me, is the greater problem. You NEED a GREAT internet connection. Is there any way to access better Internet? 
 It would be impossible for me to survive without the internet. With the internet, it doesn't matter if I'm Deaf, and it doesn't matter if the other party is hearing and speaks. Google Live Captioning is a GAME CHANGER and has transformed my life. I cannot tell you enough how wonderful it's been for me, also a long time consumer of mental health services. Through Google Love Captioning I'm able to participate in tele-health AND Group therapy as well as a hearing prison, and better than I could IRL and F2F, this includes twelve step groups, as well."
Disappointment at Work,35,deaf,"They don't get to decide that though. I'm all for calling out folks being too easily offended but even logically this is a service provider. They're not supposed to be going out of their way to try and offend people, they should be trying to make people comfortable there as a business (even if it weren't the right thing to do and doubly so for a mental health place!). Those same people can vote with their feet, it's just good business sense to not be actively trying to piss them off. They don't even have to understand the why if their minds aren't capable, they were told not to use the term unless the individual uses it to refer to themselves so they should just listen. People irritate me man. *grammar or attempts at such"
Masks are back indoors everywhere in California again,33,deaf,"I do too, but I moved to San Diego because the rain in Portland made me depressed and suicidal for half the year. My family is in Georgia, but being a gay man I absolutely refuse to live in the south again. There are other options that are sunny, but they don’t have the beach. Legally you are allowed to pull your mask down to communicate with a HOH or deaf person, but it just isn’t happening at my workplace, at least for me, I’m not sure about customers as I generally work the bar. You’re right this is a very divided issue and I’m not really advocating for no masks anywhere. I just can’t stomach the idea of working for $20 an hour or less. Fortunately there is an end date to this, as someone told me in this thread. So that is a very big relief."
Do mental hospitals allow hearing aids/BAHAs,25,deaf,"I did a bout of inpatient in high school, and I still wore hearing aids at that age. I can confirm that they WILL let you keep them. It's medically necessary both for your physical AND mental health. Taking it from you would only add more anguish to the situation, which would not even be conducive to helping you in a critical moment like this."
is it possible to not admit or struggle with deaf identity?,20,deaf,"It's called different things because it manifests in different ways, but basically yes - it can be hard to feel like you identify with a group that you've had so little contact with.  You've been mostly muddling by through making yourself fit in with your hearing peers because that was your source of social interaction etc.  Now that you're getting older that's not quite working and your social worker's noticed something in your interactions. 

Honestly it's not a bad thing to go talk to a psychiatrist or counselor.  Mental health is important and it looks so different for different people.  It's not like they're going to immediately say you need medication or you're weird, or you're going to get thrown into 24/7 mental unit or whatever.  It's just to help you sort things out in a safe, educated way.
It's hard to admit to oneself that you have a disability. At most, you want to look at it as an inconvenience or annoyance that you can just cope with. Because, for it to be a real thing, feels like an admission of weakness.

And also, a lot of people just don't know what to do about their deafness. They just think they're broken. And it's easy to get stuck in that rut.

Sometimes you need someone else to help you see past the immediate problems and find whatever the right path forward is. Deafness can be a big barrier, and a lot of people need help knowing what to do next.

So, definitely recommend therapy for anyone who struggles (hearing related or not). A mental health pro can be the level-headed person that helps you get through your emotions to get through whatever's blocking you from living your life."
Does anybody know how I can find a therapist that I can communicate with?,20,deaf,"Definitely talk to your deaf services agency.  In my state,  we have a particular mental health group that is contracted for all Deaf mental health services in the state.  But you may not see that of you just search for asl therapists.  

If you go the VRI route,  you'll need to ask about licensing in your state and if insurance will cover it."
hard of hearing LMHC in training,20,deaf,"The masks are such a struggle. Have you looked into any of the clear masks? My workplace recently ordered some for me! We just started back in person (we were previously virtual, which came with its own challenges) and it has been tough. I’m planning to give each of my clients clear masks to wear while I am working with them."
Have a hard time learning sign due to my other mental disabilities,18,deaf,"You got this! Honestly I was the same way. I used to be at the top of my class and then my mental health took a sharp decline and I was never the same again. I'm still grateful I can learn though, it just takes longer than other people sometimes"
What do you want the hearing community to understand?,16,deaf,"I wish I knew more about the intent behind the slideshow, but have you considered having your friend make the presentation for you?  Maybe it's a school requirement and you can't, but it seems like the information would be better actually coming from a Deaf individual than someone trying to speak on behalf of the community.  I don't doubt your intentions, but I don't know the extent of your knowledge and understanding.  Presenting yourself like an expert is something to be wary of.

That said, I would suggest adding a section on best practice for communicating through an interpreter, especially in situations where the information being exchanged is sensitive in nature.  It might seem obvious but you'd be surprised how many people will only look at an interpreter and not the Deaf individual, or who will speak directly *to* the interpreter rather than the actual client.  In situations where concerns about confidentiality and really heavy or emotional topics are a consideration, it's important that the interpreter not be walking in totally blind, or that the health professional not assume that they are in a position to make decisions on the behalf of the client.  Things like that.

It's very important that people recognize that Deaf culture **is** exactly that... a culture with values, ideas, and behaviors that differ from hearing culture.  That's especially critical to realize when a health professional might be drawing conclusions about a person's state of wellbeing from the way that they present themselves or behave.  Honestly, it's a huge subject to try to broach.  Not a simple or straightforward undertaking at all.

[Neil Glickman](http://www.neilglickman.com/) is kind of *""the name""* in Deaf mental healthcare.  I'd suggest reading as much of his stuff as you can."
How do I deal with loosing my hearing?,11,deaf,"Hey op the other comment left here is super negative and I’m sorry that person feels that way but it is not the outlook that you also have to have if you don’t want to. Totally normal and okay to have a lot of big and negative emotions about your hearing but it doesn’t have to be so black and white like the other comment made it seem. I’m not going to say suddenly losing your hearing at a young age is easy. I suddenly lost a good chunk in one ear when I was 8 and it has progressed slowly until that ear has lost all hearing, im now 22. There are things that I face due to my deafness sometimes that will make me sad but over time those have become less as I’ve learned about how to accomodate and the things I can’t do anything about I’m getting better at just accepting. Because not everyone can do everything, we all have limitations that we have to accept. And having a good support system is helpful because a good support system is the type to learn sign language with you or find other ways to still communicate with you as you lose hearing, they don’t allow you to just get completely left out. Having a good support system means having people that may not understand but that you can vent to, and connecting to your local deaf community can give you both of those things. Having a good support system means having one that believes you when you say you didn’t hear them and makes adjustments to help you. I think it may be easy for some to say that a good support system does nothing because they’ve never had a bad one and don’t know how much that would have worsened their situation. It’s more common than not for families to not even attempt to learn sign language for their deaf family member. It’s also super common for deaf kids to have been told they were faking and not received any accommodation as a result. People who have healthy support systems are lucky even if they don’t realize it. Eta: obviously based on what you shared you are experiencing both. Your parents aren’t being the best support system currently and are adding to your feelings. Have you tried talking to them directly about it though? Maybe things are being misinterpreted or maybe they need to be talked to to even understand the struggles that come with losing your hearing. And you also have your good support system that’s there for you but you struggle to depend on. Also normal. The more you can accommodate yourself the better it often is for your mental health and it’s also good to remind yourself that everyone needs help with things sometimes. 

I’m not going to pretend being deaf isn’t a disability though. It does disable you from interacting with the world without at least some accommodation. That does make life hard. I’m not downplaying that. I’m just saying that it doesn’t have to be the end of your life being happy or good. Life can still be beautiful and happy without your hearing. It’s of course a big adjustment and doesn’t feel fair and it’s normal for it to be a lot to process but it’s possible to make the adjustment and live a good life. It’s normal to have anxiety or even panic at the loss of a sense and it’s possible to work through the emotions and find comfort in your other senses.
I'm 57.  I've been HoH since I was 7 years old and wearing hearing aids.  I'm profoundly deaf now as speech comprehension is greatly diminished and retired.  

First of all, don't beat yourself up.  It's not your fault.  You aren't a liability.  

I can relate to your anxiety of losing your hearing.  It's frightening and you feel very alone.  
Believe me, things will get better.  A lot better.  It helps to have local support and I would  
encourage you to attempt to make friends with others who are HoH / deaf.  

If you have an iPhone, I use Group Transcribe that turns speech to text.  It's quite useful  
in noisy environments where hearing aids are pretty much useless.  It's very good at  
picking up conversations.

Also keep your mental health in check.  Depression will over-take you if you wallow in  
your despair.  I had to start taking anti-depressants once I went profoundly deaf and  
had to quit my career that I loved.  It's important to keep those dark thoughts away.  
Don't give up.  

My hearing aids are bluetooth and I can stream all phone calls and music directly into  
my hearing aid.  This alone has been a life saver for me.  Also, if you want to feel the   
music -- look into SkullCandy's Crusher EVO headset.  It has haptics so there's no   
damage to your ears, but the bass will rattle your skull and you'll love it.  

Yeah, it sucks, but you'll be fine.  Lots of people out there with some type of disability,  
so you're not alone.  The advancements in finding a cure for deafness is improving, so  
keep your fingers crossed.

Stay strong.
are you able to wear the headphones over your hearing aids??? the haptics alone sound interesting so i definitely would love to give them a try.

I agree with keeping your mental health in check.. for years I could get by normally with my limited hearing until the day came where i couldn't. When you realize you can't go about your life the same as you once did, it's a hard adjustment.

**OP, keep your head up and make peace with this new normal. Lean on this community and know that you're not alone.** I'm sorry about your parents, just chuck it up to ignorance. They can't comprehend your experience without having lived it. Just focus on looking forward. It takes time for your brain to adjust to all the sound coming from your hearing aid, but if you feel that some things are too loud that's definitely worth talking to your audiologist about, they can adjust everything to a reasonable level. Once you start feeling comfortable with your hearing aids, concerts shouldn't be an issue although I'd think about getting some hearing protection of some kind (i read eargasm is a good brand for that)."
Putting all the pieces together and getting it off my chest,10,deaf,"Have you spoken to a mental health professional about your troubles hearing? I'm a hearing person working with a research group who look at what it's like being DHH in a hearing world from a psychological perspective, and I have learned a lot about how hearing loss effects mental well-being, though I am by absolutely no means an expert.

For example, you may experience more social anxiety symptoms, like say, after situations where people laugh after you say something that you thought was the appropriate response because you misheard the question, or more mental fatigue from having to cognitively 'work' harder to make up for the information that is missing about your environment.

It's something that I think you should think about, and don't leave it too long before you get your hearing assessed - at least then you can take charge of it and figure out what's going to be the best for you going forward. 

Btw, it sounds like you have an amazing support network at home, that's awesome :)
Thanks. I'll bookmark this and definitely look into it some more. Like I said, I know I'll get it taken care of, I just have a lot of obstacles. 

I also have PTSD so certain sounds (especially if they're sudden or I'm uncertain of where they're coming from) really weigh on my anxiety. When I get back to my mental health clinic I'll mention it to the doctor and see what advice they have going further. I have no doubt that the hearing loss plays a part in my mental health in some ways. I hope I didn't come off as if I don't think it's important. 
Thank you so much! This is kind of where I'm at. I recognize that my fears aren't necessarily ""real"" and I'm slowly but surely building my way up to dealing with the problem in my own way. A huge factor in my OCD is anxiety so it sounds like you get where I'm coming from, I really appreciate that. I think in posting here I was hoping someone had a similar experience? I wonder if any of my mental health issues would be alleviated any if I addressed my hearing issues now. Obviously not all of them but could help with the anxiety stuff! "
Husband going deaf,9,deaf,"ASL classes are definitely a good move, not only will he learn a new way to communicate but he will also meet fellow deaf/HoH people. One thing that tends to worsen mental health in late-deafened people is isolation, so getting out of the house and interacting with people on a regular basis can make a difference.
I started losing my hearing in high school and I am now 35 with severe hearing loss in my right ear and profound hearing loss in my left ear, coming to terms with having to live life without one of your senses is a big adjustement but it's nothing that can't be overcome with patience and support, and as it seems your husband is lucky enough to have a supportive spouse.
As far as other resources are concerned, I would recommend downloading LiveTranscribe apps and maybe Lingvano (which is Duolingo but for ASL) in order to start with signing before he starts studying the language in depth during his classes.

Good luck to both of you."
Question about mental health support for the deaf community,11,deaf,signed by stories on youtube has videos of deaf people sharing their mental health experiences. would recommend checking it out to gain some perspective
Mental health counseling student looking to improve counseling services for Deaf/ HOH Clients,9,deaf,"My experience is rather limited, as I intended to start therapy again right before pandemic hit, and my experience are from the times I was severely depressed, so it didn't really cover a lot of my life.

But... what I can say is that I have noticed that not only professionals aren't aware (or understand) the Deaf cultura, they also aren't aware of how much society can be ableist and how that can compound with other mental health issues and identities, as well, not understanding how capitalism is extremely oppressive and problematic for disabled people (not only deaf/Deaf/HoH), or even how society can teach us a lot of subtle messages in ways that a non disabled person doesn't even realize. And of course, they tend to not be aware of any disability history.

Many professionals are like ""oh yeah, but that doesn't really have any relation to..."", being extremely dismissive, as if we can just turn off our disability in our daily life and not be affected by it or as if our disability is just a minor detail that can't be connected to everything or anything at all.

I remember when I started looking for psychologist, one of my criteria was understanding how my HoH identity can tangle with other identities (such as being queer and non binary, as well asexual) and struggles and possible mental health diagnosis. For example, I have a couple of suspicions that I might be on the spectrum, however, when doing some tests, a lot of it feels familiar, but I don't know if those experience and feelings can be 100% due to my hearing loss (and all the consequences plus a lot of how society treat me) or if it's a mixed bag and so on. (Not sure if that made sense, let me know and I'll try to find a better way to explain, as English isn't my native language).

And to be honest, I didn't get far with that criteria. It's easy to find professionals that can understand how racism is deeply tangled with other stuff or even how LGBT+ identities can be tangled with other stuff, but it's extremely rare to find someone with minimal knowledge of not only the culture, but as well the disability history, and all the subtleties of the disabled/Deaf/deaf/HoH identity.

Recently, at an event, I ran into a friend's sister who is a psychologist, and one word lead to another, I mentioned that I have never felt as the main character of my own story, due to how I grew up, lack of representation, lack of understanding, as well how society teaches us that we aren't worth of affection, love, but instead, disaffection, disgust and so on, and the face of realization she had was a massive one, and even said something along the lines of ""That is so mind-blowing, I'm surprised that in no moment of my education or even afterwards, I never once stopped to think that treating patients that are disabled or Deaf/deaf/HoH is as complex as treating that are Black, queer/LGBT+, women and so on."" She wasn't aware of how deep the issues can run in the disabled community.
I'd suggest polling around NTID if you can, the mental health resources at the university sucked in more ways than one so you may get some good answers there.
Ugh that's unfortunate to read. I would have expected NTID to have mental health resources specifically geared towards supporting their students. Thank you for the comment, and suggestion I will definitely check it out!
It's more that the mental health resources suck campus wide, not just for NTID. Lot of mediocre to bad counselors from the experience of my group."
