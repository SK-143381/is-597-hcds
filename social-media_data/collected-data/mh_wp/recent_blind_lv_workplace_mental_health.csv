AITA for trying to pursue a relationship with a guy while he’s getting over his ex?,21,AITAH,"his whole “not putting a label on it” thing is soooooooo lame and immature to me. the man moved himself into your apartment and told you he was in love with you: how was a “label” fundamentally going to change anything about how fast HE was moving in the relationship? or about how much he was “committing” to you? 

and yes, this definitely seems like love bombing. and extremely manipulative too. when you first started talking he immediately wanted to know about your problems and love style (after already thoroughly stalking your socials)? he was literally searching for the ammo he was gonna use to love bomb you! when he understands your problems and love style, he can figure out exactly which buttons to push to get whatever reactions he wants. 

the fact he heard a male laugh in the back of your phone call and had such an extremely emotional outburst is also quite concerning to me and screams insecurity. he clearly doesn’t really trust you or have that much faith in your relationship. it literally just feels like a child throwing a tantrum. creating a victim scenario also allows him to better manipulate you by making you feel bad, and also feel insecure about your standing with him. he is quite literally projecting his own insecurity onto you. it’s fair to be considerate of his mental health issues (as you clearly are) but it is NOT your responsibility to fix this man and put yourself through the emotional labour of being in a relationship with someone who clearly needs to heal before they can actually be a good, secure partner to you. 

also, the fact he was making all these “commitments” is just another way to love bomb by making you feel like there is a “bigger picture” to your relationship and you should ignore all of the little red flags. it makes you feel like you can let your guard down because you are trying to invest in a future, but this just lets him in to manipulate even more. 

and, fr, the final straw is him telling YOU that YOU need to be the one doing work on yourself…. talk about the pot calling the kettle black. he is just trying to shift responsibility for this whole situation onto you and make you feel like you’re crazy 

honestly, staying “friends” with him just seems like another way to maintain an emotional connection without any commitment. if you truly think you can revert to seeing him only platonically, that’s a different story. but the way he has love bombed you makes me believe that would be really difficult. and you should not hold onto your romantic feelings just for fear of making him feel bad. no contact would be best. the bottom line is that he KNEW he wasn’t “moved on” and yet he still hit you up, engaged with you and love bombed the fuck out of you, so he set you up for heartbreak and is definitely the AH
Yeah that definitely all makes sense. it’s so hard to explain the nuances of a relationship (and obvs i do not know the whole story lol). if you want to support him as a friend i think that’s fine, but it might be important for your own mental health that you do this without holding onto your romantic feelings. who knows if he’ll ever be ready, and if he is suicidal it’s probably better for him to not have any intense relationships that may affect his mood drastically anyway. like, i just don’t want you to be making your own mental health worse because you do care about him so much. please make sure to have care for yourself also. don’t let yourself become an emotional crutch/dump for him. you evidently do reflect on the relationship quite a bit, so i just hope you can maintain it in a way that is healthy for you but still supportive to him. maybe establishing strong platonic boundaries would be a good idea, or having a bit of a break to get over romantic feelings before fully engaging in a friendship. i wish you the best of luck :)"
My brothers want me to stop HRT just to be sure,9,trans,"Making yourself miserable to prove a point is rarely worth it. 

Your brothers are idiots, they don't get to make decision about your medication. Weither it's hrt or meds for your mental health, that's your choice alone, and if it work for you, then it's a good decision you made.

If they can't accept that you're living your best life, then they don't deserve to have any input.
Their arguments were invalid the moment they said to cold turkey your meds. Talk to your therapist about your meds if you feel the need to change them. Don't listen to people who don't know what the fuck they're talking about, especially when it comes to meds.

The thing about meds for mental health is, if they're the right meds for your issue, you should be feeling like you don't need meds because they're doing their job without significant side effects (ideally. Unfortunately not always the case). This is precisely when to keep taking them.

Cold turkey meds... of all the dumbass things...

As for HRT, they're spouting transphobic nonsense. If they're willing and attempting to get you to fuck with your meds just to stop HRT, they are not considering your best interest. At all. I don't know what they were like before you came out but you've stepped into their zone of hate by coming out. I recommend you be very skeptical of whatever they tell you.

Your dad seems cool though."
What am I doing in this marriage ,1,Marriage,"I realised a while ago that I accepted too much hurtful behaviour from others, by focusing only on why they did it, and not enough on the impact they had on me.

I would analyse and try to understand why they did what they did. Childhood trauma, mental health conditions, this or that.

And I would use those conclusions to excuse what they did. I thought that was compassion. I thought being understanding and forgiving would make me a better person. Because I thought maybe I wasn't a good enough person. 

All it really did was make me a doormat. And made me someone who did not ever prioritise my own feelings. It didn't matter if someone hurt me. It would be unkind to be angry at them for it. So I just swallowed it, and stayed unhappy.

I was just lacking in compassion for myself. It just didn't occur to me that I have a right to try and be happy too. That I don't have to tolerate bad behaviour from people just because they might have had a rough childhood or something.

Impact matters too. Your husband may not have done those things with the express purpose of hurting you. But he still did hurt you. That matters! You're a person, you matter!

You're basically saying that this marriage is massively hurting your mental health. But that you want to stay in it because he might have an addiction. And because you want your parents to not be concerned about you.

That is the absolute definition of setting yourself on fire to keep other people warm. Surely your parents would want you to be actually happy, not pretend happy? Happily divorced is a thing too...

Your husband is an adult. He has agency over his actions. If he is sick, he can get help. You were not placed on this earth to sacrifice yourself at the alter of someone else's problems. That is not what compassion is.

You deserve, at the very least, your own attention and compassion for yourself. Are you getting help for your struggles? Therapy? Because it sounds like you're drowning and you can't help anyone else if that happens anyway. I think you should spend some time bringing your focus back to yourself and taking care of you. If you build your strength that way, the rest of the answers may come more easily."
"It’s time, and I feel scared. ",16,StopGaming,"I've done the same thing I just contacted playstation to delete my data and account. What's the worse that's going to happen? I'll lose games I never touch anyways or the games I bought and never completed due to technology having a choke hold on my attention. Cut the losses do we even own digital games anyway? I'm using some of the money from my ps5 sale to get myself a nice guitar and I'm going to learn how to play and hopefully get myself back to the gym. Alot of areas in my life need work especially my mental health I suffer with OCD and anxiety so over the years I've made terrible coping methods to try and not be in my mind that's what scares me the nothingness.
Gaming never helps with trauma and mental health, i used to say that, gaming will make you think that you feel better but no in reality everytime you close that console or pc you will feel the same damages because you didn't face the problem and ran away so your injuries not mended you just used drugs to not feel it. I was the same and after all that time still needed to mend
I woke up today and made the decision. 
I’m gonna delete my steam account today and do a clean install on my computer and then put it up for sale. 
Enough is enough. Stop blaming the past for my mental health and start create good memories. 

Thanks dude ❤️ 
What do you think about the MacBook idea? At this moment I feel like I could handle it, and I keep journal everyday so it would be really nice to have it .
I don’t think anything bad will happen or so , it’s just hard to let go of something that’s been basically your entire life. The feeling of loneliness and a bit of stress about what you should do instead with all the free time. 

But my stress is kinda blown away already. I woke up today and usually on the weekends I fly up from bed and just bench myself in front of the computer. Today I stayed in bed. Just stared up in the ceiling and it was such a nice feeling. 

Gaming gives me stress. Stress about having to go to the store, and then cook food and all the other daily things when I just wanted to play games.
I have no stress now. It feels good doing these things. 

Yeah I’ve battled with undiagnosed ADHD until I turned 30, depression all my life and a lot of anxiety so I get where u coming from. But I blamed everything on the past for my mental health when the problem was right in front of my eyes."
Johns Hopkins: My Experience and broader concerns,0,maryland,"In general, I don't think it's possible to stereotype reactions to authority in various parts of the US in this way. And reading through this thread, it seems like what you perceive as a lack of empathy is people being generally confused at why it's bad that students already on academic probation ended up getting kicked out of JHU. Because of this, I don't think they're willing to engage with legitimate concerns like failure to accommodate medical conditions or the refusal to allow grade appeals (if that is normally common practice). It seems like it's a mix of people who might not have been a good fit for the program (or whose mental health struggles may have been a contributing factor in making them poor students) combined with some questionable at best administrative decisions. I guess the question is what you're hoping this post will accomplish. It's a private university so I'm not quite sure what you'd like Marylanders to do with this information.
I really get how complicated this situation is, but as I mentioned, r/Maryland has been uniquely dismissive of these concerns. Reading closely, it’s clear that the lack of checks and balances and the inability to appeal grades led many students to be put into probation unfairly, often for sketchy reasons. For instance, a racist professor discriminated against Black students, and the lack of oversight allowed professors to have unchecked power over their students’ academic fates. In Adam’s story, if Christina Harnett had agreed to give him an incomplete like every other professor did, he would’ve graduated. And many of the students in the story were only forced into academic probation after they revealed disabilities and professors began treating them more harshly as a result. 

The systemic issues I’m highlighting—like the inability to appeal grades and the lack of accommodations—are critical to understanding why students are struggling. While there may be individual factors at play, that doesn’t negate the need for accountability and reform within the program. Additionally, mental health conditions are ADA-protected, meaning universities have a responsibility to provide appropriate support.

The program is even having trouble hiring new faculty because these stories are well-known within the counseling community. My goal in sharing this is to raise awareness of these issues and foster understanding, encouraging a more constructive conversation about how to improve the situation for current and future students

Btw, people were more sympathetic 2 years ago when it first came out, funnily enough: https://archive.ph/wip/QNSDt
Here, just from reddit. Otherwise, a lot more convo in the field goes on outside reddit as you can probably guess. I’m connected with quite a few therapists and therapy profs in the state given my background and yes, the program has a toxic rep. Some local sites even no longer work with the program to do internships now. Loyola’s program even reached out to Katie saying they couldn’t believe what happened to her and invited her to apply to their program. Counselors vote with their feet by avoiding working at the program, hence they had to make some adjuncts fi time just to get their numbers to 11 (was 15 in 2019). This summer, [they even posted a desperate hire for an 1-year-term faculty for this school year](https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/37694968/lecturer/#:~:text=The%20Johns%20Hopkins%20University%20School,and%20Clinical%20Mental%20Health%20Counseling.): **it’s almost October and no one filled the position.** Over 15 testimonials submitted to the Office of Civil Rights too just one this one program.

Regarding the original post that caused so much backlash here, therapists subreddit was sympathetic and even got reddit gold from it: https://archive.ph/DwgPx

The backlash on r/maryland also did not occur on the Hopkins subreddit. other posters shared struggles in another department: https://archive.ph/wip/5GQXN

One example, you might've heard of Sheppard Pratt, a pretty big and well known mental health system in the area. They have big issues with JHU Counseling because the program teaches that Dissociative Identity Disorder doesn't exist, and other problematic things. Also, when we first lost our accreditation our Dean rashly sent an email to every supervisor in Maryland saying that JHU would allow students to graduate early then have them finish their internship credits afterwards so they can be grandfathered into CACREP, which is illegal. After this happened, a lot of JHU graduates had more trouble finding jobs for awhile. 

**A student who managed to graduate sent me this. She, and many others, were also forced onto probation plans. Even JHU's equity office admitted that the program was giving them out inappropriately:** 

*I am a student with documented disabilities. I had a terrible experience with a professor last year in my first semester. I was working on a group project and there was a lot of confusion in my group about what was expected for the project. I was the only person that was brave enough to ask the professor for clarity. I wanted to advocate for my group because they didn't feel comfortable asking. I then heard from one of my group members that the professor complained about me asking so many questions. Then I got a phone call on a Sunday morning from the professor in which she said “I know you have disabilities, but not all your professors are going to be as understanding as I am”. I was NOT having any problems in any of my other classes or with other professors. Her class was the only class in which this was an issue. When I told her that I was asking these questions on behalf of other students in the class, she didn't believe me and told me that I was the only one that she was getting questions from. I then told my classmates that I refused to ask any more questions of the professor and that they had to ask them themselves.*

*When I shared this experience with other people, they told me I should speak to my advisor about it but unfortunately this professor is my advisor. This experience left such a bad taste in my mouth that I no longer trust my advisor. Now I feel like I am often lost in the dark not knowing about important information about the program because I'm too scared to ask my advisor.*

*I have a lot of deep-seated trauma from the experience I had as a disabled student in public school growing up. I wanted to become a school counselor so that other people didn't have the same experience that I did. But the way that I've been treated in this program has been retraumatizing and brings back a lot of memories from my childhood. I hate it when people in my life inquire about my grad school experience because I have nothing positive to share. I would never recommend this program to anyone, ever. I have gone into a life time of debt and have to spend the rest of my life paying off my student loans for a program that has mutilated my spirit.*

**A second student**

*I'm not sure if this can help, but I wanted to share something I went through in my internship that seemed extremely unfair. I do not have a disability, but it was enough to put me on blood pressure medication and anxiety medication which seemed counterproductive for a counseling grad student*

*I did the program in school counseling. My internship supervisor was Dr. X. When the time came to make my video, I discussed it with my site supervisor and we decided I would use a student with whom I had formed a good relationship and had ongoing sessions. This student had a long history of trauma and often doubted her ability to cope with issues as they arose. Before the video, my site supervisor and I went over the content we would discuss in detail and my site supervisor was very excited about what I had planned. I had the student come in for the video and tell me about her week, then we did an activity where she wrote coping skills on paper tools and put them in a paper toolbox. I showed the video, and Dr. X called me into her office the next day. She proceeded to tell me that my video was one of the most unethical she had ever seen, and if I ever did something like that again, she ""would not hesitate to kick [me] out of the program so fast [my] head would spin."" I still don't really understand it, but I guess because I led the student in an activity and didn't just let her ramble about soccer for a half hour, I breached some kind of ethical guideline? My site supervisor was furious and both she and her supervisor said that they would defend me against the university if it came to that. I'm now in my 4th year as a school counselor and regularly tell kids ""we're not gonna talk about that - either do this project or go back to class."" If only Dr. X could see me now.....*

*I always thought it was ironic that in a program that was supposed to be teaching us to be compassionate and empathetic professionals, most of the professors had no compassion or empathy. I never felt like I could make a mistake - I felt like the gatekeeping meant I had to be perfect 100% of the time. Since moving to another city and working with interns at other programs where growth and mistakes are encouraged, it makes me sad that Hopkins, with such a great reputation, makes their students so neurotic and fearful.*

Anyway, it's valid to question the credibility of students who couldn’t maintain their grades. However, I think it’s important to acknowledge that the issues being raised go beyond individual academic performance. These students weren’t simply struggling with coursework—they were often placed on probation after revealing disabilities or facing other forms of discrimination, which suggests that their academic difficulties were exacerbated by a lack of appropriate support and unfair treatment. Revealing disabilities made things much stricter and less supportive for them (such as Katie being forced to work with COVID positive clients unlike other students, and the unfair treatment subsequently tanking her mental health and performance).

Again, even the students you don't sympathize with were put on a path to struggle and failure that could have been entirely avoided if the program had been less toxic and more supportive. For example, if Christina Harnett had agreed to give Adam an incomplete, like other professors did, he would have graduated instead of being forced into a situation where he ultimately couldn’t succeed.

The systemic problems I’m highlighting—like the inability to appeal grades, lack of accommodations, and unchecked power given to professors—are broader issues that can affect any student, regardless of their academic standing. The reputation JHU is developing in the counseling field reflects these deeper concerns. **It’s telling that they’ve struggled to hire new faculty, and their enrollment has dropped significantly in just one year since these articles became public. My own advisor is gone now.** 

While I understand your experience with nursing, business, and med students didn’t reflect these issues, each department operates differently. The problems in the counseling program may not be as visible in other areas, but that doesn’t negate their existence. I’m sharing these stories to raise awareness because these aren’t isolated incidents—they’re part of a larger pattern that needs addressing"

Muslim/Arab Context for Love is Blind Habibi,161,LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,"As someone who grew up Muslim, I’m very curious how this will all play out. 

Kissing/hand holding, not sure if that’ll happen. Sex between couples? I think most likely not happening. Besides physical touch, there’s an emphasis in Arab culture about family, reputation, and success. You must be family oriented (and usually wanting start a family), be a good member amongst your community and come from a “good family”, and you should have either a good paying job or a good degree (in medicine, law, or engineering).

And let’s not forget mental health. Not something where people are as open about in the Middle East. What happens if someone’s anxious or depressed… I’m curious if they’ll take about it or sweep it under the rug.

And expectations and traditional gender roles. I wonder how this will be navigated. I hope misogyny doesn’t overwhelm the season.

Lastly the in-laws! Or future in-laws I’d say. They’ll probably have a lot of power here and much more of a say than what Americans are used to. Disappointing your parents is highly looked down upon, even if they are against your relationship, you have to sacrifice your partner for someone your parents fully approve of.

There’s more nuance but just what I thought about immediately. I hope people are open-minded to this LIB experience and understand different cultures have different customs."

AITA for not wanting to take my future infant daughter to my mom’s house? ,4,AITAH,"Considering how far gone the situation has gotten, I think the best way to help your mother and brother is to call your local board of health/health department.

The post I shared speaks directly to the heart of what I’m talking about, not the individual responsibility or egocentrism you’re referring to. It’s about the collective struggle we’re facing as social workers and mental health providers—fighting a system that continues to turn its back on both us and the vulnerable populations we serve. The issue isn’t about individuals trying to play the savior, but rather the lack of systemic support from lawmakers and organizations like MCOs. This is about advocating for the profession, for justice, and for those who rely on us, while acknowledging the pain and frustration of feeling left to fight alone.

The post reflects the deeper commitment we have as social workers, grounded in our core values of social justice and service. It’s about refusing to accept apathy from those in power and continuing to fight for a system that supports both providers and clients. This isn’t an egocentric fight—it’s a collective one, rooted in our ethical obligation to stand up for what’s right, even when it feels like the world isn’t listening.
Ah, there it is—thinking in singular. That’s exactly the issue. The overwhelming majority of social workers and mental health providers thrive on collective action. Research consistently shows that collaborative care models improve outcomes for clients—studies from the *Journal of Interprofessional Care* and *Social Work in Health Care* make it clear that teamwork is essential in addressing complex needs and improving health outcomes. If we stick with this ‘I’ instead of ‘we’ mentality, it’s no wonder the system is falling apart. Viewing this work through a singular lens only pushes our profession—and the vulnerable populations we serve—into a deeper crisis. We’re already facing a critical shortage of mental health providers, with demand rising and financial strain increasing on individual providers.

You absolutely have the right to your autonomy and perspective, which I respect—but it’s not just me who refuses to sit back and be silent. There’s a growing movement within our profession that rejects the passive, singular approach. Groups of providers across the country—like *The Behavioral Health Provider Alliance* and *The Psychotherapy Action Network*—are joining forces to fight for real reform. These grassroots efforts are tackling critical issues like fair reimbursement rates, reducing provider burnout, and improving access to mental health care for underserved communities. Providers are recognizing that collective action is the only way to bring about the meaningful changes we all need. Maybe it’s time to look through a different lens—because isolation isn’t going to move the needle, but unified action will."
A Psychiatrist Descents Into Spiritual Psychosis ,14,Psychosis,"Is this your own true story? I just ask as you submitted a post to r/no sleep.

I just ask because my brief psychosis was triggered by the suicide of a colleague on my mental health placement at a psychiatric hospital. Through the aftermath and everything I went through, I learned that one of the hospital buildings was named after a psychiatrist that died by suicide.  When I was in hospital, there was a doctor who was an inpatient too. I just want to say that, as you probably know, you are far from alone from having the experience of a professional and a patient. It’s probably one of the most distressing and confusing parts of the experience really. When you realise you’re just as fallible as everyone else. You did a brilliant job of writing, it’s definitely a good outlet to try and move forward from the experience."

AITA my wife wants to be friends with the guy she had her affair with.,954,AITAH,"Your wife's actions are unacceptable and disrespectful. Your feelings are valid, and prioritizing your mental health is important. Divorce might be the best option for you to move forward and heal.
YTA if you stay.  In What World should you apologize to the guy that was having an affair with your wife and he came to your house.  OMG you need to grow up and throw her out.  What is wrong?  She is throwing it in your face, she is gaslighting you into blaming yourself? and comparing you to her mother.  It doesn't matter she has nowhere to go, she can go to her other man or her mommas house.  How did you get his phone number?

You talk about mental health staying with her is going to make you worse and worse. Really hundreds of people get divorced and they live through it and thrive.  How do you think living like this affects your children.  You are teaching them living in a toxic unhealthy environment is the norm and they will look for that in their own relationships.  Move on for the kids sake and your own.
You're not the asshole for setting boundaries with your wife regarding her contact with the man she had an affair with. Given the emotional toll the affair has taken on you, it's completely reasonable to want distance from someone who caused so much pain. Her accusations of you being controlling seem like deflection from the real issue her lack of respect for your feelings and your marriage. You've tried to move forward, but her continued contact with the affair partner and using it to upset you is damaging, especially when you've been open about your feelings. Offering divorce is not controlling but a way to protect your emotional well-being. Considering the advice from your family, friends, co-workers, and therapist, prioritizing your mental health and the well-being of your kids might be the best option. Staying in a situation where you feel emotionally wrecked could cause more harm than good in the long run.
You're definitely not the asshole for wanting to keep your wife away from the guy she cheated with. It's like asking your dog to be friends with the mailman after he bites them. Just a bad idea. You’ve set boundaries and prioritized your mental health, which is smart. If she wants to keep that friendship, maybe it’s time to consider a divorce. You deserve a relationship where you feel respected, not like a bad roommate with benefits.
Okay, wow, this is intense! 💔 Honestly, your feelings are totally valid. Your wife wanting to be friends with her affair partner? That’s a huge red flag. It’s not controlling to set boundaries after what she did. You deserve to feel safe and respected in your own home, especially around your kids. If she’s not willing to work on rebuilding trust, maybe it’s time to seriously think about that divorce. You shouldn’t have to feel like a “bad roommate” when you deserve so much more. Focus on your mental health—you’re already doing therapy, which is a step in the right direction! Just remember, you’re not alone in this. 💪❤️
Bruh....'. My family, friends, co-workers, and therapist all say divorce is in my best interest. Especially for my mental health.' ....who else are you waiting for to tell you what you should do? Devine Intervention? 

At this point, you're just being a jackass to yourself.

Christ, if you dont want to do it for yourself, atleast do it for your kids. Raising kids in a broken family is so much more worse then in a seperated household.

Get a grip and have some self respect my guy.
If you look at my brief posting history, you’ll see I almost NEVER advocate divorce.

Almost.  She has violated almost every vow you take on your wedding day. And she doesn’t seem all that apologetic or remorseful at all.

Not only am I recommending divorce here, but I’m recommending you do it quickly for the sake of your own mental healthy.
NTA. Your wife is gaslighting you and clearly has no respect for your feelings. You deserve better than this toxic situation and staying for the sake of your children is not worth your mental health. It's time to put yourself first and move on from this unhealthy relationship. Good luck with the divorce process and I hope you find healing and happiness.
NTA. It's not controlling to not want your wife's affair partner around your house and kids. Your mental health and well-being should come first, and it's not worth staying in a toxic and hurtful relationship for the sake of your children. It's important to prioritize your own healing and moving forward in a healthy way. Good for you for standing up for yourself and reaching out for legal help. You deserve to be respected and treated better.
You should divorce her. For your own mental health
FFS why did you think you had to apologize to this asshole? Maybe he didn't know in the beginning but now that he knows everything he still doesn't step back.

Your wife is a POS and belongs to the streets. She sadistically reminds you of the affair rubbing the details on your face to inflict pain.

She belongs to the streets, she is not sorry and on the first chance she will reconnect with the asshole or someone else.

Continue with the divorce, regain your self respect and mental health.

They're correct and most of us internet strangers agree. Your wife does not respect you, let alone love you. Leave her
Please please divorce her. It’s not worth ruining your mental health. If she has nowhere to go that’s on her.
OMG, you’re totally not the a\*\*hole here! Your wife had an affair and now wants to be friends with the guy? That’s just messed up. You deserve to feel safe and respected in your relationship. It’s not controlling to set boundaries after what she did. Honestly, if she can’t see how hurtful this is, maybe you need to think about that divorce. Your mental health matters way more than trying to keep the peace. Don’t let her manipulate you with guilt—stick to your feelings and protect yourself! 💔✨
NTA.  I’m so sorry you are going through this.  You don’t deserve this treatment.   She should NOT have gone out with her affair partner for a coffee.  She should be NC.  If she can’t respect you enough to go NC then it’s time to move on.  At the end of the day it will be better for your and your kids mental health.  Also, I would get DNA tests on all your kids.  
NTA - I don’t know what this hell is but it isn’t marriage/partnership. It’s certainly not love or respect. 

You should leave for your children’s sake as well as your own mental health. They learn the examples of relationships and personal self respect from you both, they’re already screwed with someone like your wife as their mother. So it falls to you to show what someone who respects themselves does when they’re facing awful treatment from a “loved one”. 

Once you’ve hit the panic attack stage, it’s difficult to return to system balance but it’s not even close to impossible. Divorce the stressor, keep going with the therapy and find the small joys in life until your mind clears. 

Give yourself the chance to know real love. It has its organic highs and lows, but it doesn’t come with deception, betrayal and an anxiety disorder. 

Best of luck!! 🍀
If you choose your “ego”!

Isn’t that true, you choose your mental health which is more important than anything!

Because if you fall into serious depression!

Who will feed your children, not her!

Who won't suffer is you!

she's just selfish!

She just wants to manipulate you!

Is told to him that she chooses the sex of her children depressing!
It sounds like you’re in a really tough situation. Your feelings are valid, and it’s important to prioritize your emotional well-being. If your wife is unwilling to respect your boundaries, it may be necessary to seriously consider your options, including divorce. Continue focusing on your therapy and support system. Your mental health is crucial, especially for your kids. It’s okay to seek peace for yourself.
the fact she thinks its ok to be friends with this person, criticizes you for losing your cool to towards this other dude for coming around is absolutely wild to me.

  
for your mental health please move on.  she has no respect for you, she cuckolded you and you deserve better.  move on.
Updateme: NTA, but your wife is one for sure. She's manipulating you to staying with her while still wanting to emotionally/physically cheat on you. Why did you apologise to the AP? That's just shows them you're a pushover. You need to start putting your mental health first. So you need to either apply for separation first or just straight out divorce her (suggest her to move out unless you want her AP to come over your house when you're not around).
YTA for not divorcing her sooner. You're hurting your children here by showing them she can walk all over you, and not thinking that they can't sense that something is wrong between mom and dad. Hurting your own mental health is going to impact them. My father stayed with my mother for 2 years after she cheated on him and she proceeded to do it AGAIN and then SHE filed for divorce shortly after. I was 8 and this fucking hurt me. It hurt to watch them fight and him basically be her punching bag. This big strong man who was and is my idol and hero being brought low by my cheating lying whore of a mother. Even knowing what she was doing was wrong, it still impressed upon me this fucked up idea that women are allowed to abuse men all they like and a man isn't supposed to defend himself. And so when a woman sexually assaulted me I did nothing to defend myself. I cowered like he did to my mother's abuse. It took years to reflect on what happened to me and deprogram this idea of never defending yourself against a woman. Against men who attempted, defending myself was second nature, but against a woman I fucking froze and cowered out. THAT is what you're teaching your children, that it's okay to abuse men so long as the abuser is a woman. For your kids sake you need to grow a fucking spine and exit this marriage.
This is a joke, right? Man, you gotta get a spine and tell her to fuck off. This gonna sound rough, but Jesus Christ... You texted him and apologized for running at the car? I get it, he might not have known the situation because your wife lied to him at first, but he damn sure knows  now. I wouldn't even pretend to consider letting my wife be friends with someone that she cheated on my with. I would have divorced her after gathering enough evidence to support me in court and  take her to court for custody. I know that wouldn't be easy, but I'd still go that route. Your kids are seeing this play out to some degree, at the very least they are feeling the ""vibe"". Time to show them how a strong man handles business. For your mental health, and for their future.
If your therapist is telling you that a decision is the best one they recommend for your mental health, then listen to them. She doesn't care about you at all. Leave her

NTA
Don't be an idiot...staying with a cheater is not benefiting the kids in any way, shape, or form. You think the kids want to be exposed to you two fighting and her cheating? You think hurting your mental health helps the kids at all? Divorce the garden tool and file custody for the kids.
NTA, what you're actually doing, in ""staying for the kids"", is teaching them to be a doormat and that cheating is A OK. Leave. It's in your and your children's best interest, and best for your mental health and feelings of self worth.
>My family, friends, co-workers, and therapist all say divorce is in my best interest. Especially for my mental health

Your own therapist feels this shit show is over, maybe you should listen.
What dux I just read?

She doesn't respect you. She cheats on you. She doesn't care about your feelings. She doesn't value your boundaries.  She doesn't work but expects you to continue financing this toxic marriage?  

My dear, she's treating you like a doormat. Your support group is not wrong when they say you have to make changes for your mental health.

Congrats on your first steps on divorce.  

I'm so sorry for your kids though. NTA, but you married one. I have no doubt that it may take a while, but your kids will figure this out on their own too.
Your family friends coworkers and therapist say to divorce? So do internet strangers. Divorce her ass and improve your mental health immensely.
Y'all need Jesus, holy shit. I'm not even religious but so many people on this sub desperately need Jesus to guide their lives because clearly some guidance is needed. 

You're NTA. Stick to the plan and get a divorce, you will be much happier than staying with this horrible person you are dealing with. 

>My family, friends, co-workers, and therapist all say divorce is in my best interest. Especially for my mental health.

  
Please listen to your family, friends, co-workers, and therapist. I really hope the next update they get from you is that you are free from this nightmare or at least actively in the process of being legally liberated from this nightmare. 

She is abusing you at every corner in some of the cruelest, most heinous ways. 

I don't know anything about you but based on what you are posting, your soon-to-be-ex-wife should have extremely limited contact with  the children because she is a terrible, awful influence.
Please let her go as this will have a tremendous effect on your mental health.
“ My family, friends, co-workers, and therapist all say divorce is in my best interest. Especially for my mental health.”

Mad you came here for advice when everyone who cares about you already told you. Go well.
Your mental health is what is important for and for your children’s mental health. Living in a house with anger and resentment will harm your children more. Glad you are getting away from someone who is a cheater and a liar. I hope you can get some therapy to get over the feelings you have been bottling up inside.
I've seen your update& am glad to hear you're going to see the divorce attorney.. Please do not let her convince you of anything, just stop listening to her at all costs ... Your mental health is the most important thing and for her to say you're acting like her mom with past bf's is ridiculous, if she wasn't trying to have boyfriends while married none of this would be happening.. What does she bring to the table besides stress in your life? I understand you have kids but you don't want them seeing their dad have to live like this, they need to know they deserve love from their partner.. You deserve love!!! If you ever need an unbiased ear to listen my DM's are open, please stand firm in this.. It will be hard but you will come out the other side and gradually you will find happiness in yourself.. You deserve at least that!
Your wife sounds like a complete sociopath. She has zero remorse for her actions and tries to manipulate you by turning herself into the victim. She has no respect for you. She made her choice long ago, she chose her boyfriend over you and your kids. She blew up the family, not you. Your mental health is important. Divorce her and move on. She can see the kids on weekends. Let her boyfriend worry about taking care of her from here on out. Good luck
>My family, friends, co-workers, and therapist all say divorce is in my best interest. Especially for my mental health.

And you're not listening to any of them?
I don’t know why you need to be reassured to do the right thing for yourself and the kids. It’s clear as day you need to get divorced and get her out of your life! 

I cannot believe her calling you selfish hasn’t caused you to turn that on her and say she’s the one that was selfish when she cheated and continues to be selfish by seeing this person. She’s at fault for everything wrong in your relationship and is the cause of your divorce. She is the cause of your mental health issues, your wrecked emotions, and yet she has the audacity to go out with this man again and have him drop her off at your house only to tell you not to get divorced for the sake of the kids? Get divorced now and don’t worry about her anymore. She clearly doesn’t respect you or wants you so why should you continue caring about her? Give your all to your kids, to your mental health, and in due time you’ll find someone who will love you and respect you. Best of luck!
Your wife and a cold, selfish and disrespectful! She doesn't love you nor does she respect you. To have her love come to your house to stop her off is mind blowing! How dare you call him to apologize for yelling at him!!  You should've divorce when she first cheated. Because you didn't,  now your mental health is in jeopardy.
No offense taken, my mental health I’m has been pushed to the limits. And she’s been taking full advantage of it and warping my thoughts. When I barged out to confront him I had a completely different mindset than apologizing for anything. I was going to vent everything at him. Then she and I argued after he bolted off and she did her thing. Where she makes me think I was int eh wrong. I wanted to tell him off but at that point my fire had burned out and that’s the best  came up with. Yes I’m not proud of that response and definitely not what I would have said. But I stated the sheriff will be involved if he shows up again and I absolutely will uphold that.

I called the attorney and getting that started up again.  I have plenty of evidence I need to support all my claims. The kids also are definitely mine.
Her telling me she slept with this guy right before our anniversary and first couples therapy session absolutely broke me. Like if my mental health was a 80/100 it went down to 3/100 it hurt terribly. We went to the session she didn’t say anything and we didn’t go again after. Then she started getting abusive towards me, started with calling me names, yelling screaming, and moved to throwing and breaking things, wrecking the house and finally hitting me. My left eye has permanent damage. It’s not a lot but it’s still there. I was broken and didn’t know how the fuck to handle anything. I wasn’t like that before just that blow killed a huge part of me.
She has a way with word and turning thing around and my mental health has been in shambles the past year. I’m doing my best to just stay afloat.
Only option.  For the record she is gaslighting you by saying you are being controlling.  Remaining in contact with affair partner when she claims to not want a divorce is the most unbelievable thing I’ve ever heard. 

Also don’t take care of the guys feelings.  He can handle it.  Don’t apologize for yelling even if your wife lied to him and said it was open.  

You only have one thing to worry about right now which is your mental health which includes getting your divorce settled.  Kids will be fine, especially given how volatile your relationship is.  You don’t want to model to them that this is ok.
OP, this is horrible! 

From now on, record EVERYTHING! Every outburst, conversation, and confrontation. Document EVERYTHING!

I’m pretty sure she will accuse you of being abusive and controlling during the divorce to get full custody of your kids so she can weaponize them against you. She’s not your wife, she’s your nightmare, and you must get rid of her.

Don’t stay for the kids. What kind of example do you want to set for them? That it’s best to stay with a cheating, manipulative and abusive partner so your kids can live in a toxic household?

You need to do what’s best for you and your mental health.

NTA
You rug swept what happened, she never had to face what she did to you. You can’t heal because the wound was never cleaned. If you want to stay then I would suggest you find a marriage counselor who specializes in infidelity and work on healing. If not that wound will fester for your entire life, and when your son is grown it will destroy your mental health, you’ll have nothing to hang staying with her on. It could shorten your life. Better to be a part time Dad then a dead one at 65."
Red flags I learned about in therapy that could have helped me spot my pedophile husband sooner,43,emotionalabuse,"I share your grief, my child also has an abusive pedophile as a father. He never got caught, unfortunately. There are so many of us who have been through this, and it’s rare that they get caught so here we are trying to put the pieces together of life without extended help or understanding. Because it’s a story I can’t share with many, since ultimately it’s not my story to share. 

From another tiger mom, I’m sending you the biggest hugs there is! And a high five for surviving and continuing to protect and support your children. I know your strength. 

I’m worried each day for the consequences of my child’s mental health in the future. Especially reaching puberty and when and if my child will ever remember. 

Being strong is just my first name. And from what I read of what you’re sharing that applies to you too! One step at a time. My child was around seven when it never happened again. So it was many years ago now. But it’s a sorrow that will follow me in the shadows forever."
Wife(f28) held a talent show at our wedding reception. Her friend who sang networked with a guest who wants to potentially work with her. She has become bitter since,4309,BestofRedditorUpdates,"If her friends never saw this side of her, I wonder if she had some kind of mental health issue come up that was triggered by wedding stress. 
Sounds like some significant mental health issues emerged as a result of this, and divorce is the right way for it to end. The ex-wife really needs to seek help before she implodes her entire life.
That's not immaturity. That's a mental health issue. Something broke in her and a problem that's been there surfaced.
Some thoughts:


Possible factor: schizophrenia and similar are portrayed to be creators of demented or monsterous people in the media and so becomes common 'knowledge'. If you look at your daughter with that 'knowedge' in your subconscious, then confirmation bias kicks in and you ignore/dismiss it: 'My daughters not a crazy monster, so she doesn't have it'. 


Also, unless you work in mental health or related fields, most people don't know accurate symptom presentations for the myriad of known mental illnesses. And even if they did, if they're in America, you can understand the reluctance to go to a doctor.
Agreed. She’s got all these rational, kind friends who are good communicators. OP seems rational and kind. In my experience, if you’ve got a bunch of wonderful people around you, you’re probably wonderful too. Now she’s all of a sudden basically burning her whole life to the ground? My first thought was a mental health issue, as a result.
If the family hasn't dealt with one of the 'big scary' mental health illnesses before, they probably don't have any idea that this could be an indicator. 


In fact, if someone has been reasonable and kind their whole life, when they start accusing friends of ganging up on them their family likely think they're telling the truth.


It's easy to recognise something is wrong when they claim a demon is telling them to set fire to the house and they'll be fine because they'll grow wings and escape. 


Someone you trust coming to you and saying ""turns out my friends were all talking behind my back and set me up for humiliation"" is very different. It's plausible, even though shocking and something you'd never have thought possible. 


Until she turns on her family, with something impossible, it's unlikely to be seen as truly worrying."
Dogs and Service Animals in stores/shops,9,LegalAdviceUK,"As I understand it, service dogs which are protected by law are defined as being dogs which have been:

  
trained to **guide a blind person**

* trained to **assist a deaf person**
* trained by a prescribed charity to **assist somebody who has a disability such as epilepsy** that affects mobility (or similar), **or**
* trained to assist somebody with **another prescribed disability**

Obviosuly anxiety orother mental health issues could be a disability, but it appears that the definition also refers to the dog being specifcically *trained ,*  which the dog's beahviour and the fact it is still a puppy, seem to suggest are not the case.

Also, it may be reasonbale to deny access if it is reasonable to do so - the dog jumping up, interfering with out cusotmers or staff \*\*might\*\* mean it was reasonable to tell the owner they needed to remove or calm the dog . 

Emotional Supprot animials are nt covered by the equalities act so thre is no obligation to allo it in at all, although allowing it might be a reasonable adjustment for a disability if the mental health issues are a disability. 

It may be that the best way forward would be to tell him that trained service dgos are of course permitted into the buiness but per the ECHC guidance, servce dogs are ""likely to sit or lie quietly on the floor next to their owner, unlikely to wander freely around the premises, unlikely to foul in a public place"" and that for the safety and welbeing of other cutomers and staff, if he is unable to ensure that his dog behves in that way, then he will be asked to leave
It would depend whether his ‘mental health’ problem met the definition of ‘disability’ under the Equality Act 2010 and, if it did, whether banning the dog was a ‘proportionate means’ of achieving the ‘legitimate aim’ of maintaining hygiene.  As regards proportionality, I would speculate that banning an emotional support dog would have a lesser impact on a mentally disabled person’s ability to shop than, say, a visually impaired disabled person’s guide dog. 

Edit: curious as to the downvotes given I’m in support of OP and the consensus. The only difference is I’ve assessed it according to the actual legal tests. Theoretically, depending on the facts there is the potential for indirect discrimination (the status of the dog does not preclude a discrimination claim - it’s more about its necessity, among the other factors), and banning the customer is dangerous because it could be construed as being in response to claiming to be eligible (even though he probably isn’t), which would amount to ‘victimisation’ under section 27."

I am glad u made this post honestly the previous post about their relationship was so bad like people nowadays assume many things just because they have not come out of Splits and believing their favs are best and others are worst..
Coming to anicka I always had a soft corner for her in the show but she wasn't my fav but after splits the amount of respect I have for this women I mean she could easily do a lot of things and create controversies when others tried to drag her down but she preferred to be silent always never said anything bad about others always focused on herself , got trolled for many things be it her choice of friends or bf her previous works or her mental health .but i am glad  that she focused on herself and I wish she does very good in her life.

"Let's Discuss Criticism, Constructive Criticism and Hate",6,EducatingShanny,"Absolutely 1000%, Alison!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 I'm reading a current book right now all about habits and mindfulness and how to do the work to break the unhealthy or harmful habits we all are likely guilty of (ranging in severity and type and focus, of course) and introduce mindfulness and more CONSCIOUS awareness of when we would normally go into autopilot to engage in the unhealthy habit versus becoming more aware and an observer of the thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations (i.e. the mindfulness aspects, nonjudgmental stance and turning compassion inwards) and then doing the opposite of whatever the action urge is. It's called **""The Here and Now Habit"" (2016) by Hugh G Byrne PhD** I got it from the library, actually. Finally reading it this time and it's my new current book project! 😁😀🤩

&#x200B;

Support is certainly helpful and great but Shanny is missing the CRUCIAL link between accountable accountability, responsibility, toughness and structure that such specific ED and mental health programs would offer (as you've stated). If she could do it all on her own, she would have recovered years ago. But, she can't, doesn't have to, and it won't work nearly as effectively if she just let down her walls and let someone from the professional sphere of things help her out and teach her the skills she needs to replace the unhealthy behaviors. 

That would require some insight, a want to change, a desire for a better life and stripping herself from the parasocial, inappropriate and unhealthy relationships she's cultivated for years with her audience. Which is a hefty task. Still possible though. Just makes it all a little less likely to happen--Shanny might see it as having to give up something she thought she was or wished to be and coming to grips with everything she's actually done to people over the years which could be a lot and rather heavy. It's *still* worth it because her life is important and matters, I just wish she'd allow herself to see that, exist in that, BE in that and live in that. But alas, I've gone on the tangents again.... 

Thanks for reading and stopping by, Alison!! Neuroplasticity is always an interesting topic. 💜💜💙💙🩵🩵🧠🧠🧠
Neuroplasticity is the ability for our brains to form new connections in order to function.  They used to think this ended in childhood, but we form new connections throughout our life.  A good example is when you move houses.  You might drive halfway home only to find out you were driving to the old house.  That's Neuroplasticity - you have a hardwired neuro connection that automatically thinks of home as the place you used to live.  Over time, with repeatedly reminding yourself of your new location, the new house becomes home, and becomes the new ""automatic"" home connection you make when commuting back to your house.

I'm not sure how it works with personality deficits after a disruption, but for physical stuff like talking and walking after an accident, it's teaching the person to reconnect the intact brain tissue to circumvent the damaged parts.  More than one area of the brain works to perform all of our functions, and they work together.  So the person might need to relearn speech through their ability to sing, for example.  They might not remember how to speak, but since singing comes from a creative side of the brain, they may remember that function.  So over time their ability to sing will help them tap into their ability to build words into sentences.  Very fascinating.

When it comes to an undamaged brain creating new connections, it's all about weakening the existing neuro connections by not indulging in them and actively choosing a new response to the same stimuli, every time.  That's why ED treatment can work for bulimia if a person wants it.  At a treatment center they are given calculated meals catered to their needs, already prepared.  They are not given enough for a proper binge.  They are also being monitored on their bathroom use afterwards, and have staff and other patients to help them work through hard feelings.  But with enough time and real effort and desire, a person can and will recover from anything.  

Neuroplasticity is also now being used for mental health, EMDR is a great example - trying to neutralize the body's natural response to certain memories or triggers."

Good description, action, and characterization here.

The rest of the scene is primal carnage and shockingly efficient brutality and a bit of delightful gore. I love it all. You covered it well. It's polished and proficient. But I'm curious where you needed critique. What questions did you have?

I didn't find anything to tear apart. Patient 22 is a total badass, apparently having gone through some kind of behavior modification that may have activated hidden potentials in the human gene pool. The text doesn't answer any questions in that regard. Perhaps it could give some hints, some motivation for his indiscriminate rampage. Without that, it's just an impressively one-sided escape. Clearly this has happened before, so it seems unlikely that the facility would be this unprepared. Maybe it could be updated with tiny slivers of dialogue revealing which new countermeasures have utterly failed; that might give the reader more candy to savor.

So yeah, great job. I'm interested to see where this goes and how this kind of ancient and forbidden discovery results in something new for your readers."
Am I wrong for ending my friendship with my best friend?,27,amiwrong,"You’re not wrong for ending the friendship. Your ex-best friend repeatedly ghosted you during times when you needed support, didn’t take accountability, and failed to communicate. Friendships should be about mutual respect and support, and it sounds like this one was one-sided. You did what was best for your mental health, and setting boundaries is important, especially when someone repeatedly lets you down. It’s understandable to expect basic communication and care, especially at this stage in life.
Also, some mental health disorders do not make an appearance until later. Good luck. Just remember, you deserve better. You have worth, even if that former friend refuses to see it."
