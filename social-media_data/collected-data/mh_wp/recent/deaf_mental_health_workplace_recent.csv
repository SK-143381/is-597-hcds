how did you make the decision to get/not to get hearing aids as an adult? (mini vent),4,deaf,"I have been HoH my whole life (28F) and got hearing aids two years ago. It did change my life. For a long time, I just didn’t think I “needed” them. But it was very isolating and anxiety-inducing being left out of conversations at home and in public, not to mention how exhausting it was to try and keep up with conversations I couldn’t hear. There’s also a lot of research on HAs and brain health (minimizes risk of dementia), so that alone is a big factor for me too since my hearing is progressively getting worse. 

As for the internalized ableism, your family, and the stubbornness: I’m sorry your family hasn’t been supportive of your other disabilities. I had to learn how to be my own advocate over the years. I feel that I am still learning too. After I got HAs, I followed a bunch of Deaf advocates online. You can have HAs and still continue learning ASL.They have really nice ones that are very discreet. I work with children and families as a mental health therapist, and almost all of my families have never noticed my HAs.

Good luck to you ❣️
My mom is the only family I’m connected to, I’m estranged from my dad (who raised me), my sisters, and his entire side of the family for various reasons. There was a period of time where I was no contact with my mom but for the past year and a half we’ve been trying to rebuild our relationship. I feel like I can’t get her to work on all of the issues at once (queerness, gender, class, disability) so I’m taking it one step at a time. I have boundaries for my mental health’s sake, but it is hard to know when to continue holding on to a relationship if it’s holding me back from doing things that are positive for me.

I’m definitely going to bring this up in therapy, would love to find someone who is well versed in navigating this experience but right now I’m still “shopping” around for therapists so we’ll see."
Best basic signs to learn for deaf roommate?,10,deaf,"Hey a bit outside of topic, what’s the benefit of someone with mental health related issues living in a disability residence. I’m curious and want to educate myself a bit more"
Deaf peer helper around the world,7,deaf,"Yes I do understand that's how it is all over the world. There is absolutely no tendency to include all deaf people under one umbrella here. If anything, I see a lot of Deaf (I play deaf sports so I know a lot of Deaf people) vehemently against HAs and CIs because somehow they are threatened by them. A Deaf friend once told me he did not 'let' his wife go for HAs because... Anyway that's how it is here and I feel uncomfortable about people advocating on whether one should get CIs or not, unless they are ENTs.

On the livelihood part - the government does a lot actually. We have so many schemes that let's someone take loans for bare minimum interest to set up their own businesses. We don't have anything for housing though.

Mental health in general is not taken seriously here :) we all just wing it or get married and have babies. So I don't think the government does anything for it. 

Private organisations on the other hand does have a few things in place. But they are only for their own employees.

For most companies based out of India, making the workplace inclusive is all about making it inclusive as long as it doesn't cost them anything extra."
Husband going deaf,11,deaf,"ASL classes are definitely a good move, not only will he learn a new way to communicate but he will also meet fellow deaf/HoH people. One thing that tends to worsen mental health in late-deafened people is isolation, so getting out of the house and interacting with people on a regular basis can make a difference.
I started losing my hearing in high school and I am now 35 with severe hearing loss in my right ear and profound hearing loss in my left ear, coming to terms with having to live life without one of your senses is a big adjustement but it's nothing that can't be overcome with patience and support, and as it seems your husband is lucky enough to have a supportive spouse.
As far as other resources are concerned, I would recommend downloading LiveTranscribe apps and maybe Lingvano (which is Duolingo but for ASL) in order to start with signing before he starts studying the language in depth during his classes.

Good luck to both of you."
How to cope with a difficult job while being Deaf,5,deaf,"Does your job or insurance offer counseling, Employee Assistance Program, or mental health services? I would reach out to them for assistance.
I don't mean to disregard your desires here. But if staying there is causing so many issues, I would rather walk away with my mental health intact, than to suffer just to ""win"". Stress and other impacts can lead to lifelong issues.

I've had two cases go through the EEOC, and both times the final determination was that no discrimination happened (even though there was lots of documentation). I don't know the specifics of your situation, but I know I held on for much longer than I should have. If I could go back, I would have walked away much earlier. I'm in a much better place now.

Quitting will be YOUR decision that they have no control over."
Do mental hospitals allow hearing aids/BAHAs,24,deaf,"I did a bout of inpatient in high school, and I still wore hearing aids at that age. I can confirm that they WILL let you keep them. It's medically necessary both for your physical AND mental health. Taking it from you would only add more anguish to the situation, which would not even be conducive to helping you in a critical moment like this."
Mental Health Question,7,deaf,Maybe talk with Deaf Wellness Center.  It's in Rochester and they have Deaf therapists and resources for mental health for deaf people.
rant about this community,61,deaf,"I'm so sorry you received so much negative energy.  I missed your first post, so I'm not up to speed. 

It sounds like you need immediate help in the workplace.  A CI isn't going to be immediate help.  But CART can be!!!

I had a similar experience in college and I dropped out because of it.  Years later, I decided to take a chance and the school disability office introduced me to CART. It changed my life.  I honestly never world have made it through college (let alone been on the Dean's list or getting a graduate degree)  if it hasn't been for this.

 CART is basically someone typing out every single word that is being said during trainings. And the best part is that you don't have to worry about taking notes! The whole transcript is emailed to you afterwards.  This allows you to focus solely on listening instead of taking notes but if you miss hearing a word, you just look at the computer screen, and you are all caught up.  Your brain can focus on what it is leaning rather than focus on understanding words.  

This is considered a reasonable accommodation under the ADA in America.  Your company's cannot argue about trade secrets or anything to refuse providing this. 

This may be something you use your whole life or out may be something to help bridge the gap between now and when you have adapted to your CI (which can take months and exhausts you).

Now that being said.  I had my CI surgery on my 30s. I love it but there are still some downsides.  Group conversations and nose encircled are easier but it's not perfect.  In many ways, you'll still rely on old habits because they are so ingrained.   Getting my CI did make me more comfortable and accepting of being deaf. It helped me advocate for myself, and it made coworkers really understand just how deaf I am.  I became more confident in demanding others do their share of the communication burden.   That may or may not be what happens for you.  I still use oral speech as my primary communication tool.  A CI is a tool to help you reach your goals. Nobody can tell you what your communicating goals are and who you have to be.
* Are you able to get a CART service at your college if you are still in college? The CART service made a huge difference on my end. I always had ASL interpreters in my college classes, but it did not help me because I had to focus on the interpreters. I didn't have time to translate from ASL to English. So, I couldn't write down any notes at all. The CART service exceeded my note taking needs. 
* Please let your professor know the benefits of wearing a microphone / transmitter. Hopefully, he will change his mind. 
* As for the internship, were you able to get your retraining at this time with your accommodation needs being fulfilled? How long are you staying at this internship? Are you getting paid at this internship? 
   * If yes, you are entitled to reasonable accommodations at internships and jobs in order to thrive in this workplace. There is no way for employers to decline your reasonable accommodations. Please don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. 
      * Please make a list of your reasonable accommodations in a professional manner and email the HR department (copy this email to your personal email address too). Work email addresses can be deleted permanently. So, you could have enough paper trails for future lawsuits, in case they turn down your reasonable accommodations. 
* Getting CIs is up to you. It's all about you. It's your decision. It will be part of your life permanently. You just need to ensure that you will not have any regrets in the end. I'm Deaf and ineligible for getting CIs. I have a couple of friends who have CIs. They say both good and bad things about having the CIs. 
   * Cons 
      * CIs giving static background (They can be corrected by your audiologist specialized in CIs) 
      * Hearing fatigue (You can just release your transmitter from your head whenever you take a break) 
      * CIs failed, they were not functioning at all (You can just see your audiologist to fix this issue. If your audiologist recommends removing CIs, you would spend money again for the surgery) 
      * Insurance might not cover the CI costs (Keep looking for different insurances until you find one) 
   * Pros
      * Able to hear sounds that you never heard when you wore hearing aids
      * Able to listen to music if you are a big fan of music (connect via bluetooth)
      * Able to swim with CIs (Hearing aids don't work in water if it stays submerged too long)
      * Able to hear your voice better when you speak. Adjust your voice.

When you turn off your CIs, you are still deaf, right? I treat CIs as one of the most effective communication tools for people with hearing loss. 

I wish all the best to you!"
How do I deal with loosing my hearing?,11,deaf,"Hey op the other comment left here is super negative and I’m sorry that person feels that way but it is not the outlook that you also have to have if you don’t want to. Totally normal and okay to have a lot of big and negative emotions about your hearing but it doesn’t have to be so black and white like the other comment made it seem. I’m not going to say suddenly losing your hearing at a young age is easy. I suddenly lost a good chunk in one ear when I was 8 and it has progressed slowly until that ear has lost all hearing, im now 22. There are things that I face due to my deafness sometimes that will make me sad but over time those have become less as I’ve learned about how to accomodate and the things I can’t do anything about I’m getting better at just accepting. Because not everyone can do everything, we all have limitations that we have to accept. And having a good support system is helpful because a good support system is the type to learn sign language with you or find other ways to still communicate with you as you lose hearing, they don’t allow you to just get completely left out. Having a good support system means having people that may not understand but that you can vent to, and connecting to your local deaf community can give you both of those things. Having a good support system means having one that believes you when you say you didn’t hear them and makes adjustments to help you. I think it may be easy for some to say that a good support system does nothing because they’ve never had a bad one and don’t know how much that would have worsened their situation. It’s more common than not for families to not even attempt to learn sign language for their deaf family member. It’s also super common for deaf kids to have been told they were faking and not received any accommodation as a result. People who have healthy support systems are lucky even if they don’t realize it. Eta: obviously based on what you shared you are experiencing both. Your parents aren’t being the best support system currently and are adding to your feelings. Have you tried talking to them directly about it though? Maybe things are being misinterpreted or maybe they need to be talked to to even understand the struggles that come with losing your hearing. And you also have your good support system that’s there for you but you struggle to depend on. Also normal. The more you can accommodate yourself the better it often is for your mental health and it’s also good to remind yourself that everyone needs help with things sometimes. 

I’m not going to pretend being deaf isn’t a disability though. It does disable you from interacting with the world without at least some accommodation. That does make life hard. I’m not downplaying that. I’m just saying that it doesn’t have to be the end of your life being happy or good. Life can still be beautiful and happy without your hearing. It’s of course a big adjustment and doesn’t feel fair and it’s normal for it to be a lot to process but it’s possible to make the adjustment and live a good life. It’s normal to have anxiety or even panic at the loss of a sense and it’s possible to work through the emotions and find comfort in your other senses.
I'm 57.  I've been HoH since I was 7 years old and wearing hearing aids.  I'm profoundly deaf now as speech comprehension is greatly diminished and retired.  

First of all, don't beat yourself up.  It's not your fault.  You aren't a liability.  

I can relate to your anxiety of losing your hearing.  It's frightening and you feel very alone.  
Believe me, things will get better.  A lot better.  It helps to have local support and I would  
encourage you to attempt to make friends with others who are HoH / deaf.  

If you have an iPhone, I use Group Transcribe that turns speech to text.  It's quite useful  
in noisy environments where hearing aids are pretty much useless.  It's very good at  
picking up conversations.

Also keep your mental health in check.  Depression will over-take you if you wallow in  
your despair.  I had to start taking anti-depressants once I went profoundly deaf and  
had to quit my career that I loved.  It's important to keep those dark thoughts away.  
Don't give up.  

My hearing aids are bluetooth and I can stream all phone calls and music directly into  
my hearing aid.  This alone has been a life saver for me.  Also, if you want to feel the   
music -- look into SkullCandy's Crusher EVO headset.  It has haptics so there's no   
damage to your ears, but the bass will rattle your skull and you'll love it.  

Yeah, it sucks, but you'll be fine.  Lots of people out there with some type of disability,  
so you're not alone.  The advancements in finding a cure for deafness is improving, so  
keep your fingers crossed.

Stay strong.
are you able to wear the headphones over your hearing aids??? the haptics alone sound interesting so i definitely would love to give them a try.

I agree with keeping your mental health in check.. for years I could get by normally with my limited hearing until the day came where i couldn't. When you realize you can't go about your life the same as you once did, it's a hard adjustment.

**OP, keep your head up and make peace with this new normal. Lean on this community and know that you're not alone.** I'm sorry about your parents, just chuck it up to ignorance. They can't comprehend your experience without having lived it. Just focus on looking forward. It takes time for your brain to adjust to all the sound coming from your hearing aid, but if you feel that some things are too loud that's definitely worth talking to your audiologist about, they can adjust everything to a reasonable level. Once you start feeling comfortable with your hearing aids, concerts shouldn't be an issue although I'd think about getting some hearing protection of some kind (i read eargasm is a good brand for that)."
Advice needed - is being exhausted from listening normal?,52,deaf,"It really is. A lot of people don’t realize how much work it takes just to seem “normal” in the hearing world without an interpreter or communication accessibility.

This situation happens nearly every time I go out: Hearing person starts talking, I quickly interrupt and let them know that I’m deaf and can read their lips. They either start yelling at me because they think louder means comprehension (when it just messes up lip movement and makes it even harder to read them), or they give me a pity party: “I’m so sorry…”

I deal with it by basically staying within my circle of family and friends that I can communicate with via sign. I’ve turned down a lot of invites to go clubbing, parties, any social event if there will be more than two or three hearing people due to how exhausting it gets to follow the conversation.

You’ll just stress yourself out if you keep dwelling on how it makes you feel. Find an outlet that allows you to feel included and involved, not as easy to do as it is to type that, but that’s a method that’s helped me a lot.

I’ve been Deaf for 40 years now, and I’m still finding stuff out on how to deal with situations or people and how it affects my mental health. If it’s causing you that much emotional turmoil, then I would recommend going to a therapist/counselor to vent to so you aren’t carrying that burden around all the time."
Anyone want a friend to video chat with?,5,deaf,"Hi! I am in my early 30s and a mental health counseling grad student. I would be open to video chatting if we have some interests or things to talk about in common :) 

Also, there are still some active ASL Zoom Chats out there. The nice thing about Zoom is that you can join ASL Chats hosted by ppl in other states."
"Are Deaf people supposed to just... not have mental health issues? (half vent, half ""please help me"")",40,deaf,"Yeah, see, THAT to me, is the greater problem. You NEED a GREAT internet connection. Is there any way to access better Internet? 
 It would be impossible for me to survive without the internet. With the internet, it doesn't matter if I'm Deaf, and it doesn't matter if the other party is hearing and speaks. Google Live Captioning is a GAME CHANGER and has transformed my life. I cannot tell you enough how wonderful it's been for me, also a long time consumer of mental health services. Through Google Love Captioning I'm able to participate in tele-health AND Group therapy as well as a hearing prison, and better than I could IRL and F2F, this includes twelve step groups, as well."
Does anybody know how I can find a therapist that I can communicate with?,21,deaf,"Definitely talk to your deaf services agency.  In my state,  we have a particular mental health group that is contracted for all Deaf mental health services in the state.  But you may not see that of you just search for asl therapists.  

If you go the VRI route,  you'll need to ask about licensing in your state and if insurance will cover it."
"The older I get, the more I realize Hearing people are the ones disabled and not the Deaf people.",0,deaf,"I agree with your usage of the German word behinderung, ""being obstacled (sic)"". However, you are directing it in the wrong direction. Hearing people are the one suffering from behinderung, that is, via creating policies, procedures, laws, medical models, and many other environmental harms that causes normal Deaf children to become literally cognitively and/or psychologically disabled from linguistic deprivation and/or educational deprivations. 

Don't believe me? Here is a simple snapshot of a disabling world Hearing people created against the Deaf people: 

Google Scholar - [Deaf mental health language deprivation](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C24&q=deaf+mental+health+language+deprivation&oq=Deaf+linguistic+deprivation) 

It is the Hearing populations failure to understand the world in a proper way that causes no harm that makes them disabled and we need to assist them with their disability. One way is by creating threads like this to address it, especially addressing misconceptions such as yours. 

Example: 

1. If Hearing people get bored because of no sounds while driving, then they have been taught poorly on how to drive properly and how to keep themselves properly simulated via environmentally appropriate coping skills that doesn't rely on sounds. That's not the Deaf people's fault but solely on the shoulders of the Hearing world. Even ASL interpreters (mostly CODAs) agrees with this perspective, thus adding weights that even a Hearing person can correct the problems by using Deaf visual solutions. 
2. ""Bigger screens"" = more problems? It actually led to less problems because the screen is big enough to quickly glance at it to grab more information before looking back on the road. The smaller screens were causing a lot of problems, hence the change to bigger screens. Do your research first before making strange claims. 
3. Do you know why I ""generalized""? Because I cannot write a whole thesis on a Reddit page. I expect educated people to understand why I generalized by being able to extrapolate prior point of views and use creative thinking and abstract reasoning abilities to obtain new thoughts and ideas. If you had to accuse me of generalized statements, that only goes to prove that you cannot broaden your own horizon by your own efforts, thus defending your own status quo by making accusations towards people like me who CAN create those kinds of broad ways of thinking. 
4. In fact, here is an example of being able to extrapolate. Is the fact that you socialize with people that can think on a broader horizon because you're unable to do it on your own and need to depend on others to do it for you? 

Those are simply food for thoughts. I can easily serve a whole meal course full of scholar information but I don't want to do the dirty work for lazy people, regardless on if they're Deaf or Hearing."
Hearing therapist who wants to provide services to deaf people,2,deaf,"Yes Deaf Community need more mental health therpaist, first of all if you dont know sign language start taking classes you will need to be fluent in sign language first before you can provide your service to Deaf Community otherwise the therpay processing wouldnt be effective. It would be more effective if you are fluent in Sign Language. Not just Sign language you need to be also very familiar and understand Deaf Culture too
Not in the US but yes we took my daughter to a play therapist who knew BSL. I think everyone should have proper access to mental health services."
tips on improving accessibility and inclusion,6,deaf,"If this hasn’t happened already, I would suggest training for everyone on Language Deprivation and its effects on mental and physical health in the Deaf community. Our local deaf mental health  institution contacts me and others in my circle several times a year asking for advice in working with their clients who have “low language competence”. I would also suggest having ASL fluent staff (preferably Deaf) who specialize in working with clients who are Language Deprived."
Question about mental health support for the deaf community,10,deaf,signed by stories on youtube has videos of deaf people sharing their mental health experiences. would recommend checking it out to gain some perspective
Mental health counseling student looking to improve counseling services for Deaf/ HOH Clients,10,deaf,"My experience is rather limited, as I intended to start therapy again right before pandemic hit, and my experience are from the times I was severely depressed, so it didn't really cover a lot of my life.

But... what I can say is that I have noticed that not only professionals aren't aware (or understand) the Deaf cultura, they also aren't aware of how much society can be ableist and how that can compound with other mental health issues and identities, as well, not understanding how capitalism is extremely oppressive and problematic for disabled people (not only deaf/Deaf/HoH), or even how society can teach us a lot of subtle messages in ways that a non disabled person doesn't even realize. And of course, they tend to not be aware of any disability history.

Many professionals are like ""oh yeah, but that doesn't really have any relation to..."", being extremely dismissive, as if we can just turn off our disability in our daily life and not be affected by it or as if our disability is just a minor detail that can't be connected to everything or anything at all.

I remember when I started looking for psychologist, one of my criteria was understanding how my HoH identity can tangle with other identities (such as being queer and non binary, as well asexual) and struggles and possible mental health diagnosis. For example, I have a couple of suspicions that I might be on the spectrum, however, when doing some tests, a lot of it feels familiar, but I don't know if those experience and feelings can be 100% due to my hearing loss (and all the consequences plus a lot of how society treat me) or if it's a mixed bag and so on. (Not sure if that made sense, let me know and I'll try to find a better way to explain, as English isn't my native language).

And to be honest, I didn't get far with that criteria. It's easy to find professionals that can understand how racism is deeply tangled with other stuff or even how LGBT+ identities can be tangled with other stuff, but it's extremely rare to find someone with minimal knowledge of not only the culture, but as well the disability history, and all the subtleties of the disabled/Deaf/deaf/HoH identity.

Recently, at an event, I ran into a friend's sister who is a psychologist, and one word lead to another, I mentioned that I have never felt as the main character of my own story, due to how I grew up, lack of representation, lack of understanding, as well how society teaches us that we aren't worth of affection, love, but instead, disaffection, disgust and so on, and the face of realization she had was a massive one, and even said something along the lines of ""That is so mind-blowing, I'm surprised that in no moment of my education or even afterwards, I never once stopped to think that treating patients that are disabled or Deaf/deaf/HoH is as complex as treating that are Black, queer/LGBT+, women and so on."" She wasn't aware of how deep the issues can run in the disabled community.
I'd suggest polling around NTID if you can, the mental health resources at the university sucked in more ways than one so you may get some good answers there.
Ugh that's unfortunate to read. I would have expected NTID to have mental health resources specifically geared towards supporting their students. Thank you for the comment, and suggestion I will definitely check it out!
It's more that the mental health resources suck campus wide, not just for NTID. Lot of mediocre to bad counselors from the experience of my group."
Have a hard time learning sign due to my other mental disabilities,18,deaf,"You got this! Honestly I was the same way. I used to be at the top of my class and then my mental health took a sharp decline and I was never the same again. I'm still grateful I can learn though, it just takes longer than other people sometimes"
I hate being deaf,81,deaf,The DMV? I would not have guessed that would be a deaf friendly workplace..
Psychiatrist question,0,deaf,"If you want to work in mental health in the Deaf community, I cannot recommend Dr. Neil Glickman and Dr. Sanjay Gulati highly enough. Dr. Glickman is a psychologist and is hearing but has signed for decades. Still, he uses a Deaf interpreter (CDI) when necessary, and he is experienced enough to know when he needs one. The same goes for Dr. Gulati, except that he is a psychiatrist and he is Deaf himself. He has made it his life's mission to get Language Deprivation Syndrome added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. I hope he can, it needs to be there. Search these names and read these articles and watch these videos, and it will give you an idea of what's going on. There are others as well. One name will lead to another, they often work together. I will tell you that this is a unique subfield, and it can get very complex. This is because psychology and psychiatry and just therapy and mental health in general is the most linguistic experience a person can ever have, probably. And many of the patients have been victims of a society that does not recognize or promote their language in its natural form, something the rest of the world doesn't have to worry about. Most therapists, for example, have never encountered someone who can't readily converse with their own parent or sibling or colleague, for example. The average practitioner doesn't know the first thing about this community. It's not their fault, it's just the way it is. But I'm glad to see when people want to learn more. The doctors I have recommended use American Sign Language, used in the United States and most parts of Canada. I am not familiar with such practitioners in other countries. However, I'm sure they exist."
Masks are back indoors everywhere in California again,30,deaf,"I do too, but I moved to San Diego because the rain in Portland made me depressed and suicidal for half the year. My family is in Georgia, but being a gay man I absolutely refuse to live in the south again. There are other options that are sunny, but they don’t have the beach. Legally you are allowed to pull your mask down to communicate with a HOH or deaf person, but it just isn’t happening at my workplace, at least for me, I’m not sure about customers as I generally work the bar. You’re right this is a very divided issue and I’m not really advocating for no masks anywhere. I just can’t stomach the idea of working for $20 an hour or less. Fortunately there is an end date to this, as someone told me in this thread. So that is a very big relief."
Would it be okay for a hearing person to access a crisis line with vrs or something similar?,5,deaf,"I work for a call relay center and strongly agree with u/surdophobe 's comment. The appropriate call type for you OP, is HCO through the TRS (text-based relay service) not ASL with a videophone through VRS. HCO is designed to be used by any people who are able to hear over the phone but for whatever reason are unable to speak. Some common examples of people who use this service are autistic individuals and people with selective mutism but a mental health situation resulting in inability to speak would certainly qualify as well. I have the contact number and email for the relay service and I will DM you with those details.
I would recommend you use a TTY or text relay service as these are used by both DdHH people and those with speech difficulties or who are non/semi verbal (I fit both categories and it works well for me, especially since I'm not fluent in my country's sign language and English is easier to communicate with).

I don't know if this is available in the US (I think it's available in some places?), but over here you can register to text emergency services which could also be helpful when there is a crisis and you cannot talk or find it difficult. After the quick registration, you can text them from your phone.

There's also a text crisis service called SHOUT here which is the same as a mental health crisis helpline but in text messages and it works fine for me. Maybe there's a similar thing in the US.

These services are not exclusive to DdHH people afaik, I've never used VRS due to my lack of efficiency in my country's sign language. They are useful to have and free."
is it possible to not admit or struggle with deaf identity?,21,deaf,"It's called different things because it manifests in different ways, but basically yes - it can be hard to feel like you identify with a group that you've had so little contact with.  You've been mostly muddling by through making yourself fit in with your hearing peers because that was your source of social interaction etc.  Now that you're getting older that's not quite working and your social worker's noticed something in your interactions. 

Honestly it's not a bad thing to go talk to a psychiatrist or counselor.  Mental health is important and it looks so different for different people.  It's not like they're going to immediately say you need medication or you're weird, or you're going to get thrown into 24/7 mental unit or whatever.  It's just to help you sort things out in a safe, educated way.
It's hard to admit to oneself that you have a disability. At most, you want to look at it as an inconvenience or annoyance that you can just cope with. Because, for it to be a real thing, feels like an admission of weakness.

And also, a lot of people just don't know what to do about their deafness. They just think they're broken. And it's easy to get stuck in that rut.

Sometimes you need someone else to help you see past the immediate problems and find whatever the right path forward is. Deafness can be a big barrier, and a lot of people need help knowing what to do next.

So, definitely recommend therapy for anyone who struggles (hearing related or not). A mental health pro can be the level-headed person that helps you get through your emotions to get through whatever's blocking you from living your life."
Just a vent over feeling curtailed professionally,6,deaf,"Thank you for your feedback and thoughtful response! It meant a lot to have someone respond. You bring up a good point in recognizing the long term. 

I guess I feel a juxtaposition for my preference to work pretty independently (without a huge dependence on captions) with a desire to work on more complex assignments that seem to only be available in a teamwork setting. It seems like it would be best to go after opportunities that do not challenge me to interact with people in a way that I either can't or don't have the patience for right now even if it cost me opportunities that are not the right fit.  

I've had the CI checked, there isn't really anything they can do. :( 

To be honest, I think I was looking for a few people to say ""Yeah, captioning (while helpful) doesn't put me on even footing with hearing people within leadership roles"" to help feel better about my choice to not take on the that kind of challenge. I don't think it worked, but maybe that is good thing, that means that some people here really did find the right fit of accommodations to thrive in their workplaces and my expectations are either too high and/or I haven't found the right fit. 

Thank you for writing!"
Relationship advice: deaf husband/hearing wife wanting more efficient communication,56,deaf,"I’m deaf, my husband is hearing. I’m glad you’re being proactive learning ASL. The largest struggle for me was having to adapt all my life in a hearing world. My parents were told not to teach me ASL because I wouldn’t be successful. Well this led to years of isolation. Family gatherings I play on my phone as well because people tend to get awkward when I ask them to repeat themselves. They also like to tease I responded incorrectly from mishearing info or I am just plain exhausted trying to keep up in groups or background noise. I’m fine playing on my phone, I find it relaxing, I also need it to decompress. For some reason there’s always someone that finds it rude but hey, my mental health and being is more important than a little social gathering. 
Learning ASL after so long feels so unnatural, it’s difficult. Using ASL, the sentence structure is different form verbal so I find that challenging as well. It’s also discouraging going in person. It ends up feeling like an all day event just to learn a bit of ASL. However, when I took ASL online, at my own pace. I enjoyed learning. Gallaudet offers free courses online. See if he will start there. Then I highly recommend taking the the ASL and Deaf Studies certification. Again, the online and convenience of it I think will help.

"Apparently, finding interpreters is impossible.",86,deaf,"This is absolutely unacceptable.  I am an interpreter, and I have worked in mental health settings in a supervisory capacity (not as an interpreter).  About 30% of our residents were deaf.  There was an interpreter at EVERY junction of the residents’ mental health therapy and care, AND the faculty and staff (including me, a supervisor) could sign.  A facility like the one I worked at is not the norm, but it certainly exists. Where are you in the states? Also, look into remote interpreting if there are genuinely no interpreters in your area (unlikely, and not optimal, I know).   Yeah, technically a private facility can just say no.  But there are private places that will be accommodating, as well as publicly run options.
I'm truly sorry about what you're going through. It's bullshit. 

My wife is a deaf therapist, and we live in a deaf mecca (Rochester, NY) and she's very frustrated with the mental health system here. There is a serious lack of residential treatment facilities that can accommodate deaf patients. It's even worse for difficult patients, because they typically get kicked out of RTF's due to serious behavioral issues. And that basically means they have absolutely nowhere left to go.

If it's that bad here, then it's likely much worse everywhere else. Hearing people basically don't give a damn when it comes to mental health services for the deaf, and deaf therapists have difficulty trying to push this issue through the hearing-centric system. 

Funding for deaf mental health services also is a joke. Everything is run on shoestring budget."
How do you find a mental health therapist?,38,deaf,"If you're near Queens, NY, you should call the Lexington Center. They have mental health specialists that serve the Deaf community. Good luck to you both!
HEY!

This is the NJ website for deaf/hoh. If you scroll down there is a line for mental health. 


Even if that's not perfect, they can point you to good services."
Interview for Psychology Graduate School Project,5,deaf,I think that this is a great choice! Access to mental health resources and services is a definite issue in the Deaf Community. I would be happy to participate in this project.
