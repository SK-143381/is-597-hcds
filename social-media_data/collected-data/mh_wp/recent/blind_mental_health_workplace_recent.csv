Neighbour making my home unsafe for my guide dog. Not sure what’s for the best.,20,Blind,Oh he sounds delightful! Not! 🙄 Some people are just so inconsiderate. To some extent it doesn't matter how minor the behaviour is if it's frequent enough then it can still have a huge impact on someone's mental health. Hopefully we can have a nice peaceful future!
Need some advice on working,7,Blind,I was in a program for clinical mental health counseling. Good luck on the job search and agreed on the online program difficulties.
My father has done next to nothing for the past two years,1,Blind,"So to start with, I am 54 and became legally blind two years ago. So much of this resonates with me. I am not at all trying to judge your father because this is brutal and I get how he feels.

This all sounds like a form of depression that is very familiar to me, and if a few things were different in my case I could definitely imagine myself getting into the same kind of state. There is a brutal downward spiral effect that just sucked every ounce of willpower and determination out of me on so many days, and whenever it went on for more a day it would get rapidly worse. If things had gone a little differently for me, I could see those days turning into weeks and then months. It is entirely possible that your dad needs mental health professionals helping him at this point, because it just can get that bad. You all might need to get together for a little intervention to get him to seek this help. My prediction would be that he won’t do it independently at this point and will probably be very resistant to the idea. Hopefully you can all come together and show him that you are truly with him and want him to have help.

I went through something similar very recently with another family member who needed that kind of help, and it was not fun. This is going to suck. But from my own experience with these feelings and from what you’re describing, this is probably something that he needs you to do for him.

Now, there is a whole other aspect to this that is also worth investigating, because it sounds like your father needs to cultivate some blind life skills that will help him regain his independence and self identity that he so badly needs right now. I believe that at a certain level of visual impairment you need to develop blind skills or spend the rest of your life thinking everything is closed off to you. I have pretty good acuity for a legally blind person but enough problems to make me have to do almost everything the blind way, as much as possible, so that I can use my little bit of vision for the things it is still good for. I can’t read long text, get very little out of screens and can’t do any fine work visually. I have to use screen readers for everything tech-related and other assistive tech and alternative techniques for everything else. Using these tools is what helps me keep working, keep paying bills, be on the Web and every kind of self fulfillment. Without them I would probably be in exactly the same place as your dad. So, is he using any assistive tech and learning blind life skills? Has he had any kind of assistance from vocational rehab? BESB? Is he using a cane or screen readers?

My guess would be that he is a bit resistant to these things and is trying to do everything like he would as a fully sighted person, which is probably really holding him back. A lot of people our age would try to deny how visually impaired they really are and stay away from all the assistive tech that could free them. This is something that talking to other low vision people could help with, as I’m pretty sure the results are fairly self evident. You just can’t be successful at life as a blind person if you keep on denying that you’re blind.

(I am doing a lot of guessing at he state of his vision here, but even if he is not legally blind he may have enough of a visual impairment that a lot of these things could help him. Canes, for example, aren’t only for the blind. There are quite a few people who are not legally blind but can still benefit from using a cane in situations that require it.)

I think this is a very hard road ahead for all of you, but he needs to get out of that spiral before it’s too late. Please get him talking to other B/VI people and/or mental health professionals. I am happy to talk to any of you in DMs if it will help, but what I really think would help most is real life contact, not a random weirdo on Reddit. (This is also a guess, but I’m guessing that if he was inclined to look for support from Reddit he would already be here.)
Thank you. Your response was very thorough and your assumptions were accurate. I think we do need to bring the focus back to mental health, community and therapy. My step mom is very passive and avoidant when it comes to hard conversations - so I know the  responsibility for dealing with this will be placed on my shoulders. He thinks he is beyond therapy. Have I mentioned I am a therapist? Lol. I do not attempt to do work on my family, way too exhausting. 

He also is very resistant to using technology. I have mentioned screen readers before and he mentions how embarrassing that would be (but shoving your face into your phone to read a text is not? Lol) 
He is just resistant to all of it. We downloaded a magnifying glass app to help him read menus at restaurants and he was telling my husband how embarrassed he is to use it - even though, in reality, no one is paying attention"
"Looking for support, been visually impaired & a braille reader all my life, used to have some usable sight, lost everything several years ago and still struggling with living in total darkness.",13,Blind,"I was lucky enough to find a great mental health counselor that helped me reinforce using my tools to cope wit vision loss, have you ever tried it?"
Looking for genuine friends and a support system,23,Blind,"Have you already checked out the r/blind Discord?

Mental health, I'd say, is a struggle for all of us who had vision and lost it. I know my first year, maybe two years was the lowest point I had after almost a decade of becoming healthier, mentally and emotionally.

I lucked out a bit and found a Reddit stranger that helped me through it. Hope that you find one too and you're welcome to reach out over PM. I don't use Reddit chat because it lacks notifications on the browser so I may go days before realizing there are waiting chats."
Respectful boundary communication with a blind person,32,Blind,"No cheating. Sex is off the table. I think his partner has mental health issues and that is probably the reason.

He had recently completed training with an Orientation and Mobility trainer but he grew up in a wealthier family and I think he is a bit used to people being at his service. I do not intend on doing that.
I understand the feeling of not wanting to be a burden but the world is changing and a lot of people are trying to learn to be more understanding and supportive of people with disabilities. I see this in academia and at the workplace and also among discussions with friends. For me, if I am hanging out with a blind person at a restaurant I don't mind helping get to the sit, reading you the menu (I actually like discussing the menu), walking you to the restroom or getting a glass of water for you. Those are simple things that are more or less basic needs."
Accessing mental health care specifically related to my vision impairment (located in US),9,Blind,"Honestly I would say seeking out other blind and visually impaired people is way better than therapy from a pretty much guaranteed to be sighted therapist with no real idea what you're going through. And if you've already experienced abuse from the mental health sector, it's not worth rolling the dice on dealing with that again. I personally won't ever be going back to any therapy after the abuse that led to medically induced brain damage. 

Finding other blind folks to talk with, even just online, is so helpful. If you can get in touch with anyone from the National Federation of the Blind or read some of their literature on the power of blind people and our communities, I highly recommend it. There's lots of folks to talk to on the Our Blind Discord server as well.
Find your state's disability advocate/employment aid and discuss your mental health needs with them.

As an example, in Texas, it's known as Texas Workforce. My aide/advocate helped me get recommended into the Austin center's waiting list. There have been some disappointments with loss of communication and missed messages regarding O&M and tech, but that's been on me.

She did help me find a local support group of visually impaired folk to talk about troubles and generally bitch when things like power outages happen or the mute Domino's driver tries to wave a piza in my face so I'll take it...
Yeah- there are certainly lots of great blind/visually impaired folks in the community, and also, there are lots of great therapists. I have low vision and a sighted therapist and we spend probably 75% of our time over the last several years discussing vision-related stuff. I’ve also experienced plenty of issues with medical providers over the years and have my share of trust issues, but blanket statement bad mental health care isn’t a cause or a result. OP, if therapy is a good fit for your needs, good therapists exist."
New glasses!,15,Blind,"Thank you, I've spent all day stressing about going out tonight and what it might mean for my future. I'm not so worried about me but about other peoples reactions. I've had drs blame some very obvious problems on my mental health before like I was told my continence issues were unrelated to the organ falling outside my body. I'm worrying this will be another thing they choose to build into something it's not. I'm doing all this while at the same time knowing that it might not even be an issue, maybe these glasses have done the trick. But hopefully by the time I tuck myself into bed tonight I'll have the experience/information I need to decide what I need to do going forward. I just want to feel safe and have a reference point of where I am being that a sliver of curb or a drain cover catching the light or that be a cane telling me where the edge of the path is. In myself I don't really care as long as I can still go out when I need to. It's the worrying about other people that's getting to me at this stage."
"Career prospects for visually impaired, young stroke survivor ",8,Blind,"Oh, [Access To Work](https://phw.nhs.wales/services-and-teams/healthy-working-wales/workplace-guidance/employees-with-health-needs/musculoskeletal-health/guidance-and-resources-for-employers/access-to-work/#:~:text=Access%20to%20Work%20can%20help,practical%20support%20with%20your%20work) will probably pay for a screenreader like JAWS at the very least. I think you have to apply for it rather than your employer but they’ll suggest accessibility related tools and provide the money for it. Sorry if you have already gone down this route."
Anyone in here with ADHD or autism?,7,Blind,"I have diagnosed ADHD and dyslexia.    

We can make a discord channel under r/blind discord for mental health if you like.  Let me know.
Thank you so much for your feedback. I was diagnosed last year at the age of 36. So I know the feeling. 

I think you are on to something about the techniques working for blind people also benefit ADHD. Before getting my diagnosis, I spent a lot of time reorganizing my kitchen. Basically, made sure everything was within reach and in a good place. I bought kitchen equipment that was easy, fast and fun to use (air fryers and multi cookers) and it helped change my eating habits. 

I later realized that I was creating a very ADHD friendly kitchen too! I need to think carefully about how I can take that concept to the rest of my house (and workplace)"
Looking for a job,3,Blind,"first of all, are you here in the United States; if so, I might know a job that you could do from home, that does not take up a lot of time, and would be I believe a perfect fit for you. I work at this company, myself, and I know the ins and outs as to what is going on with the campaign that I’m working. And everyone here where I work are either low vision, or Blind. And we have a very very good community of people who help each other and are aware of each other’s needs in assistive technology, throughout the workplace. If you are very interested in this, please send me a private message and I can tell you more about it."
How is your mental health?,24,Blind,"I was born blind, premature by a number of months. The oxygen needed to keep my brain going was fatal to my retinas, and so I have had no useful vision all my life.

I was very lucky apart from that, though. Despite an apathetic set of parents who didn’t care to get involved with any blind adaptations or organisations and indeed who made it quite clear they didn’t intend to have me and it was my younger, sighted siblings who were the wanted children, I thrived as a child. I was well-supported in education, I made friends. Yes, I became one of the nerds, but the nerds were a group of their own. I didn’t need respect from the whole student body, I was used to not having it from my own parents, after all. I found my niche and settled in, and learning became my thing, backed by technology.

For a decade and a half, this worked well. I grew. I learned. I found ways of understanding things I couldn’t interpret. Proving the existence of clouds to my satisfaction meant a trip in a hot air balloon, because I couldn’t see them and other empirical tests – like covering the sun with another object – didn’t satisfy me. I was curious, polite, inquisitive and excited by the potentials offered by technology to improve my own lot in life, and happy to use my blindness as a teaching tool for others. It became a true part of me, rather than something apart from me. I embraced it. 

Mental health wasn’t on my RADAR at that point. My own health had never brought up any questions in that regard: I’d fallen out of trees and smashed my head on rocks, sprained things and pulled muscles, but nothing other than the physical. The first time I ever really felt that my blindness was a problem was a day when my sighted friends began to take off on their bikes, leaving me behind. I’d been involved in everything else up to that point, and standing outside school, hearing the tick tick tick of their bicycles fading into the distance was the first time I had a bitter upswelling of envy for those who could do what I couldn’t.

I went home. I dialed up to the online bulletin board systems and Multi-user dungeons I’d played for years and marauded my high-level characters through dangerous areas, the thrill of being good at something I’d worked hard for counterbalancing the emotions dredged up by being abandoned. After I’d cooled down, I realized that, for every trip they took out on their bikes, there’d still be more to the cinema, or shops, or bowling alley, just like all the other times. Cross-country biking was an extra to the things they did, not a replacement for the things we did.

My next real shock came when I moved from school to college. I’d had regular access to a sighted assistant up to this point: I’d not needed it often, particularly as I grew more confident in my own use of technology, and the fact that I was left alone by them much of the time served me well in bonding with my sighted peers. Still, the safety net of them being there, plus their ability to fight for accessible work or to adapt it ready for lessons, was a crutch I didn’t know I needed. The 2 years at college without such a level of support was grueling. Being handed print textbooks at the start of a lesson and told to use them like everyone else was … eye-openingly impossible, and began to make me realise just how ablest the word could be, although that word didn’t really enter my vocabulary at that point.

This pattern was to repeat itself throughout my life. For every one job interview I attended in hope, perhaps five or six people turned me away with legitimate-sounding reasons for not employing me, thinly veiling the fact that the real reason was my blindness. Legally, they couldn’t say it, but as a practical matter, if two people apply for the same job and one requires less adaptations or changes to existing working systems, most of the time, the disabled person loses.

Despite all this, I was resolute in my blind happiness. I’d known no different, after all. Seeing was a concept to me, not a way of life. I would have happily given away physical parts of my eyes to help other people see more clearly if medically feasible.  And then we had a child.

Another pivotal moment came during my child’s toddler days. She was an articulate child – she had to be, pointing at things and making noises didn’t get her anywhere. We walked into a fast-food restaurant during the school holidays. I remember vividly the flood of warm air as we crossed the threshold, the roar of noisy voices, the clangor of diners ordering and eating and playing, kids screaming, parents shouting. And us waiting to be seated in all that, and me knowing intellectually that my daughter was only a few small footsteps away from me yet utterly cut off, aurally, from my senses.   This was the point at which I really began to want vision. Getting on or off the right bus, knowing precisely if I was about to walk into the correct building or room, being assured of my place in line – these had all been things I’d previously struggled with whilst out-and-about with my child, where just a little bit of vision could have helped.  I’d grumbled a little about them internally, but accepted it as part of my life. And this entry into the furor of the restaurant tipped me into thinking that, even the smallest chance of some vision, medically, mechanically, computationally or however, would be something to jump at.

This burning desire has faded as my daughter has grown older. The more I’ve done with her, the more independent I have become and the more ability and understanding she has developed, the need has become less pressing. I was already very happy to use technology to aid me, and that’s only gotten better with time. When we left college as a couple, reading print letters required a flatbed scanner and desktop computer arrangement, taking up half our living room and minutes to read a sheet of paper. Now, I can flip through a handful of letters, point them at the camera poking out of my shirt pocket, and have them sorted by recipient before I’ve finished walking through my house. The ability to read handwriting came next, smashing the barrier of identifying who sent us Christmas cards and bringing a major upswing to my efficiency in the office (yes, my colleagues can now leave handwritten post-it notes on my desk). And just this week, we’ve sent our daughter off on a school trip and I am actually looking forward to the photos she’ll send back from her phone, because of the descriptive abilities of the large language models we now have access to. 

For me, blindness is an inextricable part of who I am. I work in the field of visual impairment. I play adapted sports. I read on a Braille display rather than an eInk kindle, although I am always careful to point out that the source material I read is now the same as everyone else’s, just on a different screen. This is a far cry from my own school days, when putting a book into Braille meant physical, mechanical  labour. Being a computer programmer has undeniably helped me through life – I’ve written dozens of tools for my own edification over the years.  And it is that comfort with and power of technology that I think is my mental life line. I am fortunate beyond my wildest imaginings as a teen. If You’d told my 16-year-old self that he would be able to access handwritten notes at work, or comprehend pictures from holiday snaps, he would have laughed at you. ‘No way’, I’d have said. ‘Blind people can’t access that sort of thing.’

I’d have been right, of course. But things change. And the pace of change has never been greater. And this is what keeps me going. The time I’d spend wallowing in misery would be time I could miss these potential breakthroughs. And so for every little niggle of inaccessibility, for every bump along the road, I think about the road ahead. If I can hop over that bump or smoothen out that wrinkle, what might lie over the horizon?  I could no more have predicted the things I can do now back then than I can predict what access I will have a decade from now. But I do know that, if I persist in living a happy and healthy life, engaged with the blind community, using my technological skills to help other people whilst earning a living and bringing up my child to appreciate that a disability isn’t a lack of ability in other areas, I can cope.

Times are hugely tough right now. My income hasn’t gone up, but the bills have. Just this month the mortgage has jumped up by nearly a third. Electricity, heating and food are also on the rise. None of it is blind related, but all of it impacts how much disposable income we have, and that is blindy – because the money we use on taxis and the extra costs of blindness has become squeezed. I guess we just have to remain careful and cautious, pick our way through the difficulties as best we can. But not lose sight of the fact that seeing is by no means necessary to live a happy, productive life in 2023 in this country, and that is something I am very grateful for.
I'm 41, and My mental health was great until I went totally blind 9 years ago, because as long as I had sight, and even though I only had 10% acuity, there were still things, like playing video-games and coding, that I could still do completely unhindered and where I could feel normal. I also led a fully independent life where my only annoyance was that my employer only let me work from home on Thursdays (this was 15 years before COVID made remote work more prevalent). Then I went blind and had a 5 year long dark period in which all I wanted was to die, and even went through a single psychotic break which ended up with me locked up in a psychiatric hospital for 3 weeks due to being considered a danger to myself. While I never actually tried to kill myself, because I was always afraid of surviving a suicide attempt and ending up with even more disabilities, if there was such a thing as a pill that I could take to end my life I would have taken it back then and would still take it right now. That said these days I try to make the best of the hand that life dealt me, and am eagerly yet patiently waiting for my natural or accidental death, or an opportunity to safely exit life.

What made me recover from the darkest times of my life was the realization that I could still code blind as well as the normalization of my current condition. I can still remember how great life was back then, and would love to return to those days, but for some reason, the more time passes, the more I tend to think of my former sighted days as dreams. Able and healthy people don't even realize how incredibly lucky they are, and to be honest I get a little infuriated with the fact that so many healthy people waste away their lifes with futility instead of investing into self development and into making the world a better place.
I’m 25. A lot of issues have been piling up over the last few weeks that affected my mental health mentally. A lot of these issues come from the visual impairment and I feel a little defeated
I’m 62 and was just recently diagnosed as legally blind. The disease is progressive and there’s nothing to be done. 

I already had mental health challenges. Now I am going through the five stages of grief as I lose my vision. I hate losing my independence. I’m hoping to find group therapy to talk to other people about this.

I’m sorry you’re struggling. I am too.
I’m 23 and recently lost a significant amount of vision due to a illness… My mental health is not good at all currently it happened six months ago and I’m still reeling from it. My life has been completely flipped upside down. I don’t know what to do there’s no resources where I live. I can’t drive anymore. I can’t do anything that I wanted to do or had planned to do with my life because of this and honestly Every day I wish that I never woke up… The only thing keeping me together is my family I guess… But everyone’s getting sick of me complaining and being depressed I’m sure I don’t even know what to do. I really hate it here… A piece of me is still holding out hope that something will change, but another part of me is like I need to be realistic and except this is the life I live… I DK how much longer I’m gonna be here, but I’m gonna hold on until I can’t any longer.
Well, I’d say my mental health is stable now, but I’ve had my ups and downs not only because of my blindness, but also because of my upbringing, and the fact that I have been moving from country to country beginning my teenage years, which has left me with no physical friends, and a bunch of good long-distance friends.  I am definitely successful academically, but the isolation that comes with blindness really sucks. Now  20 years old in college I have managed to come to terms with it by reading a lot and playing video games when accessible. Recently, after a long search, just found a quasi job and will use part of the money that I will be making there to travel around to meet up with my lomg-distance friends to see if I can find life a little more enjoyable lol
Mental health? In this economy?!
Wait you guys have good mental health
Who had a great metaphor bench, pressing mental health"
Dealing with paranoia while blind,14,Blind,"This is a tough one. I've got paranoia in large part because people do watch me when I'm out, they like seeing a blind person doing the thing. I think a big part of managing it is just knowing that you're prone to this kind of thinking and doing what you can within reason to be safe when you go out. Most people are not going to hurt you even if they are watching you, and it can be to your advantage that people are watching because if something does start to happen there are more witnesses to it. Keeping an eye on your mental health for the day is important too. I have days where I know I may not be able to go to some places because I'm just too keyed up. I do a lot of planning ahead too, but that's a general blind life thing; you kinda have to know where you're going and how you're going to get around at that place and then get home."
How To Help My Blind Friend,19,Blind,"Wow, sounds like you're an amazing and thoughtful friend and it's evident you really care about her well-being. With that said, you're exhausted because you're taking on the work of two people, and that's not fair or sustainable. Good for you for recognizing that things need to change so that you can maintain your friendship while making sure that one person isn't carrying the load for all the practical/logistics side of things. 

While some of what you've described does come down to a lack of blindness skills, I think the bigger issue is anxiety and a lack of confidence in her own abilities, so maybe that's the place to start. She knows how to use the machine to pay for things, but gets anxious and asks you to do it. She gets upset and anxious if you ignore her requests for help. She has an app for reading labels, but asks you to do it instead. All of these things are tasks she has demonstrated the capability to do, so it's not really about skill. You can teach her over and over and over again, but if her lack of knowledge isn't the problem, you're getting nowhere and becoming more and more frustrated in the process. 

Some of these things will be beyond your ability to address. While it's great that you're there for emotional support, calming her down and soothing her anxiety all the time is a different thing entirely. Working through this with a mental health professional will help her to get to the root of what's going on in her life and empower her to make changes. It won't be easy, but it will be so worth it. A therapist or other professional can talk through the things she's struggling with emotionally, plus they can determine if there's an imbalance that meds could help with. If nothing else, it can really help to have an outside perspective, because things have been this way for so long that it's difficult for her to even imagine how they could be different. 

Others have given some great suggestions about making sure she's connected with any blindness services she might need, like a training center or an o&m instructor. While that's happening, think about some small but significant things you both could do to change things in the household. The first step is to sit down and talk about things, at a point when you're both in a good headspace. She needs to know that you truly do love her, but things can't continue this way. She needs to know you believe in her, maybe more than she believes in herself right now. She may become upset or defensive, which in no way means you have done something wrong and should drop it. 

Once you've really got an open conversation going, you could start by making an agreement together on something small that you'll work on. An example might be her makeup. Let's say you've taught her, or she's learned from a tutorial, how to put on her lipstick. You could agree together that if she'd like you to do her makeup that day, she'll do the lipstick. If she's not feeling comfortable or confident enough when the time comes, you could be gently encouraging and supportive without actually stepping in to do all the makeup that day like you always have done before. If it turns out she doesn't wear any that day, no one is harmed and it's not the end of the world, but an important boundary has been established. 

I wish you both all the best in navigating this, and no matter what happens, please do take some time for yourself. You deserve it!
I have to agree. I'm not blind or considered visually impaired (joined the sub as have some vision loss that can't be corrected) so I can't speak from that perspective but have worked in mental health and with people with varying levels of vision. I have to agree that this sounds like a confidence or mental health thing. It sounds like she's feeling vulnerable or insecure so is asking for help with things she's capable of as a way of getting the reassurance she feels she needs to feel more safe and secure.

Once you've started helping someone in this way it can feel tricky to reset the boundaries but if it can be done in a way that demonstrates kindness and compassion I think that would be really helpful in promoting her confidence and create a healthier relationship for them both."
Can a blind person work as a dishwasher?,5,Blind,Universities have very high entry requirements and no workplace will take me if I'm self taught.
Why is the world so unforgiving?,49,Blind,"Uhm, wow; I'm not sure where to start. You're a senior in high school, correct? Where are your parent(s) / guardian(s) in all this? I'm not sure how things work where you live but do you have an IEP and a vision teacher (when I was growing up I had a teacher that came in and had a class where I learned braille, O&M, how to do things independently, etc). It sounds like you could use some adult help advocating for you with the school administration and your teacher. By all means you should also advocate for yourself but having other people in your corner is a good thing and you shouldn't be ashamed to ask people that care about you to get involved for you. Some teachers / people just suck and hopefully you get through her class and never have to have her teach you again.

..I can relate to a lot of what you said. Having aniridia, especially when i was younger and my vision was much better than it is now, my visual impairmenr/legal blindness was largely invisible to people, and in a way I never really fit in and was somewhere alone in between the sighted and non sighted worlds. Honestly it kinda fucking sucks and certainly didn't help my mental health lol.

Have you gotten the chance to meet other visually impaired and blind people your age? I remember going to summer camps that were just for those groups and it being fun and a good learning experience. I also got to go to space camp when I was little with other kids like me and it was really cool.

I feel you on the privileges thing, sighted people are way more privileged than they will ever realize or admit and a lot of people just suck and are ableist peices of shit. The number of people that can't drive for shit and don't know the right of way laws from their own ass makes my blood boil knowing that I know how to drive and can't yet these fuckers can and don't know how putting other peoples lives in danger because they don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves just pisses me off so much---anyways! Before I keep ranting lol.

I think that everyone learns differently and you just have to find the ways that work for you. You putting in the work is what matters and so long as you pass a certain grade isn't forever and won't hold you back in life--especially in college you'll find that some professors are easy graders, most are fair and follow the rubric, and some teachers are just impossible with their grading and expectations. You will get out of your degree what you put into it and the skills of how you do that are more important than what grade you get. What I'm trying to say is don't beat yourself up too much and try not to overstress. Try for great grades certainly but at the end of the day be kind to yourself.

I have seen some amazing people in this world and I don't think any career ambitions are necessarily out of the question simply because you are blind. I'm not sure what your career ambitions are but you should definitely do your research and try to connect with blind people that have been where you want to go. I think having examples and finding a mentor would be greatly beneficial to you. If you do have a vision itinerant or whatever they are called in your area definitely ask then for help finding a mentor, they have access to resources and can help you make connections / network.

Best of luck and don't give up. You need your right now.
I'm so sorry that this has happened to you.

None of this is your fault, and there is nothing lacking within yourself. People behave this way when they lack the ability to empathise, and/or refuse to educate themselves properly. As a teacher, they definitely ought to be doing so.

I do not think you are mentally unstable, I think you are a human being struggling with circumstances most cannot understand. School is hard enough without extra needs and challenges to overcome, but I do worry about the impact this could have on your mental health.

Is there someone you can trust and talk to? And does your school have any support for students with extra needs? Ideally there would be a way to report all of this and have it dealt with, but I am unsure about how the school system where you are operates.

For what it's worth you have talent, and you are capable of seeing the world very clearly (so to speak, I apologise). I hope that things improve for you!"
about to be 14 and starting to realise the negatives of my disability,31,Blind,I teach kids how to use canes for a living. I can’t imagine anyone using one for attention or anyone thinking you’d do that. If someone accuses you of doing that I would assume that they are seriously struggling with their mental health and that has more to do with them than you. So try not to worry about that too much. But I know it’s a big adjustment and just another thing to be self conscious about…My advice to you is to embrace it. Rock the cane! People will be jealous of your confidence. Anyone who gives you shit for it or makes you feel bad doesn’t deserve to be in your life. Hope this helps.
TO guide dog or not to guide dog.,7,Blind,"Do you mean emotional support animal as in one that goes with you everywhere?

Pets can definitely be good for mental health and emotions, whether that’s a dog, cat, or anything else. And I’m definitely not going to hate on someone who has a pet for the benefit of their mental health. 

The problem with emotional support animals is that there are no training standards. Someone can buy a vest online, and slap it on their ill-behaved pet, and take them places. And I’m talking dog that barks or lunges at other people, dog that poops inside, or dog that is otherwise disruptive. 

Understandably, business owners don’t want a dog in their establishment who is going to poop on the floor or jump up on other customers. And they may, not knowing the difference, assume guide dogs and other service dogs are equivalent, and refuse them service (even when they legally can’t). Thus, the poorly trained ESA makes it more difficult for trained service dog teams. 

As far as I’m concerned, if ESAs were trained to the same high standards of service dogs, I wouldn’t care about them. I don’t even really care if someone takes their well-trained pet with them. As long as the dog isn’t making a mess or being disruptive, it doesn’t bother me, whether they’re doing a specific job, or not. 

However, as long as there’s no training standard for emotional support animals, and people use it as an excuse to try and take their badly behaved pet with them, the whole thing is going to be a problem to guide dog handlers. 

BTW, I’m not a guide dog handler myself. I would like to get one in the future but don’t currently have a lifestyle where I would make good use of a dog.
No, I don’t want one that goes with me everywhere. A service dog that did travel with me on certain occasions would be a benefit, however that’s not something I want every day. I understand the repercussions of having a poorly trained E S A. That is why I want to go down the avenue of a service animal for mental health support rather than a dog guide.
Perhaps emotional support is not the word I'm looking for. There are dogs for mental health, and do bare in mind that laws in different places aren't the same as the US.
If I wanted a guide dog, I would have a guide dog. As I explained in my initial post, I don't always want to be traveling with the dog. There are days when I barely remember to take my house keys and all the other important stuff. If I can barely focus on myself and where I need to go, how can I also focus on keeping anyone else safe? People approaching me is something else I don't handle, hense not wanting a dog guide. If I'm going somewhere, I want to get from point A to Point B with was few distractions as possible.
Of course, your O&M skills have to be good to have a dog guide. I believe that my skills are sufficient enough and provide me enough independence that I don't require a dog. As I stated in a previous comment, there would be times more often than not where I would be doing the dogs work for them, making the job of the dog almost redundant.
If a mental health provider or other medical provider involved in your care writes you a letter stating you medically need the dog as part of your treatment plan, that ESA dog is protected the same way a service dog is, at least in the US. Look up FHA laws on Assistance Animals. Those cover SD, SDIT, and ESAs."
Seeking psychiatric help,13,Blind,"I've often said going blind is hard but being blind is easy.

Day to day life as a blind man has been way better than I expected but going through all the emotions and grieving that comes with the diagnosis was hell.

And nobody helped. Nobody explained the profound sense of loss I was about to experience. Nobody warned me how much it hurt to realize some of my dreams would never come true. Nobody told me about the jealousy and the anger and the depression in store.

All they told me was ""Call this number for a free white cane.""

It turns out most ophthalmologists don't understand the grief we go through. They aren't trained to deal with it and if we don't bring it up they don't bring it up, either.

It's a little messed up, isn't it? We're handed a life changing diagnosis and just assumed to take it in stride.

The truth is I'd be more worried about someone who didn't have a gut wrenching emotional reaction to learning they're going blind. Anybody who can lose their job and their driver's license and their hope for the future and NOT need a therapist to discuss the turning of their world upside down is scary.

Mental health counseling should be part of the diagnosis. It's unreasonable to expect us to not get messed up when we hear it. But it's not. We have to bring it up to our eye doctors to get a referral or we have to find a therapist ourselves.

I guess this is my way of saying I sympathize, I get it, and you're not alone.

There are counselors who specialize in disabilities and in grief. Hopefully someone in this thread recommends a good one in South Carolina to you,

In the meantime my DMs are always open and I'll link you to the blog posts where I write about figuring my own way through the grief and loss.
Others have addressed things well I just wanted to mention that you may be experiencing Charles Bonette Syndrome, a form of hallucinations created by the eye itself when vision is changing. It was first noticed in cataract patients but it can happen to anyone with enough vision loss. I have it and it took two retinal specialists to tell me what it was; it flares up worse when I'm sick or stressed. If the things you're seeing in the periphery of your vision are consistent, always in the same spot, and it's been going on for awhile, it may be Charles Bonett Syndrome, which isn't dangerous but it is annoying as hell heh. 

And I second what's been said elsewhere here. Going blind sucks hardcore, being blind isn't so bad once you get used to it. I think you may be eligible now for services like Medicaid and Social Security Income and if you can get on any of those you may have better help finding some mental health coverage.
It don’t have practical advice about your mental health question, except to say that I’ve found brief counseling sessions very helpful. With the state of our health care system, I think anyone seeking medical treatment would benefit from counseling support. Maybe look into a teledoc as a first step, if you have access.

I wanted to mention, though, that what you describe sounds somewhat like the visual aura that can accompany migraine in a couple of key ways:
- Visual aura often begin with the peripheral vision, and can be accompanied by other peripheral effects like tunnel vision.
- Mine typically progress to what I can only describe as flashy light worms that dance around my central vision.
- It’s fairly common for migraine sufferers to wake up with the symptoms. They can also be triggered by the whole long list of migraine triggers, from smells & foods to hormonal shifts, sleep deprivation, or stress.
- They aren’t always accompanied by migraine pain. I had weird (& upsetting) aural symptoms for a few years before ever experiencing my first migraine headache. They did, however, respond to migraine medication or sleep.

The Wikipedia article on Scintillating Scotoma has some reasonable artistic renderings of what they look like, although none of them are exactly what I see. Check it out and see if they look familiar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma"
Maybe a good community?,0,Blind,Certainly doesn't encourage openness; one of the most important parts of any mental health discussion.
Lost Eyesight Left Eye. Gap Quarter (Gap Year?),6,Blind,"I'm blind in my left eye, been that way since birth, and usually when i go out in public, i wear an eye patch and people usually don't really bring it up or say anything about it. So in regards to that, based off my own experiences, it shouldn't really be an issue. Though if like me, you end up using a white cane to help with ""seeing"" on your blind side and the lack of depth perception, expect people to be super awkward and weird about it and just always assume you have less sight than you actually do and people seem to always notice the cane and never notice the eye patch, at least in my experience. But if using a white cane helps you, don't let how others react to the cane discourage you, though I do realize that's significantly easier said than done. And if others are super weird and awkward about you using a white cane, getting a cane that's customized to be colors you like/to fit your aesthetic will help a lot in making other people less awkward and weird about it and in improving your confidence/willingness to use it. And again, I'm speaking from own experience of being a monocular my whole life, though i didn't start wearing an eye patch and using a cane till last year since my family refused to ever acknowledge and help me accommodate my disability. And I haven't gone to college yet so I can't speak on how adjusting to and attending college would be like with your disability, and I can't speak on how it might affect your mental health. And I also, obviously, can't really speak on the mental health impact of going from fully sighted to a monocular and how the adjustment to that might be like since I obviously never went through that adjustment period."
Do any other visually impaired people feel like they have some cognitive issues from over-tiredness?,16,Blind,"I've been on and off medication for mental health issues since I was 13, so I absolutely understand how you feel, at least to an extent one can. The other day I cried for 20 minutes because we got the wrong ice cream at the grocery store, which is not an appropriate reaction to ice cream. Please know you have the sympathy and emotional support of this internet stranger."
seeking braille fulltime.,10,Blind,"You can modify all screen readers to do things similarly to the Braillenote.  For example the students I teach who come from the Touch like to check their power with enter&p, their time with enter&t and so on. They're familiar commands that let them move to Windows or whatever with less of a jarring change.

Unfortunately a Braillenote won't get you terribly far in many workplaces. I'm afraid you do need to consider moving to some more mainstream tech.  For all the Braillenote is a neat idea, they are not a one-stop solution for life. Every app in KeySoft is so cut down as to make it useless for adults who need to lead fulfilling, productive, employed lives. The evidence for this is simple; they had to move from KeyWeb, a cut-down web browser, to something more mainstream to keep up.  
you can probably bury your head in the sand and pass at college or whatever because 1, people may feel you can't move to something new and, 2, they'll believe Humanware's marketing that the BrailleNote is a modern, powerful and all-in-one solution for productivity.  But I've never seen a respected colleague using one exclusively. Sure, some people use them for noettaking, some even check their emails now and then, and a very few people browse the web with them.  But everyone with whom I work as an adult who is blind can also use an iPad, or a phone, or a computer of some sort to do the things where the Braillenote falls down. 
With a Braillenote, you won't be able to collaborate with sighted colleagues on a presentation or a document in real time.  You won't be able to access the vast majority of online training materials an employer might require you to undertake. You'll struggle to react to suggestions from colleagues on your own documents or to track changes and make comments or suggestions in theirs. You'll find almost any online platform - for timesheets, tech support tickets, live chat, knowledge-base work or any number of other things difficult and, unless you're going to lug around a computer monitor, nobody's going to see what you're doing as you do it or work side-by-side with you on something.

I'm not saying give up Braille by any means, but learn to use it with hardware that the rest of the world uses too. That way, if your phone or computer dies, you can connect your Braille to another one.  If there's a necessary upgrade or change, everyone else will be going through it too. And if the Braille device itself dies, you can rely temporarily on using Braille Screen input, or 6key entry on a qwerty keyboard. So many more options if you untie yourself from Humanwares handholding, expensive, underpowered, inefficient and dumbed-down system.
Perhaps we just see things. Differently.
I’m no voc rehab teacher or anything, but you’re going to need JAWS to be successful in college and in the workplace. I would recommend having a laptop with JAWS and a Braille display so you still have tactile feedback. You may need further training to use the computer if you’re not used to it. If you can get a Braille display funded, I would go for one that’s a hybrid like the Brailliant, because I assume you’re quicker at typing with a Perkins keyboard rather than a computer keyboard and if that’s the case, that’ll be really beneficial during lectures.
I don't see what's wrong with humanware system



Maybe it's because I've been raised on it but I kind of love the way the humanware devices work and none of the other screen readers have the three metal buttons that the brown notes have which are the most convenient things ever when paired with a thumb keys and everything I can navigate it so quickly



You brought up key web and how that's proof that they don't advance but I think it's proof they do advance because they did switch over to Chrome and a whole bunch of other things and it works really good on Chrome I've used it so they can catch up and keep up with other technology



What is it exactly that would leave me out of most workplaces honestly someone mentioned the example of needing to play a disc or something but I don't think most workplace is used those



And I'm not really looking for a job in corporate America anyway as I'd rather do something more creative



Besides there's workplace life and then there's personal life isn't there



I could still use one for my all my personal everything and maybe have a backup that I could use for a workplace job if I really needed one




And I'm sure I could work around jobs that would make it completely non-viable I already will have to ask for accommodations anyway  lots of people don't take jobs where they have to do something they aren't comfortable with


There's a whole wide world out there I'm sure I could work with something 


There's got to be something out there I can do
The Braille Note touch plus has full internet connectivity

It can access pretty much any app my phone can

I'm sorry I thought I was facing I guess I forgot to press the line twice every time most Reddit posts seem to have everything they write in spaced out when my reader reads them

As for job it's not about John specifically it's about the idea of a computer without any access to Braille

I can do some basic job enough that I can use the computer and probably an emergency if I need to but I don't want it to be my main device for the rest of my life

Especially not for anything important I might want to do they say I might not be able to use the device I want for every job but ... Well the field I want to go in I I probably be a better writer if I could use braille and not a computer that made me uncomfortable so if I want to be a writer Braille would be more beneficial than a computer
And if I want to be a voice actor which is another career path I've been considering since people have scared me into not wanting to write anymore I don't see how a computer would change me being able to record myself I could do that just if easily on the Braille device

It's hardly a slate and chisel as mentioned it connects to the internet and runs every other app just fine it's not as if I'm deciding I'd rather run on a Perkins or even a mountbatten or even an apex or even a braille Note touch all of which are somewhat outdated 

The brown Note touch Plus is a perfectly usable modern device that they don't want to give me because and I swear I'm not making this up

I won't be able to change the font on PowerPoints I'll need to do for college presentations

At least that was the argument the use for switching me to job mid-school year

Just about the only important thing that that device wouldn't be able to do we have to place a phone call and I do have a phone for that

Anything else it wouldn't be able to do probably isn't important to my day-to-day life

And therefore for the personal device I want to live the rest of my life using I don't see why I couldn't use this one other than the fact that the provider won't give me one because they say it won't be useful for as you said every possible job

I guess this resource is very specifically about getting a job but I thought part of it was also about living independently which this would apply to

And I could look for jobs I could do with it

If a blind person I'm already used to be idea that there are certain jobs I won't be able to do because of me being blind and me using advice that couldn't do a certain thing I'll just add to the list of reasons why I couldn't do a certain job

But you'd think if they weren't going to let people use these devices they wouldn't actually provide them and raise kids on them their entire lives

I need to have a physical connection with my words in order to write and feel comfortable with it audio only doesn't really work with me even now I'm using my microphone on my phone to dictate what I'm saying and I'm worried that it's not working because it has a history of sucking but going back to edit it would be a pain I'd have to go line by line word by word character by character with individual little swipes if I was using Braille I probably could have written and posted this comment minutes ago I'm much faster at it it's more convenient it works better and I feel more comfortable with it and safer it

If I was stuck on a computer for the rest of my life it would pretty much destroy my sense of Independence and make every interaction with technology uncomfortable which isn't what I want for the rest of my life

I know it's pathetic but yeah the specific devices actually important to my mental health it always gets worse on summer break when I have to use my phone and don't have access to Braille

Call me a dinosaur if you'd like but I do think that device is relatively modern and in fact I'm pretty sure it's a lot newer than Windows computers or the Jaws program
I did use double lines


And there's plenty they can do


I've been on one for years trust me there's a lot you can do with them if you know how to use them correctly plus they might have changed it a bit since whenever you did did it since they do adapt




And there's a difference between learning to adapt and completely changing your entire system for no real reason



And personal preference and mental health aren't just excuses I mean it's so much more than that 


If the position was reversed and they you were told you could only ever use a braille note and couldn't use a computer you wouldn't be thrilled is that just a preference or would you learn to adapt



It's one thing if there's a reason to adapt like I said I've gone through about five different stages of device through my lifetime


But it's another thing to switch all together notice those five different devices I'll use a Perkins keyboard all you similar systems all you similar operating


Lord adapt means to alter something to fit a new environment not to throw away everything for something completely new that has nothing to do with anything else and no connection to the previous anything whatsoever that's more than adapting


Looks like expecting someone to go straight from a landline to a smartphone without something in between or sometime to get the hang of it



What is it exactly that you think this device can't do that's so important that I need to change everything to get it instead



Cuz it can access the internet and work with a good amount of speed it can send emails it can access any app on the Android play store and it has a really good keyword editor that allows me to save and monitor and access all my files that I have on my flash drive
It has Braille and an accessible and easy to learn system with the thumb keys and the cursor routing keys and the e chords and everything else that another device from another system wouldn't know wouldn't have
It's faster and more convenient and doesn't have a slow robot voice
It has a neat screen under the keys that a fighter person could look at or that you could use touch Braille with if you needed to so it wouldn't cut you off from any sighted people
It can connect to a large monitor if absolutely necessary if the screen is too small
you can use apps like Google sheets for when you need to make PowerPoints although I admit it not great with PDF but a PDF is kind of recited people anyway and I can just get it changed to a keyword document if I need the information
It can download attachment from emails easily
It comes with a neat book reader and you can install any others that you want to get a hold of
You can turn speech on and off and still use braille if you don't want there to be any sound so you're not locked to audio only and you can actually multitask and listen to music or something while writing which with any device that wouldn't let you use braille you wouldn't be able to do because you'd have to have the audio
It provides fast neat and convenient editing you can move through lines quickly or jump straight to whatever word you're looking for pop the cursive around wherever you need to and don't have to swipe character by character up and down with a fingernail or by pressing the arrow keys
I could go on but seriously what is it lacking but so important that means it's a device I can never use for the rest of my life?


what is it about the life-eyed lead that would be so impossible that I have to change and get a computer that give me anxiety


Please I'm very curious to know if these people who say I'm living in the past have a legitimate argument or not because so far I haven't heard one that actually made sense


And if you had brio you could probably read at a different pace and not have to deal with your screen reader apparently not being able to read spaced out lines maybe something's wrong with your screen reader because I am using double lines as you requested seems like your screen reader is not great

But go on please tell me why your screen reader is better than being able to read what's on screen so you can tell where the punctuation is and how the words are spelled and which words are being used

I'm very curious and would love to know since I haven't found any major problems in my life that I think I need to fix and so far there's nothing really big missing from it other than the fact that some fighting things I can't do like look at pictures and play video games but I don't think that's something that can be solved by changing devices
It's not childish


I don't like my mom then anytime you get sick or upset I'm just making it up in my head


Okay I'm not making up the fact that whenever I have to use the computer I start getting nervous and my chest hurts tightening and I breathe faster



Huge screen gives me trust issues before anyone's even near me



I'm not making up the fact that I'm faster trail or feel safer with a braillenote


Just because I know my limits and I've considered them and I'm going to try and work around them like how any disabled person works around any form of their disability doesn't mean I'm being childish


Or is it childish truth refused to get surgery to get their your eyesight back rather than staying blind


Should we all just get cured and change our entire life because I'd be more convenient for everybody else right


Control no one's going to hire a blind truck driver so if you want that job you better go get eyesight back


And if that's not the job you want for your life that doesn't matter you should do it anyway



Do you hear how dumb that sounds



This is the same thing okay



It's not being childish to take the few steps necessary to preserve some of my mental health when I'm definitely not going to be getting therapy because it's too expensive and probably won't do anything anyway


But instead I can work on it myself and try to take the stuff to necessary to make sure I'm actually happy



I can work with or around what I need to I've been doing that my entire life


Why should I stop now


I'm not going to become excited even though my mom wants me to is that also being childish and refusing to change cuz she thinks my life would be better if I could see


Send how many people are upset by the mere concept of forcing someone to have their disabilities erased even in fiction for some reason I doubt that


So how about we stop shoving mental health aside like it doesn't matter and treat it like it's just as valid as the any physical disability


Thanks
This is a sighted world. How a document looks makes it easier to read which is very important in the workplace. Actually, it’s very important everywhere. I hear your various arguments but the bottom line is if you’re planning on being a successful adult you are going to have to make some changes. It is not easy learning things that we have no interest in but, if you’re planning on joining the workforce , knowing JAWS is a necessary step to getting a decent job in an office environment for most visually impaired people. You don’t have to do it. But don’t expect the world to adjust to your stubbornness. We all like to use the devices we like to use, but if circumstances call for us to change we have to adapt. 
As far as making a living in the Arts, very few people make enough money at it to support themselves without other income."
"Inspired by u/brb_28 I need to leave my country I think, but I have no qualifications?",3,Blind,"Oh, wow, I am so sorry that you are struggling with mental health right now, and I am so sorry your family thinks so little of you and your abilities. 

You said you lived in the UK for four years before? I’m not sure what passport you hold because some are stronger than others, but were you on a student visa? I only ask because sometimes when it comes to trying to get to “indefinite to remain” or “permanent resident” type visas, the time accrued under a student visa doesn’t count toward your “time in” if that makes sense.

Obviously I am not super knowledgeable on this matter. I do agree with u/bradley22 that going for a month and trying to talk to someone there would be a great place to start."
Eight years of total blindness and I'm yet to find a reason to live,50,Blind,"Well if I have ADHD, it hasn't been diagnosed yet, and I've been through a lot of mental health specialists during the last 8 years.  I've also Googled ADHD and at least the description in the featured snippet doesn't sound like me at all.  I'm not impulsive, don't struggle with paying attention, attempt to predict the outcome of all my actions, and am not very energetic.  The reason why I used to play games was twofold: I liked to immerse myself in another reality and be the hero in single-player games and I liked to help others achieve their objectives in cooperative multi-player games.

As for my motivation, I lose it because I can't perform as well as I like.  For example I just bought another Raspberry Pi along with its official touchscreen despite being totally blind because I want to play around with computer graphics on Linux and want to dedicate my first Pi to serve content on the Internet, however I will most likely get demotivated once the project for which I bought it is near completion because little things that I cannot pay attention to due to being blind will affect the final experience and I will only learn about them too late.  I've been through this before, but keep acting like I still have sight or this time it will be different.

I'm a creative person, and attention to detail used to characterize me.  My goal in life used to be to provide memorable experiences that people could feel unconsciously even if they couldn't appreciate.  I feel good not when people compliment me but rather when they try the same kind of product made by someone else and complain about things they hadn't even thought about while using my creations, and to that end I don't mind to put more effort into making things than most would, but I also expect quality as a result.  The problem is that right now my extra effort is only compensating for my disability, and in addition I think I've reached a plateau from which I cannot progress no matter how hard I work."
