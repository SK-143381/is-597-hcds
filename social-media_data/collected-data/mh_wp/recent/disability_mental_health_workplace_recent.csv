Finding mental healthcare for coing with disability,10,disability,"I find from my experience on disability. With mental health being one of my disabilities , all any of my docs do is push meds . I’m on my 4th antidepressant :(
During COVID times, i devised a online platform concept where people can get counseling and holistic care for their mental health issues. I am not aware ( have not researched online) if such a platform exists even today, but its something i feel will address the issue of scalability in providing mental healthcare .  
Can you please explain more what you exactly mean by a 'disability informed' approach ? It is not clear from your post.
For years the mental health services place I was in would change my therapist every 5-6months each one it took me a long time to get established with near when I suddenly hear they are changing me and it’s made it really hard to find anyone who understands.

Last year they did a switch and thankfully have not been removed from this therapist as they happen to understand me on both the ADHD front (we both have that and I’ve got autism too) but on my physical health stuff and how it’s impacted parts of my mental health and vice versa. She’s helped me make a lot of progress and really work on advocating for myself more as well as not getting so stuck in doom brain mode like I used to whenever something bad happens.

First therapist in years I’ve ever made any genuine progress with towards a better quality of life.

It reminds me of all my past ones and makes me quite sad, the old ones were always the quite ones who sat there and waited for me to say something or just go “how are you today?” And never try leading anything to make the conversation easier and more natural. They also rarely bothered to learn about my disabilities and how they effected me so I never really opened up to those ones about me and my stuff and what effects me what works and what doesn’t etc."
"I am in desperate need of advice, I’m still getting used to everything ",2,disability,"FND and conversion disorder are both very real and the symptoms can be very disabling. Have you seen a neuro PT at all? I'd highly recommend getting in to see one. They are pretty amazing and the one I got to shadow could pretty quickly work out if it was something organic or if it was something functional. She also has an awesome success rate with her fnd patients.

I'd also highly suggest seeing a psychologist. Dealing with unexplained symptoms is tough and you need to look after your mental health as much as your physical health. Poor mental health can make your symptoms a whole lot worse no matter what the diagnosis turns out to be, but if it is fnd or conversion disorder then it'll really make things a lot harder to recover from."
"Donald Trump labels his opponent, Kamala Harris, ‘mentally disabled’ in latest rhetorical escalation",220,disability,Well obviously no one has ever considered trumps mental health issues either.
"I’m becoming bitter at a friend calling themselves disabled, and I don’t like it",152,disability,"I always say ""it's not the disability olympics"".  It seems like for whatever reason your friend feels the need to compare your situation and symptoms to theirs every time you bring something up, and I GET why that makes you uncomfortable, and pushes you further into being uncomfortable with them labeling common dx that would not typically be considered disabling by the medical community as disabling to them. It probably feels like they are coopting that identity for themselves, when you've just barely gotten used to it for you.

A few things that might help- you seem to be pretty certain this friend actually does have pain and isn't simply malingering. Remind yourself that they may be clinging to your symptoms so hard, because their own common dxs that they have been given so far might not adequately explain the volume and type of pain they perceive. There might be more going on for them the they are able to get dx'd at the moment. There may be mental health complications that are making the physical issues they experience significantly more difficult to navigate.

Most importantly though, I have found with people like this, it's important to validate their experience repeatedly and obviously: I tell them that yeah, that really sucks and must be difficult, that I can't understand their particular pain/symptom because mine is different, but that that doesn't really matter because pain is pain symptoms are symptoms, one type isn't worse or better than the other because any kind of pain or symptoms make life hard to navigate. That I can't compare my pain to theirs because that's apples to oranges BUT that I empathize that they struggle with pain, and all types of pain suck. It takes time (months often), but usually the person stops competing their symptoms against mine, instead simply discussing what they actually struggle with, and asking what I do.

Sometimes, none of that works and I just straight up refuse to discuss my health with the person any more. If they bring it up, I say thanks for asking but I'd rather not discuss it right now and would prefer to discuss only happy topics. Then I immediately change the subject (its very helpful to have anyone else you hang out with also on this plan if you go this route- my husband knows the people who fall in this category and backs me up). If they bring up their own health, I also politely say, I'm sorry you are dealing with that--and then immediately change the subject. They eventually figure out the topic is off the table.

It's about THEM and ultimately has very little to do with you. The reason they choose to identify as disabled isn't something you are entitled to or can change - even if they are genuinely malingering - but you can change how you respond to it, and in no way are you required to participate in the disability olympics. That takes way too much energy!
Something to keep in mind is doing the appointments themselves and not keeping up with the homework might just be all they’re capable of doing. Especially if they’re neurodivergent consistency issues is probably a part of them being disabled. It definitely is for me and I had to quit PT because of the amount of shame/guilt and annoyance I got from the therapist for that exact issue. It really sucks cause I definitely need the therapy.

Idk what their exact issues are but a lot of things have to be self diagnosed in order to get a formal disagnosis as access to practitioners is difficult and sometimes impossible. If I hadn’t self diagnosed my autism I probably never would’ve gotten an official appointment.

Idk if that helps the emotions or not but I hope it at least helps with some perspective.

You also might just be providing actual information they don’t know how to get otherwise so they see it as really helpful and are saying it partially as a “hey thanks I didn’t know about this. It feels familiar”

I think talking with them is an important step cause it sounds like they’re not aware at all. And maybe talking with a therapist as well if you haven’t already. I can understand it being annoying and downright distressing so taking care of your own mental health is important also.

It’s not necessarily anyone’s fault or “problem” you might just need additional emotional support around it which is really important. And they might need an explanation cause they sound oblivious and are likely unaware of the harm it’s causing.

Even just something simple like “hey I’m glad I’m able to help with perspective and information but when I talk about specifics like this I’m usually looking for emotional support instead of comparison and sometimes the immediate jump to how you feel about it can be hurtful when I need support.”

Your feelings are definitely valid either way also like your feelings are telling you important stuff and it’s important to listen to them fully and figure out what they’re trying to tell you even if you don’t talk directly about it to your friend.l about the specifics.
While I agree that disability isn't a competition (I think we can all agree that would be one crappy comp), it sounds to me as if they might have just one mental health disorder. One super-specific one. I won't mention it here, because I'm not a PhD of Psychology, but it sounds as though this person should get checked out for their mental health for this exact reason. 

Encourage them, tell them that the psychologist would love to hear about all the diagnoses they've gotten, how they're taking care of themselves with them, and how much of a struggle it is to find out that yet another new ailment they've never heard of has been ""found"" to be affecting them. Trust those of us who have been to a real psych doc, there's no way your friend will get out of that room without the diagnosis of this one particular mental health issue. 

After that, for them, it will be far harder to convince any doctor that something else new is happening with their health, unless the doctor comes to that conclusion themselves. And you will finally have the peace of mind in knowing that your friend is actually disabled, so I guess you ""win""?

Or the easier way, stop being friends. You aren't in a good headspace to handle them, and they just want a sounding board for all their perceived ailments. It's unhealthy for both of you, and since they're obviously more needful of your time than you are of theirs, you have to be the one to cut the cord.
That’s happened to me too.  I’ve had multiple mental health professionals fire me as their patient because they said I was too difficult to work with.  It honestly really triggered my PTSD.  When I think about it, I try to tell myself that the real problem wasn’t that I’m too difficult, but that they clearly didn’t have the experience/expertise/education on my specific conditions to properly help me.  When a mental health professional says something like that what it really means is that they’re not good enough at their job to treat you, not that you are a bad person or a failure somehow 
That's really cool. I'm glad you enjoyed the experience so much. I prefer reading books and stuff to dealing college campuses though. lol. I think although going the psychology special interest route might be a particularly challenging path, I'd say it becomes invaluable. Versus learning communication skills without having as much foundational understanding of why it's effective on most people.

Granted, it's not really fair to expect every autistic person to devote years of their life to studying human psychology to mesh better with society. So I feel like I've gone around in a circle to some extent where the original intent was to essentially get really good at masking (even in private out of internalized ableism), and now I understand enough about psychology to know that level of masking is detrimental to my mental health and so I do it less.

I'm still trying to strike that balance between being safe and being myself because while ex: rocking back and forth when stressed hurts absolutely no one, it absolutely does draw a lot of unwanted and potentially even dangerous attention.
You’d hope so, but unfortunately mental health professionals aren’t always as ethical as we’d expect them to be"
How to Get a Mental Health Evaluation Abroad Recognized for U.S. Disability Support?,1,disability,"If you are talking about Social Security disability, there are two different programs.  The first is SSDI - Social Security Disability Insurance.  This is the disability coverage your FICA taxes go toward.   Generally, an adult who has never worked or paid into the Social Security system (and thus never earned work credits) is not eligible for SSDI.  There is a limited exception called DAC (disabled adult child) benefits, where someone who became disabled before age 22 can draw SSDI based on a parent's earning record.  However, DAC benefits can only be paid if the parent is already drawing SS disability or retirement benefits, or is deceased.  So even if it were established that David became disabled before the age cutoff, he still would not receive benefits until you start drawing retirement or disability benefits yourself, or you predecease him.   

The other disability program is SSI - Supplemental Security Income for the blind, elderly and disabled.  It is a means-tested program with very strict income and asset limits for eligibility, and the most it pays is currently less than $950 per month.   He will not be eligible for SSI unless he was actually living in the U.S.  

I'm unsure of the answer to your question about disability evaluations conducted by a non U.S. physician, but I suspect the answer is they would not be enough for Social Security purposes.   To qualify for social security disability, the claimant needs very complete, compelling medical documentation.  This is especially true for mental health issues.  

There are other programs such as Medicaid for which David might become eligible if he lived in the U.S., but these programs vary a lot by state, so you would need to look at what's available specifically in your state. 

Given the complexity of David's situation, I would highly recommend that you consult with an attorney knowledgeable about disability issues, especially about estate/life care planning for the needs of a disabled adult child.  

Have you talked to David about whether he wants to come to live with you, or to live in the U.S.?  It seems like this would be the most important first step to take.  As David would be considered an adult in the U.S., you would not have the right to make decisions on his behalf.  If you believe he is unable to make his own medical, financial and legal decisions, you may need to consider seeking guardianship or conservatorship.  At minimum, you would need to hold his power of attorney and health care proxy in order to apply for services on his behalf or be involved in medical decision making."
Is this Disability Discrimination (UK)?,0,disability,"I am unsure if it's discrimination, but comparing a non physical access need to a physical access need doesn't help your case. I'm not saying PTSD is easy, or not an impairment - but you are able to physically access the building, and a physically impaired person is simply not.

It'd work better to frame this entirely within a mental health accessibility context, as these are simply different problems with different managements.

I'll also say under UK law, it's about whether or not your access requirement is deemed ""reasonable"" by the organisation providing the access. They'll argue that they have provided reasonable access measures most likely, so going forward with discrimination is unlikely to get you anywhere.

Hopefully PALS can help you find a solution though!
I am in the US so I'm not talking about UK law, although we share a common legal ancestry and sometimes share precedent. I am only sharing my experiences and what can be, in my country, considered undue burden. Your legal system also uses the same ""reasonable"" terminology as the US and your Equality Act explicitly states that discrimination is unlawful *unless there is good reason*.

My husband died in a hospital in my city. It was deeply traumatizing. I need to receive a specific medical treatment there every quarter. When I asked it be moved to a different hospital in my city, in the same hospital system, I was denied. My provider doesn't work at the hospital and the treatment I receive isn't provided there - I need to go to the specific specialty clinic to receive my treatment. I worked with my therapist at the time to develop coping strategies to learn to manage being in the same hospital where he died.

I think it's worthwhile to ask if there is a reason it needs to be at this specific hospital, but I also think it's important to be aware of hierarchies of power, whether we find them just or unjust, and function accordingly. If you need this medical care and the people with the power to provide you the medical care will only provide it at this singular location, it might be an option to work with your mental health care team to develop coping strategies around this specific trigger (grounding techniques, EMDR, being accompanied by someone to support and guide you through the current moment, etc).
I don’t think you fully understand, and to be fair that’s my fault for making not making it clear. I have tried to access the building with support of mental health professionals and suffered a psychotic break in the process, harming myself and trying to harm others. The building is not only inaccessible for me, it’s dangerous to myself and others.

There have provided no access measures at all to tackle the issue. It’s not an issue with the department or what will happen at the appointment. It’s an issue with the building. So don’t know how that would be considered reasonable.

I think the comparison to physical disabilities is a tricky one, personally, I think they are often taken more seriously than mental disabilities and it helps me get the point across that in the eyes of the law they should be the same.
I’m way past the point of grounding techniques helping. Being there with someone does not help, we have tried. I have suffered a psychotic break trying to get into that building supported by two mental health nurses. It’s inaccessible for me. I also know an ECG can be done at almost any hospital around here, it’s not a specialised test.
Thank you so much. It absolutely sucks that things like this happen and I’m sorry you were in such an awful situation. I’m the same with not being able to drive past the building. Unfortunately as I’m in Wales I don’t have ‘right to choose’ so I have any right to swap my cars to another place without extremely good reason. I just really hope PALS helps me in advocating that my mental health condition is good reason.
Personally, I don't believe that comparison works well - coming from both a physically disabled person, and as someone who worked in accessibility for a number of years. Whether we like it or not, the organisation is placed in power over the individual in these situations, therefore it's less about the principle and more about what they will accept as an argument.

That is why I would advise to avoid the comparison, as the easy retort is ""This isn't a physical accessibility issue"" because it isn't, and that can stop the discussion there and then.

What you have outlined above about danger is way more in line with what they may accept. They are unlikely to accept the building being the issue - as the issue is the building may add to a certain response, the response is what is denying access.

I don't know what they may argue back, but they'd probably say that the support of mental health professionals constitutes a reasonable adjustment. Regardless, I stand by my point that I don't think comparison to physical impairment is helpful - and in the eyes of the law, it's not about the nature of the impairment, it's about what the organisation deem ""reasonable"" and that does change based on accessibility needs.
If you don't get anywhere with the cardiologists, it might help to talk to your mental health team about the issue, since they seem to be very involved in your care. (I didn't want to assume - from my understanding it can be very difficult to get mental health care with the NHS.) They are going to be infinitely more informed about your challenges and what has and has not worked for you in the past than me, an internet stranger.

If they're in the same hospital system, perhaps your mental health team could advocate on your behalf to have your testing moved to a different building?"
About to give up,3,disability,"I left my job because I had a manager who would not accommodate my mental health I have serve anxiety so I asked for different hours and a place to go to calm down but they didn’t said I go in to office but people come and go then they feel obliged to ask if I’m ok and burst out crying they run away so I started going to my car and calling help lines and mangers didn’t like it. I got signed off and I wasn’t told I need to have a meeting if off for month so I missed a call and got accused of being on holiday and faking my anxiety, I now suffer with agoraphobia and scared to leave home as fear people think I’m faking and should be working. I just quit I miss working but our health is more important so I choose health. You can go back when you are better and ask her to make these arrangements to on your return."
People believe depression is disabling until you actually show signs of being disabled,202,disability,"Society is victim to capitalist propaganda. We've been conditioned to equate human value with ability to work. With making money. If you aren't doing those things, people perceive you as a deadweight, a mooch, a leach, a parasite, etc. But there's a huge difference between sitting around doing nothing because you simply don't want to work or contribute and not working because of a legitimate reason. I honestly think people get jealous. That they want a break from their daily grind, and that's why they're so eager to accuse disabled people of not trying hard enough or ""faking"" it. Oh, the irony, right? Jealous of this??? They truly don't know how much we suffer if they feel jealous of us. Their feelings are so misdirected though. What they should be doing is getting mad at their employers for exploiting them and unionizing the workplace if possible. They wouldn't feel so jealous if they actually had decent work hours, decent vacation times, PTO, paid sick days, and actually good benefits.
I try to not care when others say things like this to me. But it’s so hard. Where I grew up many people didn’t believe in mental illness (Bible Belt of America).I feel terrible when I am unable to do anything I feel like I’m supposed to constantly be doing things but I can’t. 
When I got approved for disability I felt so validated and seen. I thought I’d be trying to get approved for years fighting because I have mental illness. I have BPD, MDD, ADHD, NSSIB, EDNOS, GAD, CPTSD IBS and “marijuana abuse”. People think I’m lazy but my body is in constant pain, I take 4 daily medications, have side effects, extremely poor memory, can’t focus on anything I dissociate all of the time, just took a shower yesterday in I don’t know how long and I’ve lost 20lb in 2 months. I want to do things but I can’t, why do people think we want this? It is miserable. I wish I could just do things, I’ve lost my life to mental illness. I’ve missed spring and summer because I can’t make myself do anything. I wish I could enjoy my life but that’s never happened. I wish I could’ve gone to the beach this summer, smell the flowers in spring, i wanted to swim and go on hikes. I want to be outside for autumn but instead I wake up crying and have the energy for nothing, I sleep because it keeps me safe from myself. I’ve lost my only friend because they don’t understand and would compare their physical illness to my mental illness. 
I try to tell myself “who cares what others think” but it’s so hurtful to be judged by my mental illness and lack of ability to take care of myself. I can’t do my ADL’s and I just wish they would have sympathy. When I get bad and reach out for help, I get lectured and yelled at by people who are supposed to love and care about me. 
Mental illness is illness and I will never stop advocating for us. No matter how many people judge/dislike me. Everyone deserves access to have a roof over their heads, everyone deserves accessible mental health care. It’s not our fault, we did not choose this.
Substitute severe anxiety for me, which leads to depression because of inaction. I feel so seen. I toiled and hated it for 30 years. I can't seem to do it anymore. I've never heard that term bedrotting, but I feel like this is what I'm doing. My bed is my safety zone. I'm so poor, but I live with a friend who understands. I try to do Gigwork, but I feel so scared to go ""out there."" It's avoidance of discomfort to the point of great fear. I failed again yesterday. This is probably one of the worst developed countries to have mental health issues in. This is a pull-up- your-bootstraps kinda country. Hard work!! Make money!! Don't be ""lazy!!"" Do whatever it takes to get ahead and be successful or die!! I hate being like this. I have lots of help and meds, but there is no magic bullet to fix my mind. I am put off by the oversimulation of the work day, business hours, The Rat Race, Hustle and Bustle, etc. Something happened to me over time. This society seems to have very little tolerance for debilitating mental health. It's only helped by SSI or SSDI, which people can barely survive off of without help from loved ones and friends. That's only IF you win Disability. I hate being like this, but I HAVE contributed to society and want to live a good rest of my life. I'm 55. Fear keeps me at home, and that depresses me. I didn't used to be like this, but I've had massive, traumatic life changes over the last 20 years.
Sorry if it's too personal, but were you diagnosed with a mental health condition and then also diagnosed with CFS?

I have a mental condition and I realize it (and the medication) can make a person tired, but sometimes I can hardly function. My mother was also diagnosed with CFS, but I never took it seriously until now.
Yup, I've gone two months a few times without showering and doing quite well if I can make it once a week. I have schizophrenia and the negative symptoms can look a lot like severe depression and are worsened by meds. Avolition, alogia and anhedonia are big ones. My life isn't something to be envied when I live in poverty and can't manage to clean myself or my house and rarely even get any enjoyment from video games or my old hobbies and don't have the concentration for a movie. For years I had musical anhedonia. Of all the ailments I've had mental illness is the worst and the cruelest, I don't know why people actually take it less seriously. Mental health is health."

How to bring up disability to therapist?,5,disability,"Therapists love getting this information early on.


You could write a list to hand over during the appointment, send an e-mail in advance, give a PowerPoint presentation, make a diagram.


The first session will start with your therapist going over their terms of service, and making sure you understand their duty of care/mandatory reporter responsibilities, and consent to be their client.


Then they'll ask why you're seeing them, and that's when you give the rundown of all the stuff going on with you.


It might help you to prepare a timeline in advance that you can refer to. (When various conditions/symptoms became obvious to you, when you received diagnoses, key periods of abuse or traumatic events, etc.)


I honestly don't know what role your therapist could play in ""helping with my disability and struggles with the medical system"". What do you mean by that?


They can help you find and trial strategies to protect your mental health, build resilience, and get stuff done. They can help you process trauma and heal, help you learn how to build healthy relationships etc. 


They probably can't help you with paperwork unrelated to therapy or navigating the system, advise your decisions or advocate for you. 


But they can help you work out what decision you want to make, and some therapists do have lived experience navigating these systems and can tell you what worked for them.
I apologize if this is untoward, but I do not understand this question.

Of course we can tell our providers that we are disabled! A mental health therapist is not necessarily going to be aware of the physical health conditions. In my experience, it has only been therapists who are in a clinic in the same hospital system as my physical health doctors who have access to my diagnoses and medications. Every other therapist, I have had to tell them about my diagnoses and medications. Even when the therapist is with the hospital system, I generally need to spell out what my diagnoses mean because even most medical providers are not familiar with what I have and even then, they are not familiar with what I experience day-to-day unless I tell them.

OP isn't talking about applying for disability benefits - I assume your comment is aimed at folks who are applying for government disability benefits like SSI/SSDI since you mention ""that this has been going on for at least a year."" OP is just seeing a therapist to cope with a traumatic experience regarding their mobility aid and thus very much should be in a position to talk about the need for that mobility aid."

Almost homeless… what do I do? ,14,disability,"That sounds about accurate. 

Bed in DV shelters are at a premium - last I knew, my city's DV shelter had a waitlist and they only accept women (and young children) abused by a male partner. 

Waitlists for public housing are very long. Prior to the pandemic, I briefly dated a man who works with HUD in public housing and he said (out of frustration) that people had better odds of winning the lottery than in getting into public housing. Some cities have a pipeline for supportive housing through the shelter system, but that does require entering into the generally homeless shelter system, not the DV one. (This can be a real concern as the shelter system is often quite dangerous, especially to women, people with physical disabilities, and people with mental health disabilities.)

Finding roommates is likely the path of least resistance. Lots of people live with roommates and if you find people you get along with, it can be a long term situation. You would need to share your space, but I personally prefer not to live alone."
"I've been mentally disabled my whole life, but only just got diagnosed by a psychologist. What help can I get now as an adult?",0,disability,"Preface: my resources and understanding are US based.

[AskJan](https://askjan.org/) can help you figure out job accommodation. Your local Office of Vocational Rehabilitation can also help you out in figuring out work that you can do with your disabilities. 

If you want to apply for SSI/SSDI, that's with [the Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/). There is a page on their website where you can calculate what you might be paid if you are awarded disability. Marriage can affect SSI payments.

If you need health insurance, you can see what you might be eligible for under the Affordable Care Act in your state. You may or may not need to pay for it. Some states, like Pennsylvania, have carve outs for Medical Assistance for Worker's with Disabilities. Health insurance includes behavioral health coverage. While you wait for health insurance, you may be able to find a therapist who works with a sliding scale or in community health centers. 

You may have a Federally Qualified Health Center near you. They can provide health care (including mental health) if you are uninsured. They will likely have resources to help you access insurance coverage."
Getting housing while disabled but not yet receiving benefits (US),5,disability,"Please consider when and where these comments are appropriate.

I don't have the paperwork on hand, I'd have to look at it. iirc since I can use a computer there seems to be the impression that I could do call center work, data entry, stuff like that. Those things are also out of the question due to my mental health and fibro, I can't keep to a schedule, meet deadlines/quotas etc, I am extremely forgetful and can't focus on work, I struggle to keep up even with video games more complex than shooters.

Till the fact my body couldn't handle feeling like that everyday 

Plus it was messing with my mental health 

I felt like a burden on family for a issue I didn't ask to have.

Like I understand people Houses and if I can't keep a job 

Which I couldn't I tried but always quitted 

So I got kicked out a lot by family and friends of the family 

Which I understand and stuff 

Really Don't Agree With The ""Learned Helplessness"" thing 

I understand it has some valid points 

But I just personally feel like it's a Individualistic approach or judgement 

To someone that is trying to get their situation atleast for my situation 

I was trying to work jobs getting headaches and Panic attacks just being on the phone 

And I worked a lot of public open jobs 

Which I wished people seem my disabilities so they wouldn't call me lazy or such

Or say things like ""Learned Helplessness"" and stuff 

Because I actually was trying to help myself 

Just I can't control the Disability process 

I can't put a gun to nobody head and say approve me for disability in less than a year 

Or tell a job to get me accomodations that actually benefits me and not the business 

It's so easy to go to Jail than actually trying survive in society

But I understand my Family and friends kicking me out 

Wasn't anything personal it's capitalism 

If I can't bring in a profit or benefit individually to a household or someone life.

I'm a burden and I understand that. Can't Force nobody to help you 

And I understand people mental health just taking someone else in 

Or caring for a disabled person 

Even though I didn't ask to have a disability 

But if it's making you comfortable evict them don't feel guilty 

I understand taking care of people with a disability or just anyone is difficult as well 

Atleast for me I didn't get evicted like that 

Atleast in the black community we don't do all that legal stuff 

They just put a Gun out on you or make physical threats to you 

From my experience 

I left the same day 

Remember my uncle making a threat 

That ""My Shit Better be in the Garage By Saturday"" it was a Thursday that week in 2018

Had to Leave unfortunately 

Which I did plus living with people that doesn't want you there 

Is very mentally draining 

I was scared to leave my room

Because I got threats violent threats 

Because I couldn't keep a job 

Just Disability takes years for people 

Especially non invisible disabilities 

So it took years 

I was seeing my Mental health workers 

Which I was in Georgia so I didn't have insurance 

So they kept supplying me with the same medicine that didn't work 

And I couldn't afford to get the new medicine my doctor prescribed 

I understand you have to do what's best for you 

I know I was trying 

Like I felt like I was a burden and unaliving myself at. That time 

Because I didn't want to be a burden 

I hate being a burden on people 

That's why I'm scared to get in relationships with women 

Because my disability is something I'm trying to figure out 

But I didn't ask for this

Feel like Eugenicists want me dead 

Not trying to trigger anyone 

Just your ex situation sounds like my situation 

But you have to do what's best for your mental health 

I didn't take it personal.

Even though it was family members 

That I couldn't reach out to 

Disabilities in my life is just hard 

Just people don't realize saying Learned Helplessness 

They don't realize it's not too much help as you think 

And plus it's a very huge waiting list 

Sometimes years long

Just getting help is not immediate

Just not enough resources 

Especially for a person like me that couldn't keep a stable job 

Which I felt bad I couldn't 

But people wasn't in my body they couldn't see how I was feeling 

Not trying to trigger anyone
At the end of the day, it isn't your responsibility.  They need to make an effort to either get a job or file for SS disability, section 8, food stamps, Medicaid, and find housing.  You didn't indicate what the disability is.  Are you actually caregiving, like feeding, bathing, etc, or just financial?  You're not family.  Even if you were, it's not worth sacrificing your mental health for this.  It sounds like you have your own family in the home as well.  So they're dealing with this as well?

It's very easy for someone with ""learned helplessness"" to give up and just rely on someone else.  My VA therapist introduced me to that term.  It sounds like your ex is experiencing this.  

""In psychology, learned helplessness is a state that occurs after a person has experienced a stressful situation repeatedly. They believe that they are unable to control or change the situation, so they do not try, even when opportunities for change are available."""
D.C. Can’t Dismiss Lawsuit Over Police Response to Mental Health Crises | Attorneys say the district’s practice of sending armed police officers to mental health emergencies violates the Americans With Disabilities Act.,37,disability,"Here is a major problem no one wants to look at regarding these mental health issues.  
A. We don't have enough mental health professionals to begin with for non-emergency issues.  
B. There isn't enough incentive or pay to attract people with the training to law enforcement.  
C. Current law enforcement is not setup to deal with the issue.  
D. In many locations even an Ambulance will not approach or provide help until law enforcement has confirmed an area is clear.  
This is all adding to the problems we have right now. None of this makes it acceptable for law enforcement to be stepping on peoples rights, or killing innocents. And it's the people suffering and in need of help most who are the victims because of it. But until we really look at the most basic building blocks causing the problems, nothing is going to change. Even if we get rid of things like qualified immunity."
“Respectful Disability Communications” in regards to patient care,114,disability,"Exactly. With how varied people’s opinions are, and how many more important issues we have, fussing about terminology just detracts from the real issues. They want to talk about communication with disabled people? Learn to take us seriously when we have problems or concerns. Confront your own biases about disabled people and other marginalized groups. Train medical professionals to communicate with D/deaf and HOH people, cognitively impaired or language impaired people, people in the middle of mental health crises, etc etc. I don’t know, even just work on presenting pain scales in a more accurate way for people with chronic pain! So many things I can think of that would be much more impactful and important, and yet it always comes back to able-bodied people fumbling around the word “disability”."
Anxiety/doubt despite approval,4,disability,"I have LTD through my employer on the basis of mental health. The constant medication changes and having the insurance company monitor my every shit is getting to be too much.

>>It’s like every “you can do it” cheerleader over the course of my life convinced me that I just need to try harder.

I feel this one! Sometimes I think this is all my fault because I'm not trying hard enough.

Although LTD can be a relief, the hoops they make you jump through is like a full time job."
Am I secretly ableist? And if I am how do I change?,19,disability,"I’m disabled and I’m sure I’ve said inappropriate things to other disabled people, it’s just part of being human.. sometimes we put our foot in our mouths! And I’m sure I’ve parked my wheelchair in people’s way in shops, or had my walker in a spot that has annoyed someone - but taking up space in the world means occasionally being in the space someone else wants to enter too. 
You’re human, treat yourself with the same gentleness and compassion you would others, and instead of living with the fear of being ableist try and put that energy into what you could do to assist disabled people (including mental health advocacy) 💜"
Work has my loa request pending and listed me as ineligible for short term disability ,10,disability,"Many short- and long-term disabilities have an exclusion period for pre-existing conditions.   You may want to double check your policy for any exclusions.   If you had a previous mental health diagnosis, they may be treating your current diagnosis as pre-existing, even though it's a result of recent trauma.

I am so very sorry for what you've been going through.  

Your doctor may need to submit additional records to show that your current need for leave is related to the trauma of losing your home and pet, not part of a preexisting diagnosis.  

Also, check to see if your employer has an type of employee assistance programs that may help you out financially.   Also, the Red Cross often has emergency assistance programs for people who lose their homes to fire."
"""You're on disability? Let me guess, depression and anxiety?""",947,disability,"Oh totally - I use a chair, am losing my hearing, but the mental health issues, especially SI are by far the worst bit. Hope you find some peace.
You look so lovely! love your dress, it suits you perfectly!

And thank you for helping me feel validated and less like a fraud. I’m on disability for multiple mental health reasons and sometimes o feel like my family, friends, and doctors look down on me for it but my therapist has been helping me combat that. Mental health issues can be debilitating and dangerous, I’m glad it’s a valid reason for disability even if it’s a hard battle to be approved.
I’m on disability for mental health reasons (panic disorder with agoraphobia). I just wanted to thank you for posting this. Mental health struggles are no less valid or debilitating. It makes me feel a bit less depressed to know that others (like yourself) understand.
Right! Like, I'm disabled for mental health reasons (ive been on it since i was 8) and its not like i just get a little sad and anxious sometimes. i have severe breakdowns when im under any sort of stress to the point that i could not work a full time job, even though i really wish i could!
I hate you Had To go Through with that. Just tired of ignorant Ableist people sometimes 

Yeah Your Reasons For being on Disability is Valid 

Just Made me Also think about my personal experience with people like that 

Like it makes me Very Sad that Some people don't understand 

How Much Non Visible as well as Visible Disabilities effects people 

Well for me I have Severe Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder 

And bipolar disorder and unspecified PTSD, And recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability 

Just get tired Of The Abled body making disability like the Olympics 

Like people have to compete with each other to see if they Disabilities are severe enough for disability 

Which true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function 

Which this does 

Which I have Agoraphobia I'm the opposite I can't Be Around people 

I can't even go to the Hospital without having a panic attack 

like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent 

Because I still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function 

Only time I leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult 

But I live alone don't really have support 

Since I look so Normal and functional unfortunately 

Plus people think because I'm a black man I'm immune to being disabled or having a disability 

Just kinda hard Because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community 

It effects me daily 

It's detrimental on my economic status 

It's hard to just text and talk on the phone 

Even right now I'm getting a headache 

But it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability 

Try to explain to ignorant people that are Ableist like you dealt with 

I'm quite the opposite I can't stay with people I would have a panic attack unfortunately 

It's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis 

Like they force you to share rooms which aggravates my disabilities.

And aggravates my anxiety PTSD symptoms as well 

Just everyones disability effects people differently 

Mines kinda severe to me 

Like Hate the Competition Thing abled body people created 

Sound like people have to compete with each other like freaking capitalism 

Just for Disability payments 

I hate that 

I wouldn't apply for disability if I didn't need it 

I felt so much guilt younger

People saying my disability is not severe because they can't see it 

Or people always assume you faking it 

Since mental illness they quote you can fake 

Which makes me very upset 

Because they will never know how I feel in my body and mind 

If only that knew they wouldn't be saying that 

And by the way Disability payments can't even cover Rent payments 

A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is over 1500$ for the worst area 

So probably pushing 2000$+ for a good area

Just make me upset and triggered 

Because I have no reason to make up how my disability effects my life daily 

People are so ignorant with mental illness 

They assume because I'm laughing at a movie 

Or taking a selfie 

I'm faking a mental illness 

Which makes me upset 

Like My therapist tells me to watch television using coping mechanisms to distract 

Like they don't know people with disabilities don't always have bad days 

Have a bunch of bad days 

Which I do but 

I like doing the coping mechanisms my therapist taught me 

Just make me cry a little 

Because Disabilities people can't understand what they can't see

Not trying to get emotional 

Just your post resonated with my life 

Bought up bad memories I guess 

Like people think because I workout 

Which is at home by the way 

I can't handle public commercial gyms by the way 

But people assume because I'm trying to use a coping mechanism 

To cope with my disability 

That means I'm faking it 

Or using reddit as a journal like now 

Which I'm anxious as well typing this 

Just people don't understand disabilities effect people differently 

Just Ableism in society 

Might not be to abled body person that has no problems leaving their house 

Or a person that doesn't feel like a lion is being chased after him for just talking or talking on a phone 

Like I live alone but my with my disability I couldn't live with people that would make my condition worse 

I had anxiety just living with family members 

Just because I live alone people think my mental health is not severe 

That really makes me upset 

Because Disabilities effects people differently 

Mines just as severe or life altering as anyone else 

Just because I live alone doesn't mean I'm independent 

I still can't keep a job and stuff 

I don't think being independent is until I can live a functioning life 

And people that have jobs still have disabilities 

Disability effects everyone differently 

I hate this grade scale stuff 

That Ableist people use to say you not deserving of help

Just Ableism sigh

Which I tell distant family and Ableist strangers on social media sites 

I don't have to live in a group home unfortunately 

Because my anxiety would get worse and turn to a crisis 

Just I really relate to your post op 

I guess I got triggered by you quoting Ableist people that said that to you 


But hate people feel like mental illness is not taking seriously 

Which I'm not physically disabled which I definitely respect and understand 

But speaking from a Ableist person perspective 

Like they think people with mental illness or other invisible disabilities 

Should not be considered for disability 

And they always say we lazy or faking because we lazy 

Which I would love to keep a stable job 

But capitalism doesn't value that capitalism values efficiency and profit 

And doesn't value disabled people fitting in 

Not trying to rant on capitalism because I know everyone opinions is different 

I would love to work it's just hard with my conditions

Because due to Ableism they really think People getting disability checks 

That doesn't even cover a full month of rent 

Is a luxury.

Which the Lowest paying minimum wage job pays more than disability pays people.

Like This effected me for a long time 

My whole life 

Just because it gets me emotional knowing because you don't see me walking in a cane or wheelchair 

Or a Down Syndrome or something more visible 

Like I don't have those conditions I'm still disabled as them 

Autism you can't see, learning disabilities you can't see

Even some physical illnesses are invisible 

Such as Sickle Cell and Lupus 

Everything is not visible like blindness 

But my mental illness effects my life as much as any other disability effects people lives in society 

Just because I have muscle or tall black and 6'2""

Keep myself groomed 

I guess I have to look unhoused to For people to understand how my disability effects me seriously 

It's so flawed 

Invisible Disabilities doesn't work like that unfortunately 

I'm deserving of disability as much as anyone that has a disability 

Sorry for the rant OP
Absolutely. I'm tired of the nonsense that mental health disabilities are less disabling or acceptable than physical.
Is it typically easier to get on disability via mental health or physical ?"
New job and already discriminated against?,13,disability,Please provide any verified legal evidence of this claim. Because I lived in a two  party consent state and had an attorney tell me the opposite while I was in a workplace discrimination situation. The advice I gave is the advice my attorney gave to me if I ever had a meeting with my superiors or HR.
"What do you do when both partners in a relationship are disabled, and you both need help, but you can't help each other?",24,disability,"I am not saying that it is impossible. It depends on the disabilities the couple has and their severities. You obviously love and care for your partner, that doesn't mean it's healthy. The original info you gave sounded of desperation, this now sounds more like it's all financial, rather than disability related.

I suggested couples therapy in my previous response. Are either or both of you getting therapy individually for your mental health / physical issues? On medications? Have family or friends that can help?

I actively participated in growing up with both of my parents dealing with mental issues struggle through love, hatred, abuse, marriage and divorce, depression, grief, manipulation, neglect, bargaining, drug use, alcoholism, resentment, anxiety, animosity and progressively deteriorating health for nearly 40 years before cutting almost all contact with them both. They were soulmates and life partners too.

Now I struggle dealing with the aftermath after 53 years of being emotionally, mentally and physically abused. My wife has childhood trauma of her own, but no physical impairments. We make it work, but just barely. I am on 100% disability and do bi-weekly psychological therapy. I am in to see my specialists once a month for my physical issues.

We have gone through couples therapy multiple times and barely managed to avoid divorce twice in just over 23 years of being together and married for 16. If it wasn't for being lucky and getting approved for full disability we wouldn't have made it past our fifth year of marriage no matter how much we love and care for each other. It's just too much. 

Any of this sound familiar? I would like nothing more than for things to work out for you and wish you luck. I really do. But it's a crapshoot and two emotionally or mentally broken people rarely stay together in the end. The truth is the percentage is high that it will fail, but I would rather be honest with you than blow smoke up your ass or try and convince you that everything is unicorns and rainbows.
Honestly, none of that sounds familiar. We don't take it out on each other, we don't fight or use drugs to cope, we don't hurt each other. We also are a gay couple who doesn't want kids. So we aren't abusing or neglecting any kids. 

It's all connected, disability, financial, mental health. Because of disability and mental health, he's been having to take more time off work. Now my physical and mental health is getting so bad I have to take time off work. Our mental health is getting even worse due to financial stress and our failing bodies, 

I'm desperate to find a way for both of us to get the care we need and stay together, as well as be able to afford things like rent and groceries. 

As for your questions, we are doing our best. I have a therapy appointment next week (but I've been struggling to get that set up due to my therapist not having availability, so I'm about a month behind),  I've got a doctor's appointment to go over the migraine I've been having in 2 weeks, and an mri next month. My medication list is 3 pages long if you count non pill related things like needles, glucomoleter, inhaler, etc.  Healthcare is just sometimes sporadic and takes a while. He's got therapy next week, and I'm trying to urge him to see a doctor for his leg. We're doing thr best we can."
"For those with narcissistic and very abusive parents, did they make your disability a show and tell piece?",40,disability,"I'm sorry you experienced all of that from your mother. 

Not personally. My mother sided with doctors who said chronic illness stuff was just mental health."
Migraine disorder,3,disability,"I’m also autistic and have severe chronic migraines. They got really bad when I turned 26 (literally had my first full blown vestibular migraine on my birthday.) I had to put my whole life on hold. I had to pretty quickly go onto shots as a treatment option too because of medications for my mental health. They shots definitely helped a lot. I’m now on an infusion every three months instead which is a stronger version of the shots. 

Migraine is a lot to deal with. I definitely understand where you’re coming from."
Has anyone here suffered from MASSIVE imposter syndrome after being recognised as a disabled person?,28,disability,"I also have mental health conditions and constantly question myself. If other people with bipolar and generalized anxiety are out there thriving, it must be because I'm a phony and have to try harder.

I don't know how to get rid of these feelings but I relate 🫂"
My thoughts on ....,7,disability,The constant stress kf being in never ending severe pain is enough to driving anybody over the edge...I get angry too...it's like being tortured non stop...my mental health has deminished greatly ...if I didn't the help I needed I would definitely be dead again or in prison.
My physical health is taking a massive toll on my mental health ,28,disability,"Have you been diagnosed with a medical condition? This sounds very much like the autoimmune neuromuscular disease that I have (Myasthenia Gravis). It took me a very long time to get diagnosed because I am seronegative (don't have the antibodies for it). Being undiagnosed and very ill also took a big toll on my mental health, but I am doing much better now! Please don't give up!"
"Lincoln Financial STD ""Initial Phone Interview""?",2,disability,"Are you seeing a mental health professional for PPD? They can submit support as well. Otherwise make sure you submit the information from the OB's office in writing. If they deny the claim, request a claim file, consult a lawyer in CA, and appeal on a timely basis."
would you consider an ED a (partially) physical disability?,21,disability,"I was on SSDI for my anorexia as an adult in my 20s for medical/physical reasons. not mental health. Got approved almost instantly. 

Now im 35 and no longer recovering-- have a SEED of 23 years now-- and on SSDI for completely different reasons (albeit probably caused in part by my ED, but I no longer tell medical providers about my ED and don't have a treatment team any longer).
Eating disorders are mental illnesses and they can lead to physical illnesses but I would not equate having anorexia to having Multiple Sclerosis. Feels like comparing apples to oranges in my opinion.
But I wouldn’t be so concerned what others consider a disability as in a lot of ways that’s subjective, what might be disabling for me might not really bother you. 

Reading this breaks my heart though , I’m praying that you’re in mental health care on a regular basis and that you have encouraging and supportive people around you. Focus on healing your mind so your body may follow.
Yeah, but applications for those things require way more than actually having a disability, you have to prove that it's disabling to the level that you cannot cater for a lot of things. Some mental illnesses can be classified as such, but most are not. Nonetheless, many discussions are addressing mental illnesses as disabilities.

The boundary you are trying to set between mental/physical is a bit hard as well, depression can impair your physical abilities, but it is pretty much on a cognitive level. EDs can make you physically weak/sick, but it is also pretty much about treating your mental condition. In my opinion, all mental disabilities can affect your physical health because we are not disconnected. In the same way, physical disabilities can impair your mental health."
