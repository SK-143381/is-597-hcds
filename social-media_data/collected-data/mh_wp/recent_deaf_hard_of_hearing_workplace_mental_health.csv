Without knowing the personalities involved, my overall recommendation would to not personalize the conflict as much as possible. The heart of any collective organizing effort is respectful communication, after all; people don’t have to like one another or have meshing personalities. Rather, they have to be able to put their differences aside and put the common good of the union first. The boss campaign is all about trying to have respectful communication, raising strategic issues in a thoughtful way, and helping mobilize others towards shared goals — in a word, solidarity. Nothing wins like supermajority solidarity, and nothing kills a union faster than itself when that breaks down. Demonstrating that good faith organizing helps set you apart from more toxic personalities, too, when the organizing hits more intense periods.

In this circumstance, though, have you identified any natural leaders in your workplace? It's possible, given that it appears to have many shifts and a somewhat dispersed workforce, that there are few, or maybe zero, people who are leaders across the whole workplace. In that case, the next best step is to identify what leaders there are, bearing in mind that leaders aren’t always the smartest or the loudest or the most outspoken, but those who, when they do speak, are listened to and followed. If you can identify those people and connect with them, you'll have a fighting chance."

",7,raisedbynarcissists,if you have a legit option to move in with a friend then DO IT. you are an adult. you may not feel like one but you have the same rights as an adult. so take advantage of it!! it will be hard and anxiety inducing but incredibly beneficial for your mental health and self worth. it will be a life changing experience you will always feel proud of. some student debt is not going to hurt you. staying in this environment is actively hurting you. if your mom is truly abusing you like this she needs to feel life without the option of seeing her child. you guys need separation.
I am unable to help my DV victim sibling. What should I do?,1,Advice,"Your brother is an adult (I assume) and, unless you can legally prove him to be incapable of making his own decisions, is responsible for the decisions he makes. If you witness actual domestic abuse I’d call the police. And tell him you will do so if she threatens him or anyone else in the house. Let her know that, too. Consider an intervention with him and try to convince him he needs to get away from her and offer solutions. Suggest he get therapy to gain the strength to deal with the situation. Also protect your own mental health and if things get too toxic consider leaving. Do what you can but the hard work is up to him."
Feeling the Rage,2,antiwork,"dont let it bother you, not one bit. The workplace is like this. Its very unfortunate, but most companies try to pay everyone less. Most companies are alpha male driven, focused on greed. It's the ugly truth of commerce. Glad you can see it, most people will not admit to it, some will just tune it out and paint a pretty picture, or not believe it. Its a fact and you know it is. Some companies out there are more mature and advanced, and they are very  mindful of this and they wont do that. They are rare exceptions. But I wouldn't let this ruin your day, rather, here is a powerful choice you have. What I do daily is try to contribute positivity and good will wherever I can, and I try to be an example of higher values, of consideration, of listening, of supporting and enabling, of acceptance, of unconditional love. I have created a sphere of love and it feels great. I may run into people like this, and it becomes an opportunity for me to show them another way, show them what they are missing, indirectly, through my love and kindness. This is the power you have, you can use this to change the world, it may not spread across the globe, but wherever you go, you will be able to lift and teach and heal people by bringing love to bear. Love is non gender based, its not culture or political based, its all pervasive and feels good. So i create it and give it. 

You may think this is stupid, and doesn't make sense, and you have a sense of fighting this, and doing something else. You are free to do that, the world has been fighting itself for ages. We are still as ignorant as ever. You don't fight this, this is a way of life that is non confrontational. This is a way that creatse an atmosphere of good humanity, we are the one s that have to bring it to bear. Because it is not out there, but it is in here, inside us, its in you, and because it is, It goes where I go and where you go, and it destroys ignorance."

[New Updates]: WIBTA for divorcing my wife for accusing me of cheating on her?,3483,BestofRedditorUpdates,"This is awful. So glad of his relationship with Maya. At least they’re able to support each other. The accusations are sick. What horrible people they all are. It’s horrible what the wife posted on Facebook. IMHO it’s all a combination of religiously insanity, mental health and pure evil.
If you google things like, ""hallucinations varying by culture"" you'll get interesting results, including some from various scientific journals. Most of what I've read is that it's really hard to measure because different cultures have such different approaches to mental health and understanding of what, exactly, constitutes a hallucination. I'm not sure if this sub allows links so hopefully this is enough direction to get you to good sources!

Toxic Positivity: The Anime (A Your Lie In April Pitch Meeting),137,CharacterRant,"Character Rants that I can hear in my head are tight!

That said, you hit pretty much perfectly on all the issues I have with it. Although I don't think it's ""toxic positivity"" so much as just bad writing and everything being justified as ""For his own good"". It's very patronising, honestly.

Even the stuff with his mother is portrayed as if he needed to grow up and understand it was all his own fault and for his good, he's not a kid now and so he can apologise for misunderstanding her. The series 100% straightfaced believes that his mother was not only justified, but morally pure. And that's wild to me.

EDIT:

>she admits that she put her wants above Kousei's mental health, and she admits she probably shouldn't have kept beating up a child abuse victim. She knew what she was doing was wrong from the beginning, but she apologizes and that's what matters.

Pretty sure that never happens. She only apologises for the lie about her being into Watari."
AITAH & an awful daughter-in-law for not accommodating my mother-in-law? ,12,okstorytime,"NTA if your husband won't cut the cord with his mommy and put his family first, your marriage isn't going to last. 

I mean you've been off and in for how long before you decided to get married? Is this really the environment you want your children raised in? Your MIL popping in whenever she wants disrupts your sons routine, which upsets him and throws him off. With your son needing his routine your husband is disregarding what's best medically for your son, as well as what's best for his mental health. At what point will you explode? 

You really need to have a come to jesus talk with your husband about his mother. He needs to get it through his head that he chose you. He chose to start a family with you, not his mother. He chose to marry you, not his mother. He chose to have kids with you, not his mother. DH needs to start putting the well-being of his family over his mommy's fee-fees. DH isn't the one responsible for MIL's emotional regulation. MIL is responsible for that. DH needs to stop trying to coddle MIL and damn his family. His family suffers every time he refuses to set a boundary with his mother. There's no reason MIL needs to just show up without and invitation. MIL doesn't need to show up during the work week at all. Definitely not during the school week. Going forward you expect DH to tell MIL that she needs to ask to come over first and not just show up. If she does just show up, you want him to send her away. MIL should be in a timeout for all the boundary stomping she's done. But until your husband opens his eyes to see the manipulation and disrespect nothing will change. 

You've had these talks before so you know that.nothing will change. You may need to give you husband an ultimatum if this needs to change or I will have to divorce you to protect the youngest due to their autism."

Employee Assistance provide wellbeing mental health sessions when someone goes off ill due to burnout, stress, discrimination, harassment etc.

It's a purely liability grift, because when you raise grievances they will argue that night is day and black is white, and that it's all in your head, even when presented with irrefutable evidence, and you either return to the grinder, or quit.

So I posed the question: if someone cut me with a razor, bandaged it, cut me again, bandaged it, and cut me again, and bandaged it, would any reasonable person or Judge in the world consider that to be assistance, or *torture*?
Apparently a “harmonious workplace” is a goal, so, fire the manager - goal achieved, carry on as normal.
What an idiotic take. 

You say it would be hugely impractical as there are thousands of employees across the globe and some pass away everyday, I would argue that it is very much practical and I've seen it happen where I work. I'm also perplexed by the insensitivity of this statement.

Is it so hard for the regional head/fellow colleague/manager/someone who hase been working with her in the oas few months to spend few minutes perhaps once or twice a year to pay respects to a colleague who died? 

As someone who worked in an organisation with 10000+ employees across India, it was common place to support your colleagues with their personal struggles when needed. I carried my manager through server illness when his family was not there, and was shown the same kindness during Covid, where I would receive multiple calls everyday to ensure I have everything I needed since I was isolated and was living away from my family. I could not imagine missing a funeral of someone close to me. This takes a lot lesser time than you think. Not everyone has to go but at least one or two people working with Anna should have. 

How would I assure that funerals of the employees that pass are attended? I hope I never have to work in a place so devoid of humanity, where I have to monitor, whether this bare minimum social obligation is fulfilled. People not attending funeral of their colleague points to deeper cultural and organisational issues within the firm. In my opinion, taking action to ensure funerals are being attended would be more of a symptomatic treatment. 

One thing I would look into would be to make sure that we are hiring people with high EQ and empathy in general. This would be a long term measure. A short term measure can be to have subordinate's work satisfaction tied to manager's KPI. This will reduce exploitation in workplace and will help support a more humane work culture.

Honestly, It's hard for me to imagine that people need to be taught this, but partners may be called out in high level meeting, in front of their counterparts as their department failed to show basic empathy to someone working in their team. They might not be directly responsible, and I know this might seem emotionally immature, but fear of having a negative impression on the management, which may result in professional stagnation is just about the motivators for partners in these firms. Not saying that partners themselves should go, but someone in the team should, and a fear or reprimand would help the partner prioritise this.
I think this is a cultural/regional thing. 

Where I live, it's a little rude if you don't attend the wake or shiva of a colleague's family member. So much so that company wide emails with wake info in a workplace with hundreds are not just commonplace but expected. There are people who keep it to just a family goodbye, and in that case, the family's wishes are respected. However, if they're holding hours of any sort, it's socially important that you go to the wake. Especially if you worked closely or were in that person's department. Have a good excuse if you miss it. No one would act outright offended, but some people might actuallt be hurt. The funeral service is a little more personal, not expected, but still not at all odd to net a complete to dozens of colleagues. 

I'm an atheist from a very secular family that  doesn't do wakes or funerals, and yet I've been to so, so many wakes for people I don't know at all.

Yes, this cultural expectation means you also get invited to the baby showers and the weddings and all that. It's exhausting.
That's not the situation in the article though. This was the deceased's co-workers. Depending on tenure it would be likely that a nontoxic workplace would have people show at the funeral as friends. Certainly there was a few people from various places my dad worked at his funeral, going back to the late 70s and 80s
Depending on your workplace… your colleagues actually see more of you on a daily basis than your own family so it’s not weird that some of then want to say goodbye"
What happens when you have an incompetent PR team ,975,developersIndia,"Very chatGPT-esque, including words like “Champion this objective”. I asked ChatGPT to write a similar apology note and it reads awfully similar to this PR garbage:

As the Chairman of EY, here is an apology post you could issue regarding the tragic death of Anna Sebastian:

It is with profound sadness and a heavy heart that I address the untimely passing of Anna Sebastian Perayil, a bright and dedicated member of our team. As a father myself, I am deeply grieved by her loss and extend my sincerest condolences to Anna’s parents and loved ones during this incredibly painful time.

We deeply regret missing Anna’s funeral, which goes against the very values and culture we strive to uphold at EY. This is an unprecedented failure on our part, and I assure you that it will never happen again. We are committed to doing everything in our power to support her family and honor her memory.

While no words can alleviate the grief her family is enduring, I want to emphasize that we take the concerns raised about our work culture seriously. The well-being of our employees has always been our top priority, and we are actively taking steps to review and enhance our workplace practices to ensure that such a tragedy does not occur again. 

In these difficult moments, we are working closely with Anna’s family, offering them our unwavering support, and continuing an open dialogue on how we can prevent such heartbreak in the future. I vow to personally champion a healthy and balanced work environment for all, ensuring that the well-being of our people remains our highest priority.

Help with being a better hinge/dealing with meta who doesn't like me.,10,polyamory,"Start by dating yourself just as much as you are dating either of them. Every third night? is a night for yoruself. Go to bed when you want, do what you want. Have time to ground and have friends, or have down time, or get your life stuff done. You need to make time for yourself and your partner's should want to support that. Even if it means they lose some time. Your mental health is fundamental to being a good partner. They should value it as much as you do. 

  
Paul kinda sounds like an ass in all this. He is the experienced poly person and yet is ignoring how hanging out with Kate makes you feel. He's not listening to you when you explain it clearly and he guilts and shames you into spending time around someone who is rude to you and when you can't actually be spending close time with Paul. That's pretty uncomfortable for a LOT of reasons.  

  
I would try and create some boundaries and see if he can respect them. ""Paul if we are sharing time together I want to be able to be partners. I don't need to make out with you in front of Kate but I need it to feel comfortable to hold hands, hug or talk to each other. If that isn't something we can do I want to limit my time around Kate. You say you want more time with me but then plan our time together in ways that means we don't actually get that time together.""

  
I have my doubts about Paul's ability to hinge with respect and care. That's some pretty yucky treatment and some really bad listening.
Hi u/NewLifePhase thanks so much for your submission, don't mind me, I'm just gonna keep a copy what was said in your post. Unfortunately posts sometimes get deleted - which is okay, it's not against the rules to delete your post!! - but it makes it really hard for the human mods around here to moderate the comments when there's no context. Plus, many times our members put in a lot of emotional and mental labor to answer the questions and offer advice, so it's helpful to keep the source information around so future community members can benefit as well.

Here's the original text of the post:

Hi all! This will be long, my apologies. I'm new to being a hinge and wanted some advice on how to balance myself and two partners along with how to address one of my partners as a hinge in his own relationships. TLDR at the bottom.

Me (f25)
John (m24)
Paul (m27)
Kate (f31)
Henry (m31)

Quick history on the dynamics for better understanding. Earlier this year I ended my LTR with John and started dating Paul who is polyamorous. I'm insecure but I'm trying my best. The break up did not have to do with Paul. John moved out but ended finding work in our hometown and I allowed him to move back in where we started dating again. Paul and John know I am polyamorous and am dating both of them. Paul and John do not particularly like one another but are being nice for my sake. I'm not forcing them to be in each other's company unless both parties are ok with it. I've made it clear to both of them that they can leave if they are unhappy/uncomfortable. I will not break up with one of them if the other asks, it's not fair to me or the other party, this is also clear information to John and Paul. Paul is also the one who suggested I could be polyamorous with both him and John.

Here's where I need advice; how do I balance two partners, my job, and honestly myself? John and Paul both say I'm not giving them enough time, I barely sleep and I feel like I'm drowning. I want them to both know I'm here for them and care for them, but they both have voiced complaints of not enough me time. I live with John so I literally see him about everyday and will forgo sleep to take him out. I see Paul about every other day and will forgo sleep to spend time at his house or go out with him. Paul is afraid I'm going to go back to mono with John and I keep trying to reassure him but it falls on deaf ears.

I also need help on how to better communicate that I feel left out on group activities that involve Paul and his girlfriend Kate. I literally have to act like Paul and I aren't dating when the three of us are out. Paul and I won't hold hands, will keep an arms distance between us and try not to talk one on one because Kate will become uncomfortably standoffish. I try to talk to her but she won't speak to me and Paul insists I should go on these outings with them. I get along with Kate's husband Henry just fine, we talk and banter and he treats me like a part of the group. It's awkward and draining and I'm not sure if Paul is not reassuring Kate or what is going on there. I don't know if I should bring this to her directly or to Paul. Kate was initially fine with me but as Paul and I got more serious these cold behaviors towards me began. Also, if I decline going out with them Paul says I'm a flake or not trying and I have to give up some, what should be fun, experiences ie: festivals, concerts, movies. I've tried to tell Paul I feel left out but it feels like he doesn't hear me. Paul will also go out of his way to make time for Kate and expects me to just be available so it feels like I'm sacrificing more of my time and wellbeing to see him and it's causing a bit of jealousy on my end.

It's becoming exhausting. I feel like I can't keep my head above water and that no matter how hard I'm trying someone is unhappy with me. I just want to love and be loved but this is taking a toll on my mental health.

TLDR: I'm trying to be a good partner to both my boyfriends but they both feel like it's not enough. One of my boyfriend's girlfriend doesn't like me to the point I don't want to be alone with him and her, and I'm unsure how to discuss this with him.

Please be gentle but constructive, I feel beat up as is but really want to make this work.


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/polyamory) if you have any questions or concerns.*
I just want to say.

John is an adult man. So is Paul. It is *okay* for them to be disappointed sometimes. That is not a big problem you need to fix. If John and Paul need more robust social lives, they can pull on their big boy pants and go make friends. That is a problem *only they* can fix. You are not in charge of managing their mental health or making sure they never have any bad feelings."
Idk how to talk to my husband anymore,24,SchizoFamilies,"It sounds like you're doing all of the right things. Each situation is different and there is no magic answer. 


In my relationship, setting boundaries helps to keep me from getting pulled under. Differentiate between the things that you are able to make better and the things that you are not. 


Let go of the feelings that that are exhausting you. Now that you know you can't force him to take medication or therapy, then it sounds like it's time to relieve yourself of responsibility for those things. Think of some of his symptoms in terms of a person who is paralyzed and in a wheelchair. No amount of intervention on your part is going to get him to stand up and walk. Instead, you find ways to help him where he is. 


If you don't create boundaries like this, then instead of one victim of his illness, there will be two and he will have lost his partner and best supporter. Find boundaries that help preserve your self-esteem, your energy, and your own mental health. That will keep you most able to help him when things shift and he has moments of willingness to seek treatment, and moments of awareness of how he can modify his behavior so that the symptoms of his illness don't hurt the people around him as much.
I understand why patients are so against inpatient care. Some facilities can be quite a traumatizing experience for them. But sometimes, getting them out of their usual surroundings is better for them. Less triggers and temptations of taking unnecessary substances. 

Unfortunately we live in an area where mental healthcare quality is mediocre. Seeing a psychiatrist takes months! 

I hope things get better for you ❤️"
We're forgetting a vital detail: Andrew was just 14.,70,AndrewGosden,"I’ve got a little cousin who’s 12 and he told me that all the kids in his year talk about mewing (a way of creating a false jawline by putting your tongue on the roof of your mouth?), mogging (being more attractive than your friend) and various redpill/andrew Tate garbage. All I can say is I’m surprised more young boys aren’t trying to “escape” in the same way as AG did, as it must be relentless and terrible for their mental health."
how did you make the decision to get/not to get hearing aids as an adult? (mini vent),3,deaf,"I have been HoH my whole life (28F) and got hearing aids two years ago. It did change my life. For a long time, I just didn’t think I “needed” them. But it was very isolating and anxiety-inducing being left out of conversations at home and in public, not to mention how exhausting it was to try and keep up with conversations I couldn’t hear. There’s also a lot of research on HAs and brain health (minimizes risk of dementia), so that alone is a big factor for me too since my hearing is progressively getting worse. 

As for the internalized ableism, your family, and the stubbornness: I’m sorry your family hasn’t been supportive of your other disabilities. I had to learn how to be my own advocate over the years. I feel that I am still learning too. After I got HAs, I followed a bunch of Deaf advocates online. You can have HAs and still continue learning ASL.They have really nice ones that are very discreet. I work with children and families as a mental health therapist, and almost all of my families have never noticed my HAs.

Good luck to you ❣️
My mom is the only family I’m connected to, I’m estranged from my dad (who raised me), my sisters, and his entire side of the family for various reasons. There was a period of time where I was no contact with my mom but for the past year and a half we’ve been trying to rebuild our relationship. I feel like I can’t get her to work on all of the issues at once (queerness, gender, class, disability) so I’m taking it one step at a time. I have boundaries for my mental health’s sake, but it is hard to know when to continue holding on to a relationship if it’s holding me back from doing things that are positive for me.

I’m definitely going to bring this up in therapy, would love to find someone who is well versed in navigating this experience but right now I’m still “shopping” around for therapists so we’ll see."
Whys Life is hard ,3,Mental_Wellness_Care,"I’m really sorry you’re facing all this. It sounds incredibly challenging, especially with your mental health and physical issues. It’s important to take care of yourself first, even if that means delaying things like college. Try to get support from mental health professionals who can understand your needs and communicate in a way that works for you. If you’re struggling with anxiety and isolation, reaching out to support groups or online communities might help you feel less alone.

WIBTA for divorcing my wife for accusing me of cheating on her?,1987,BORUpdates,"Tbh it sounds like she's having a mental health crisis. She's been raised in and then rejoined a cult. Sane people don't do that. She's blown up her entire life with this shit, takes no responsibility for her part and alienated her own child. Putting 'Christian' on it doesn't make it not a cult. 

Obviously she can't be committed as she's not literally psychotic, but she's far from psychologically healthy.

If she's being abusive to the husband and daughter then let her scream into the void. Maybe she'll find her way out again, maybe not. It's up to her.
I'm not convinced this isn't a medical thing. Not to suggest that this marriage is in any way salvageable, but this seems bigger than delving back into a cult. She had to be in a state where a suggestion of cheating with his step-daughter would take footing, which a healthy brain would be able to see for what it is, I believe.

I had an illness that affected my mental health massively. Never went this far with it, am still married, thankfully, but it would have been an understandable choice if he had left me. It was auto-brewery syndrome. In the end, I asked for the anti-fungals that 'cured' it, not knowing that it would happen. Just thought I had oral thrush. No doctors looked for auto-brewery syndrome, it was an accidental discovery. After those meds, I had my life back, it happened FAST. It took a month for the adrenaline to wear off. I could see all that I had done as a mom and wife, and I am still processing that guilt. 

At my worst my memory was shot. I couldn't transpose more than three digits at a time. I couldn't carry a conversation AND drive safely at the same time. My memories felt drunk, despite no alcohol. My symptoms  list was long, but I largely attributed it all to genetics, lack of sleep, and just being odd. It wasn't until the cloud was lifted that I realized what had happened. When I would talk about everything, people would tell me it was a normal part of being a parent. It was not. 

Point being, if something like this is happening, I doubt any doctor would be looking for it. It fucks with you and is invisible. My brain is still recovering. I had only listed to one musical artist for more than a decade. I couldn't stomache anything else, and then a few months ago, it went away. I am enjoying other music! 

I doubt anybody has the same symptoms if this is the case, it would probably depend on the area of your brain that is getting the most damage. But her going off the deep end like this feels familiar and makes me feel uncomfortable. 

If she starts having other acute medical problems, like seizures, this could very well be what is going on. I believe  mine would have evevtually killed me, and I doubt the doctors would have caught it. I had started to say goodbye to the important people in my life, believing I was going to die, and I couldn't see how messed up that was because it came on so slowly. My brain was fucked, and it turned me into a monster. 

I think OP should be open to a medical issue. It might not be there, but the crazy he is describing feels familiar.
It's crazy how many people don't recognize a psychotic break when it smacks them in the face. People who depart from reality don't look like monsters, they sound and look like themselves, things just don't add up. All the things he mentioned are things that psychotic people do. There are so very many elements of this story that point to a psychotic break and I just feel so sorry for this woman that the person who was supposed to know her and care about her the most in the world was happy to just let her go when she started acting weird. I feel sorry for him too, but I really think that he knows better deep down than to think that she went running back to her family. This must be more confusing for the kid than anyone else. People act as though we're fine without a mental health system in this country, but this is exactly what it looks like when things go too far, it's a depth charge to the lives of so many people overnight.
I think she’s profoundly emotionally immature, and never put the effort into growing or healing that her STBX did. I get that growth is hard, but she also had a supportive partner who wanted to help her and make sure she had resources for her mental health. At that point, it’s down to who she has chosen to be.
Hell, getting her in front of a judge for the divorce might be the only way to actually get her help if she is, in fact, having a mental health crisis that doesn't involve physical harm.
""if you just ignore every single relationship she's had crashing and burning and all the unhinged shit she saying she's totally normal""

Much less she's already taking time off work for church meetings. Her work is an environment fueling her delusions thanks to her cousin AND we likely aren't been getting the fully story of the rest of her life bc 1) she won't tell her husband and 2) her husband is staunchly refusing to acknowledge that she could be having some sort of mental health crisis.
Bro mental health is not your fault but it is your responsibility. 

I agree that ill wish are hardly ever called for, but it’s foolish to act as if grace is innocent here. The unfortunate reality is that hurt people hurt people. Behind most malicious actions you will find an individual who also a victim at some point."

Whenever I go cex I'm always kind and sweet to the staff.. I have the belief of no matter what job or home it is.. you never know what's going on behind the scenes.

Sadly I see alot of people especially Kids fresh out of school wanting to work at CEX because they probably think they can talk games all day.

Many Years ago when I was fresh out of school and I volunteered at a certain Charity shop..I have mental health issues and knee problems.. I'm a plus size woman having to climb up and down the stairs most of the day..I was hard working and kind but a little quiet...the manager came in from time to time and when she did I felt she always targeted me.. when she wasn't here..everyone (roughly 3-5 of us depending on the day) worked fast and well sorting donations to be put out to be sold..we could have a laugh while working which made the day faster.. but when SHE was in.. the mood felt tense.. the manager seemed like one of those 2 faced people..when she was in the shop..she'd come in to the sorting room(it was a small shop..upstairs had a sorting room, kitchen and toilet)  and she'd sit at the desk where everyone was working...she spent all her time on her mobile phone doing nothing relating to work and she answered the wall phone from time to time.. but with me I needed a moment to catch my breath after walking up those steps after so many times..considering I walk to and from work..I didn't take bus due to panic attacks I couldn't handle then..everyone was slim but that woman talked to me like crap.. I once sat down because my feet and bad knee were hurting and I needed a moment to catch my breath on a hot day.. she looks at me and says ""(my name) why aren't you working?""... I explained and she didn't look pleased.  Eventually one day she was a cow to me saying a certain anon volunteer says they caught me constantly on my phone..I wasn't on my phone..only time I was on my phone was during breaks and to make sure it didn't fall out my pocket.. we didn't have lockers..all coats and bags were put in the kitchen..I didn't trust no one... when the anon volunteer told the manager the BS.. she pretty much was horrible to me
.but since the BS with the Anon volunteer..I snapped and decided to quit. I didn't mind volunteering till manager was on site.. then after the phone BS stuff I felt so depressed, I felt like I trusted no one and I got sick of being treated poorly...I told myself I didn't deserve this crap and quit.. I didn't have a backbone then... Eventually that charity shop closed and is now an Indian restaurant 

Few years later I volunteered at my local job centre.. I had to sign people In by paper.. most days were boring..I had the choice of job search for something to do which I did from time to time when the pcs were free and not many people were coming in..my manager there sat next to me with a divider between us.. oh I hated her more than my charity shop manager.. another person targeting me..with how talked to me and the other volunteers was different..she treated me a little poorly too.. one day I was really upset as my grandad had died.. the heartless cow didn't care and wouldn't give me a new bus pass like she said she would because I was 1 or 2 minutes late for work when I try to walk fast as I can .. at that point I wanted to cry.. then this one really peed me and my mum off.. I was suffering from sickness and diarrhoea and I was feeling extremely weak(its rare i get sick).. she heartless cow wanted me to come in to work.. my mother and I agreed for me to not to go in.. few days later when I was better both ends I tried to go to volunteering at the job centre.. I got to the end of my street very weak till I called my mum saying I'm coming home..I couldn't cope.. so I went home..manager wasn't pleased..then another day I was feeling a little stronger.. I  went in to work on a bad day..it was on a jobs fair.. I spent all afternoon on my feet feeling weak like I could collapse anytime.. I survived but in the end that Manager left..and I was happier.. 

I currently have a backbone now a days but I'm still looking for a job but lesson I've learnt us.. never work with the public...and I hate most people."
I can’t ,424,travisandtaylor,"Currently dealing with my little girl being in patient because of lack of mental health professionals in our area. If she is shitting on people with mental health issues she can go directly to hell
Ever since it was announced that Taylor is related to her, they’ve ran w it and so has Taylor. As someone who struggles deeply w MI, I hate her and her stans for infantilizing it. That’s why I stay off of Twitter. It’s not worth sacrificing my mental health esp fighting w brain dead swifties
I didn’t even know that was said about them being “related” … oh man no wonder… I thought it was just cause of the album title. How much do you want to bet she made up that “fact”👀

On a side note, I hope this doesn’t sound weird coming from a stranger, but I’m really proud of you! Mental health is one hell of a b\*\*\*\* and you’re a badass for taking care of yourself and continuing to push through everyday! I hope this is okay I’m saying this given i never know what to say and always afraid of saying the wrong thing, but I just wanted to let you know I hear you and I see you! As someone who is dealing with severe medical issues myself I just want you to know you’re not alone and if you need to vent or talk don’t hesitate okay. I know how hard it is to hear well meaning comments like “I hope you feel better” when people don’t understand the gravity of what you’re dealing with, but truly I’m proud of you! One day at a time right!!

fnd can be affected by your mental health, of course, but so can things like parkinson’s and heart disease

Worried about making a complaint to my union?,6,AFSCME,"Hi there,
 Union Rep here:

I’m really sorry to hear about what you’re going through—it sounds incredibly stressful, and no one should have to feel this way in their workplace. It’s important to remember that you do have options, and even though there are no guarantees, taking action is better than sitting back and hoping things will improve on their own.

First, I encourage you to reach out to your union, even if it feels daunting. It’s possible that your rep might not be as visible right now, but they’re there to advocate for you and support you in situations like this. If you’re not sure who your rep is, try contacting your local AFSCME office or HR for that information. It’s worth a shot—especially when it comes to things like not having representation during your Performance Enhancement meeting, which should have been available to you if you’d asked. 

I understand the fear of retaliation, but remember that retaliation is illegal, and your union is there to help ensure your rights are protected. That being said, not every issue can be solved perfectly through the union. Sometimes, resolutions take time, and there aren’t always quick fixes. But you really only have two options:

	1.	Do nothing and hope things change, which probably won’t happen.
	2.	Work through the union, voice your concerns, and at least try to make things better. While the outcome isn’t guaranteed, it’s better than doing nothing and hoping for a change that might never come.

Even if the process doesn’t resolve everything immediately, bringing up your issues helps set the stage for addressing them. Plus, you’re not alone—if others have left and faced similar challenges, your voice adds to a larger narrative that the union can address more effectively.

Most importantly, your mental health is crucial, and no job should make you feel the way you’re feeling right now. Don’t hesitate to get the help you need, both professionally and within your union, to find a way forward. I really hope you find the support and relief you deserve.

Take care, and wishing you the best,"
Best basic signs to learn for deaf roommate?,9,deaf,"Hey a bit outside of topic, what’s the benefit of someone with mental health related issues living in a disability residence. I’m curious and want to educate myself a bit more"
AITAH - because I want to almost sever contact with toxic family ,11,AITAH,"It sounds like you are in a tough situation with difficult family dynamics. I think what's most important is to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. It's not easy to set boundaries and stand up for yourself, especially when it involves family, but it's crucial for your own happiness and well-being. And don't worry about being the ""asshole"" in this situation, because sometimes you have to do what's best for you even if it may not please everyone else. Hang in there and take care of yourself and your 8 year old. Sending love and support your way.
NTAH - It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, especially during a high-risk pregnancy. Don't let anyone bring you down, even if it's family. Surround yourself with positivity and supportive friends, and don't be afraid to set boundaries. As for your son, it's great that his grandmother is supportive of his autism journey, but make sure to prioritize your own well-being first.
Definitely NTAH (Not the A\*\*hole Here). It's completely understandable to want to cut off toxic family members, especially for the sake of your mental health and wellbeing. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and set boundaries, regardless of what your family may think. And kudos to your fiancé for being a supportive partner. Stay strong and keep taking care of yourself!
First of all, I'm sorry for all the challenges you're facing. It sounds like you have a lot going on and it's great that you're seeking help and support. As for your situation with your grandmother, it's important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. If that means limiting contact with her or setting boundaries, then that's what you have to do. It's not worth sacrificing your own happiness for someone else who is causing you stress. And it's great that your fiancé is supportive and encouraging you to make decisions that are best for you. Just remember, it's okay to put yourself first.
NTA - Toxic family members can be draining and harmful to one's mental health. It's understandable that you want to limit contact with your dad's mother, especially for the sake of your high risk pregnancy and your 8 year old with autism. You are not obligated to continue a relationship with someone who does not respect your boundaries and makes you feel bad about yourself. Take care of yourself and your family first, and don't feel guilty for setting boundaries. Your fiance is right, it's your choice and you should do what's best for your well-being. Hang in there and stay strong.
Honestly, it sounds like cutting contact with your toxic family is the best option for your mental health. It's important to prioritize yourself and your well-being, especially during a high-risk pregnancy. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for putting yourself and your family first. Keep standing your ground and keep setting those boundaries. You got this, mama!
NTA - It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, especially during a high-risk pregnancy. It's okay to set boundaries with toxic family members, and it's great that your fiancé is supportive of your decisions. Keep taking care of yourself and your son, and don't let anyone guilt you into maintaining a relationship with someone who isn't good for your mental health. Maybe try distancing yourself from her and limiting contact as much as possible. And remember, it's never too late to let go of toxic relationships for the sake of your own well-being. Take care and good luck!
Sounds like you may need a ""No Drama, No Grandma"" policy. Set boundaries and stick to them, even if it means limiting contact with your toxic family. Your mental health and well-being should always come first. Wishing you all the best in your journey.
NTAH. You got to do the best for your mental health and, by extension, the well-being of your family. Please talk to your therapist about all this. And to get tools to stick to your decision. Sounds like no contact might be the best. Wishing you all the best in your healing hourney!
The Jocko Willink good speach had helped me previously with my people pleasing ways. Also keep in mind that your grandmother may now be good to your son. But you should always keep in mind who she is for you. Don’t let her get propper control over your boy. 

For mental health in general the best care is physical self care and a routine aswell as propper meals and sleep. 

I’d be happy to talk if you want, since I’ve been in the boat of the whole mental health and been in an inpatient psychiatric place.
Try to keep things simple and consistent for now, the more stable, monotonous, and ‘boring’ the better for your mental health. Take your time and just get in a rhythm. While getting into said rhythm, telling dad’s mom to kindly go fk herself she isn’t welcome. Untill you say otherwise. Avoid such people like the plague while you get your feet dug into your stable life. Afterwards you can start adding excitement slowly, that way you can prevent yourself from over doing it and rolling back your progress.

No one, I repeat, no one! Is worth more then your own progress. Because all of them will be better of if you achieve said progress."
Deaf peer helper around the world,8,deaf,"Yes I do understand that's how it is all over the world. There is absolutely no tendency to include all deaf people under one umbrella here. If anything, I see a lot of Deaf (I play deaf sports so I know a lot of Deaf people) vehemently against HAs and CIs because somehow they are threatened by them. A Deaf friend once told me he did not 'let' his wife go for HAs because... Anyway that's how it is here and I feel uncomfortable about people advocating on whether one should get CIs or not, unless they are ENTs.

On the livelihood part - the government does a lot actually. We have so many schemes that let's someone take loans for bare minimum interest to set up their own businesses. We don't have anything for housing though.

Mental health in general is not taken seriously here :) we all just wing it or get married and have babies. So I don't think the government does anything for it. 

Private organisations on the other hand does have a few things in place. But they are only for their own employees.

For most companies based out of India, making the workplace inclusive is all about making it inclusive as long as it doesn't cost them anything extra."
Wayward wife struggling after I cheated back. How can I help her see that rug-sweeping this isn't going to work?,86,AsOneAfterInfidelity,"I definitely think she is in a place of needing serious attention. I am not a mental health professional or a doctor so these are just layman opinions, from everything you are describing I am hearing a deep shame spiral that has likely triggered a depression. Unfortunately this is right around the time physically for postpartum depression so there is likely some interplay there that is going to require some professional help, know your suicide signs to watch for just in case. I don’t say it to instill fear, it’s just important to know what to watch for even when odds are low. These are dark days we go through and it’s critical that we recognize it early. I hope you guys find the peace and healing you both need."
Friend is dead set on being in a relationship that he is not ready for.,1,FriendshipAdvice,"Just remember you are only 1 year older than him, so not to dismiss your own experiences but you are both still so young and still have so much to learn from what life experiences are yet to come, both good and bad. 

Maybe he should ask this girl out and see what she says, just because she has mental health issues and just because he does as well doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be worthy of love. Maybe it might be something that they can share common ground on and help each other with. 

I can see you care deeply about your friend and only want what’s best for him, but you’re only 17 yourself so you may not know what’s best for him, hell he may not even know what’s best for him but that’s life. Sometimes things work out and sometimes they don’t. Sometimes we have the best experiences and sometimes it feels like the whole word is crushing us into the ground. 

As you get older you will realised that and realises that sometimes you have to step outside your comfort zone and ask the pretty girl out. 

If you feel that his mental health is that bad that any rejection could be detrimental beyond the standard “broken heart and life sucks” mentality then maybe instead of trying to deter him from doing what you think he should do, instead talk to him about the possible outcomes of what he wants to do. Ask him how he thinks he might feel if she didn’t feel the same way, ask him what he thinks would happen if they dated for a while and broke up etc. and remind him that no matter what happens it’s not the end of the world, and that you being his friend will always be there for him. 

I would also maybe encourage him to talk to a professional about his mental health too, it sounds as though he needs to given he is having panic attacks. Is he able to talk to his parents about this? Or a teacher? Or a trusted adult, as it’s also a lot for another young person like yourself to have to provide emotional support like that for.
No, he won't talk to a mental health professional. I was actually just talking to him about that. He hates his parents and doesn't trust them with his issues, and quite frankly, I wouldn't either, they aren't the most supportive. When I asked him why he wouldn't go to counseling, he told me that it's because ""he doesn't need to get better; They either drug the shit out of you, or send you to the loon box"". Having been sent to the ""loon box"" myself, I told him counselors can't prescribe medication or put you in a place unless they have reason to believe you may be a danger to yourself or others, something in which he is not. 

He also told me that he doesn't want to change because he's ""rationalized"" his problems, and that it's ""not fun so why would I want to do it"". His rationalizations seem to contradict themselves every few sentences, and fundamentally he doesn't see that his problems are genuinely a danger to his well-being, quite literally physically with his heart rate issues. 

Another thing about the girl and him, I'm not saying they aren't deserving of love, but she's definitely not the type you'd want to date. Like I said she has a very long list of mental problems, and there's usually an episode with her every week or so, it can include extreme emotional episodes or dangerous suicidal urges, and that is just not healthy for someone to be in a relationship with, I and several other of my friends have been in that situation, and it was unhealthy for both sides involved every time. 


I'm probably jumping to conclusions too quick, but im terrified to see how this might affect him given how he's taken situations like this previously rather poorly. 

It's tearing me apart inside right now because I feel like I'm being too much of a nag and that I might not be doing the right thing, or that I'm doing it in the wrong way and doing the wrong things. I've seen several friends experience, and have experienced myself what he's going through right now, and I am so damn scared of what he might do.

It really sucks because after a lot of therapy and clinicals and other stuff related to that I have been doing the best I have been in years, but as I've come out of my dark area, I'm watching my best friend go into his. 

I really don't want to hear that I'm probably not gonna be able to help him and I'm just gonna have to let things play out, but unfortunately there's nothing much more I can do than that. I just really worry and hope everything goes well which it doesn't seem like it is for him right now.

Sorry for the wall of text, I have a tendency to start blabbering when I'm worried"
Being a HCA has completely put me off nursing ,138,NursingUK,"I was a nurse in the USA. An LPN, so my license didn’t transfer. I was sexually harassed at one care home, transferred to another that was fooking horrific. The team didn’t use gloves, cross contaminated patients, didn’t care or document falls. 

It put me off nursing here. I got fired for mithering my team about PPE, trying to get soaps and hand sanitizers filled and used and documenting falls appropriately. It was one week before lock down. I called CQC and they called and told them what the complaint was and when the inspection would be. They passed with a “good.”

It is ok to protect your body and your mental health. If your heart isn’t in it, and you’re already this burned… choose another path. That’s the beauty of the UK. Education is affordable here. Don’t choose a path that will eat you alive. It’s ok.
Transfer to HCA in a mental health hospital instead, it's not amazing but it sounds a damn lot better than what you're describing. You basically just befriend and talk to people, do general observations, take them for walks and to the shops etc
Do you guys have stop work meetings in the UK? In New Zealand if a workplace is unsafe we can as nurse both put in a provisional improvement notice which is where an employer legally has to address health and safety concerns, and we can organise stop work meetings where for 90 minutes we can leave work and attend union meetings to discuss plans to address unsafe employers. It doesn’t always achieve a lot of change but it certainly makes a lot of noise and makes the news.
I wonder what options there are in the UK for things like this?
I work as an HCA in a mental health acute unit and can say with absolute certainty that it is worse. It is pure hell being at the “bottom of the pyramid” in a mental health hospital is horrific, day in and day out.
do HCAs still do personal care in a mental health hospital or are all the residents independent?
I work as a HCSW on an acute mental health ward. I’ve been here for two years and I literally hate my life and have been actively searching for alternative work. Most of our patients are rude, aggressive, abusive and threatening.    
When somebody is acutely unwell, I have all the time in the world for them and will do everything I can to ensure they are comfortable, safe and well looked after. However, this type of patient is few and far between. We seem to be swamped with anti-social drug abusers who I and all of my colleagues  receive abuse and threats from on a daily basis.    
A rehab ward seems to be what you’re describing. Our neighbour ward’s staff all seem to love their jobs with daily outings and the ability to establish therapeutic relationships with patients.

There is never going to be a stable or right time for her. I went through a similar situation with my ex — I just had to rip the bandage off. It wasn’t easy, but it improved my own mental health a lot to get out of the unhealthy relationship. 

Write a short and to-the-point email (for your record) and print it out and give her a copy directly, something like: “I am informing you that the room you have rented must be vacated by Xdate. Things cannot continue as they are — it is affecting both of our well-being. For the sake of our friendship, it is time for you to move on. Anything left behind after Xdate will be considered forfeited property. Please know I care about you and this needs to happen. -X”
yep. she hasnt paid rent in three months. has called the police on ME 3 times. and has serious mental health issues. Eviction notice posted today on her door by a process server, giving her another 30 days. after that it will take 2 more months to get a court date. its a living hell here."
" Critical, negative “friend”",84,GenXWomen,"I had a friend who behaved like this during the last few years of our friendship.

My final straw was when I made a new cheerful friend, and my negative friend expressed her opinions on how I had changed.

I told her that her negativity was not good for my mental health and I no longer wanted to associate with her. 

I had no regrets at all.

I'm getting really tired of therapists not being autism-aware,305,AutismInWomen,">Why was this therapist implying you need to just conform harder? Jesus.

Tbh I should've dumped her the second she agreed with people who said I seem like I have no feelings. Her excuse was that if they don't see it, they won't know. I don't know how this excuses other people's lack of manners or basic consideration?? You don't see me use the bathroom every morning but I'm sure you assume I do it lmao


>Do these people all just go to the same university and get taught that people with ASD just need to be convinced to stop being so weird and conform better?

I so desperately wanted to believe that maybe their schooling is just... hyperspecific to whatever topic they specialize in but I can't even say that makes sense. How are you going into a mental health field with the most outdated and offensive mindset there is? Either they're taught that we're freaks of nature or they don't mention us at all, she didn't even know the word neurodivergent until I said it in a meeting.
It’s so great isn’t it? To finally have someone who gets how your brain works and knows what to suggest that will work for you! I worked in mental health and have an MSc in psychology and I have personal beef with CBT lol. I think it’s outdated and the only the “gold standard” because it’s easy to replicate and teach. I especially don’t think it works if your anxiety or issues are coming from being a marginalised group that’s under attack. Sorry but you can’t think your way out of trans health care being removed or experiencing racism, even more so with our lack of neural pruning! 

Happy you found a therapist 💖
In order to be a professional Therapist/Counselor you need a Master's Degree in Social Work or Mental Health Counseling. You'll either be an LPC or an LCSW, it does take training and credentials to be a licensed professional. I'm in grad school to become an LPC so it's a lot of training.

Edit: if someone is calling themselves a counselor or therapist but doesn't have the credentials, then they need to be reported to the authorities."
How do I (33m) effectively convey how important having my family around is to my orphan wife (32f)?,112,relationships,"I think people are being tough on your wife... Moving to a new country is HUGE. If this is not something she agreed to do one day, I think it makes sense that she might not be ready to make the move ASAP. That being said, maybe you need to tell her this is really important to you, and make it clear you need her to consider the possibility. Someone mentioned couples counseling, and I think that's a great idea.


I get her having complicated feelings about family. As someone who has had my own struggles and has a partner with a tight knit family, I doubt she doesn't ""get"" it. I'm guessing it might bring up difficult feelings for her. It's painful to be faced with the love and support that you never received. But as your partner she should also want what's best for you... And hopefully she can work through these challenges in therapy.


Canada is a bit of a shit show. I don't know where exactly you want to move - I'm sure the situation varies province to province, but cost of living is crazy, housing is unaffordable and healthcare is a mess. She would be lucky to find a family doctor, let alone the mental health supports she needs. I would really consider this aspect of things - consider what she needs and see if you can make a plan. Can you pay privately for therapy? Are there psychiatrists you can get her referred to? Consider what supports she's receiving and whether you are able to access these supports in the community you are planning to move to.
>I moved to Wales because my now-wife was finishing her degree, but she ended up quitting due to mental health issues.

>I feel guilty because I made the decision to move here knowing this would happen

You agreed to move to Wales because that's where she was finishing her degree, that doesn't mean you guys had to settle there. 

>She didn't grow up with parents. I don't get to talk about family stuff with her because it upsets her, so stuff like old places I want to show her or family movies she won't participate in. She was forced into care with people who abused her.

She needs some therapy to deal with her trauma and not allow it to bleed into her relationship with you. It has because you feel like you can't talk about your family in the closeness that you shared without her negative reaction. She could share in that closeness now, but she hasn't dealt with her childhood trauma. 

>her mom and dad's graves are here

The graves of dead people do not get to take precedence over actual living people. You can make trips there every year to visit the graves if you want. You can also make a little shrine where she can meditate in remembrance of her parents. 

>I've gotten to the point where I'm struggling with the loneliness

>she ends up being upset about how she ""took me away from my family"" and I end up having to console her.

Tell her it was your choice to move to Wales to be with her as she finished her degree and now you would like to move closer to your family. Remind her that your family loves her, and that getting married is adjoining of families into one larger family and that she is part of your family.
I'm ngl, it's sounds like you've made a *lot* of compromises for your wife, and those compromises haven't even borne the fruit they were supposed to (your wife did not finish her education, and you said that children are not on the table anymore). I understand that going from Wales to Canada would be a big adjustment for your wife, but the reverse was a big adjustment for you too. The hardest thing is she won't even engage with the conversation.

However, going off some of your comments, your wife does not sound like she has very robust mental health at the moment (and that it's been an ongoing issue). Even if she did eventually agree to move, do you have any idea how she would adjust? Is she even capable of such a drastic change without serious detriment to her mental wellbeing? Might she become resentful the way you are now? I'm not saying that you're wrong for what you want, or that you don't have legitimate cause, but there could be unintentional consequences in your marriage if you did end up moving to Canada.

Like others have said, a couple's therapist is advisable to help you navigate this conversation. And if your wife still stonewalls and refuses to engage, then you really only have two options: accept that your life will be in Wales for the foreseeable future, or walk away from the relationship."
AITAH for not loving my mother anymore,5,AITAH,"NTA, You are absolutely 100% correct. You are definitely not safe around her. It doesn’t sound like anyone is. Going no contact and moving forward with your life without her is the best thing you can do in this situation. Anyone suggesting otherwise is clearly living in denial. Granted she can’t help it if she has mental health issues but there are things she can do to help herself like taking her medication which she chooses not to. If you can, I would tell your dad about the choking incident so that he’s aware of what happened and that she can and will go that far. 


I would strongly encourage you to see a therapist to talk with to help you to process all of what you went through with her as a teen and your feelings going forward. I’d suggest the same for your brother. If insurance is an issue, many high schools offer confidential counseling services for students. Many hospitals offer outpatient counseling and charity care where they charge you on a sliding scale fee based on your income. Typically they charge nothing for all of the outpatient services and inpatient services the hospital offers. I went this route myself a few years back to get therapy covered when I had no insurance and no money."
AITA for wanting to move out so i can live with my nephew wich would leave my dad to care for my grandmother all alone ?,10,AITAH,"NTA. It's alright you want to improve your mental health and live your own life. It's a tough situation, but it's important to prioritize your well-being.
NAH - definitely move out and take care of your mental health. Depending on where you live, inquire with Adult Protective Services about help that both your dad and grandmother is eligible for. I suspect they can get meals brought in, helper care to help bathe etc. Then maybe you commit to 1 night a week to help your father, where he can go out and get a rest, whilst you take care of your grandmother. Talk to him and think about what compromise can be made. Good luck !"
