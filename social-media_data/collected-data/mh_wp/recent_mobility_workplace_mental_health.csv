What are the challenges for wheelchair users in entering the healthcare workforce? Let's discuss!,6,disability,My son‚Äôs former mental health counselor uses a wheelchair. He‚Äôs amazing. He wrote a book and has a very small TikTok account too.
"*TW: mental health, suicide* - I need unbiased help from someone who has gone through something similar.",9,EstrangedAdultChild,"As you said you are thriving living at your boyfriends.  Being in a small town must be difficult as rumors tend to spread pretty quickly.  As another poster stated they are being incredibly ableist.  You are not mentally ill due to who you date.  As far as you making your family ill, that‚Äôs not the case either.  My parents have definitely tried that as well.  My stepmother would think that if I spent more time around my dad his depression would be cured.  Despite me having years of clinical knowledge of mental health and experience in the field, they didn‚Äôt take anything of what I said seriously.  Actually the last straw for me was that when my fiance finally confronted my parents about how they have not been involved in my life their excuse was because my dad has depression.  When pointed out that I have had my fair share of mental health issues their response was well he has it worse üôÑ Honestly I think they are both miserable and angry and just want to bring other ppl down.  It sounds like the same for your family.  Keep thriving and know that you are not the cause of someone else‚Äôs mental health issues.
Update: the grandma who wished to talk to me called to inform me that my other grandma, who also caused trauma, is coming to my workplace on Monday without asking anyone in advance. The issue is that the workplace has workers who are friends with my family. If I mention my family situation, I might be screwed. I also do not know what to do since my new workplace is not a safe place anymore (Note: I have no way of leaving this job for now)"
Reflections from Recovery -  A Very Long Post,28,antidietglp1,"First of all, I'm so happy you are doing well in your recovery!!!¬† Secondly, thanks so much for posting this! I resonate with so much of what you're saying, with regards to eating disorder recovery, the benefit of a care provider who gets it, and especially in how it's possible to use GLP-1 medication in a way that is not harmful to those of us in recovery! It's so important.¬† I hope that you'll continue to post here. I think this is a really important conversation. The distinction you're getting to between intentional weight loss for eating disorder reasons vs health reasons is a really tricky one, and needs a lot of work from mental health professionals. I'm hopeful that more awareness of the biological basis for metabolic disorders, which these medications are accelerating in our society, will help with our understanding and ability to successfully treat eating disorders, as well.¬†"
Toronto expands community-led mental health crisis service citywide,51,toronto,"so... after the crisis is over, where does the care part factor in?

Access to ongoing mental health services is, politely, not good.
You get connected to Case Management which is not only mental health services- it's support with housing, employment, physical health, peer relationships, and whatever other goals the person has."
Need input from UK mental health professionals: A person in the  middle of mental health crisis assaulted me. Do I press criminal charges?,6,AskUK,"The problem with mental health support in this country is that they will flat out refuse to help anyone until they ""hurt themselves or others"" which to me is fucking stupid. 

You should report them immediately and they will hopefully get the help they need. You're doing a good thing if you report them so don't worry about it.
You don‚Äôt ‚Äòpress charges‚Äô in the uk. You alert the authorities and they make an educated decision on how to proceed. One of those routes will be to get them the mental health support they need.

You would be doing the correct thing to report them.
Yes absolutely you should.

First, if people are in the middle of a crisis, they still need repurcutions for their actions. If only just to push them to solve their issues.

But really, it should be up to the courts to decide their punishment and if this really was down to a mental health issue then they'll be pushed to fix that. The courts may determine they're not safe to others too and may be taken away from people. Because while tragic and terrible it might be for them, the simple matter is they can't go around attacking people and if they're going to do it again they need to be put somewhere where they can be helped but also not be a danger to others.

Their mental health issues won't be of much concern to the friends and family of a fatal attack victim.

If I was going to be a danger to people, I'd want to be put in a hospital or wherever. It could even be my own loved ones that I'd attack and the last thing I want is to be roaming around a danger to people. I would want to get the help I need and going through the courts is a way of getting that.
Yes because its the right thing to do, and may mean that the person can access forensic mental health services.
Not a legal mental health professional but I've dealt with the police in regards to mental health issues and they were never great. 

I'm not a full on religious hippy turn the other cheek kind of guy, I do believe vengeance isn't always a bad thing, some people will never learn and often a kick in the teeth is the only thing they understand and the best form of justice anyone's ever going to get when some waste of spaces are involved....

That being said, I don't view our legal system as a punishment system, I try to view it as a necessary evil in some cases, and a possible path to rehabilitation in best cases. 


All you have to ask yourself is, will pressing charges against this person improve their situation in the long term, or keep others safe?

If the answer to both those questions is no, you're left only with vengeance, and does that person deserve to at least suffer for what they did.

If criminal charges aren't going to help them sort their issues out, they aren't a threat to others so the charges won't keep others safe, and you at the very least won't feel good about getting them punished, what's even left to ask.

-------
That‚Äôs crisis support mainly. But yeah there is a culture of ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt help until you‚Äôve proved you‚Äôre a danger to yourself or others‚Äù. 

General mental health support, i.e. therapy, for those not in crisis is free on the NHS and anyone can refer.
Not necessarily the right call. I know a lady who suffers with mental health issues and was mid flashback when a police officer tried to intervene. She panicked and attacked him and now has assaulting an officer on her criminal record. She's trying to get out of a domestic abuse situation which is aggravating her mental health but nowhere will take her because of her record.

This person needs medical help, not punishment."

‚ÄúParanoid leftist gish-gallop slop‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs a solid five words with zero substance. It‚Äôs funny how the moment we start talking solutions, people like you turn off your brain and start spewing the same tired dismissals. Let‚Äôs break this down for the folks playing along at home.

# 1. ‚ÄúSay something unique for once.‚Äù

You mean unique like the innovative idea that human beings deserve to live with dignity? Or unique like suggesting worker cooperatives, universal healthcare, and a Green New Deal as practical steps to overhaul a broken system? Maybe it‚Äôs not ‚Äúunique‚Äù because these ideas are supported by mountains of evidence and the lived experiences of people tired of being ground down by a system that prioritizes profit over people. Just because you‚Äôve heard these solutions before doesn‚Äôt make them any less valid‚Äîor necessary.

# 2. ‚ÄúParanoid leftist‚Äù

Calling concerns about wealth inequality, climate change, and the exploitation of labor ‚Äúparanoia‚Äù is like calling a fire alarm annoying while the building burns down around you. It‚Äôs not paranoia when the evidence is staring you in the face. We‚Äôre living in a world where a handful of billionaires hoard more wealth than half the global population, the planet‚Äôs on a fast track to ecological collapse, and millions struggle to access basic necessities. That‚Äôs not paranoia; it‚Äôs reality.

# 3. ‚ÄúGish-gallop slop‚Äù

Translation: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep up with the arguments, so I‚Äôll dismiss them all at once.‚Äù The term ‚Äúgish-gallop‚Äù refers to overwhelming an opponent with numerous points, true or not, to drown them in details. Here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîeach point I made was substantive and backed by real-world examples. Worker cooperatives exist and thrive. Universal healthcare is a reality in multiple countries. UBI has been tested successfully in various places. If your response to detailed solutions is to call them ‚Äúslop,‚Äù maybe the issue isn‚Äôt the argument but your inability to engage with it.

# 4. What‚Äôs Actually Paranoid?

Believing that challenging capitalism means descending into chaos and dystopia‚Äîthat‚Äôs paranoid. Believing that any critique of the current system is an attack on ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs paranoid. Clinging to a system that clearly doesn‚Äôt work for most people while pretending it‚Äôs the best we can do? That‚Äôs delusional.

# 5. If This is ‚ÄúSlop,‚Äù What‚Äôs Your Gourmet?

I laid out concrete, actionable solutions: democratizing workplaces, universal healthcare, UBI, breaking up monopolies, and a Green New Deal. If you‚Äôve got a better plan for fixing a system that‚Äôs clearly broken, let‚Äôs hear it. But something tells me you‚Äôre more interested in throwing out dismissive buzzwords than engaging in an actual discussion.

So, yeah, I‚Äôll keep saying what I‚Äôm saying, because it‚Äôs what needs to be said. If that bores you, maybe take a hard look at why you find the prospect of a fairer, more just world so uninteresting.
**Reply:**

Alright, let‚Äôs slice through your rhetoric and get to the meat of the argument.

1. **""The solutions I laid out are real, actionable, and backed by data.""**
   * **Worker Cooperatives:** Let's start with Mondragon in Spain. Far from being some utopian fantasy, it's a collection of cooperatives that employs around 80,000 people and generates billions in revenue annually. Mondragon competes globally, manufacturing everything from industrial machines to consumer goods. [Grassroots Economic Organizing](https://geo.coop/gleanings/how-mondragon-became-worlds-largest-co-op) provides comprehensive data on its success, including higher worker satisfaction and fair profit distribution. This model isn‚Äôt a theory; it‚Äôs a thriving reality.
   * **Universal Basic Income (UBI):** Various UBI pilots, such as those in Finland and Stockton, California, have demonstrated that providing a guaranteed income improves financial security, mental health, and even local economies. The [Roosevelt Institute](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/the-macroeconomic-effects-of-a-ubi) reported that a UBI could add $2.5 trillion to the U.S. economy over eight years. This isn‚Äôt just wishful thinking; it‚Äôs backed by real-world data.
2. **""Most of your claims are political rhetoric.""**
   * If you think calling out systemic issues is just ‚Äúpolitical rhetoric,‚Äù you‚Äôre missing the point. This isn‚Äôt about ideology‚Äîit‚Äôs about facts. Wealth inequality is skyrocketing, healthcare costs are ruining lives, and the environment is collapsing. These aren‚Äôt abstract concepts, they‚Äôre measurable crises. Ignoring them doesn‚Äôt make them disappear.
3. **""You are hiding the ball.""**
   * Hiding the ball? I‚Äôm laying it all out right here. Your argument that ""workers owning the means of production"" leads to totalitarianism is a weak strawman. Democratic ownership‚Äîsuch as worker cooperatives‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt resemble centralized authoritarianism. Worker co-ops like Mondragon are transparent, democratic, and self-managed. There‚Äôs no dictator here, just collective decision-making. If you‚Äôre still equating that to Soviet-style control, it‚Äôs time to update your talking points.
4. **""Attempts at proletariat control have led to totalitarianism.""**
   * You‚Äôre stuck conflating centralized, top-down authoritarian states with decentralized, worker-controlled cooperatives. Worker co-ops are inherently democratic: one worker, one vote. Compare that to capitalist systems where decisions are made by a few shareholders or CEOs, and tell me again which system resembles feudalism.
5. **""You're just a complainer.""**
   * Ah, the old ‚Äúcomplainer‚Äù argument. Guess what? Critique isn‚Äôt the same as inaction. My ‚Äúwhining‚Äù on Reddit? It‚Äôs called spreading awareness, sharing solutions, and engaging in discourse that leads to action. You might not like the format, but digital platforms are where real activism lives today. If you think the only valid form of activism involves picket lines, you're decades behind.
6. **""I got the data to prove it and you don't.""**
   * Then bring it. So far, all I‚Äôve seen is deflection and empty claims. Drop the sources, show the studies. Until then, I‚Äôll continue presenting real-world examples like Mondragon and UBI pilots that have been studied and proven effective.

**tl;dr**: I‚Äôm here presenting solutions backed by evidence. If you want to keep shouting slogans, be my guest. But don‚Äôt expect me to take your ‚Äúcertified DUMB ASS!‚Äù badge seriously until you bring something more to the table than empty buzzwords and ad hominems.

The floor is yours.
> Various UBI pilots, such as those in Finland and Stockton, California, have demonstrated that providing a guaranteed income improves financial security, mental health, and even local economies. The Roosevelt Institute reported that a UBI could add $2.5 trillion to the U.S. economy over eight years. This isn‚Äôt just wishful thinking; it‚Äôs backed by real-world data. 

These are **just** pilots, which are affordable for a small group of people for a limited time. It would be utterly unaffordable to implement UBI for everyone, indefinitely. I think the experience of handing out free money during the Covid pandemic ought to made this obvious. We are going to take years to pay off the debt which was incurred for these programs.

If you want to advocate for UBI, show us where the money will come from - and please don't say something vague like: ""from the billionaires and large corporations"" - provide actual numbers. 

Oh, and your link to the Roosevelt Institute 'report' doesn't go anywhere. Nice try.

>Worker co-ops like Mondragon are transparent, democratic, and self-managed. 

Mondragon is worker owned, but not worker managed.

>Compare that to capitalist systems where decisions are made by a few shareholders or CEOs, and tell me again which system resembles feudalism. 

Actually, most large corporations are widely held, with tens of thousands of shareholders electing directors, who in turn hire CEO and other executives to run companies. It is **NOTHING AT ALL LIKE FEUDALISM.**

>Until then, I‚Äôll continue presenting real-world examples like Mondragon 

Mondragon is the **ONLY** real-world example that you keep presenting, over and over again. I find it notable that you cannot come up with other examples."
The Great Capitalist Con: Why Everything You‚Äôve Been Told About ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù Is a Lie,9,CapitalismVSocialism,"Ah, the classic ‚ÄúThis is just a rant‚Äù dismissal. Nice attempt to sidestep the entire critique by calling it too emotional, too long, and too‚Ä¶ well, whatever you need to justify not engaging with the actual points. Let‚Äôs break down your response.

# ""No Argument Given""

The entire post is a string of arguments. If you missed them, it‚Äôs because you chose not to see them. Pointing out systemic exploitation, environmental destruction, and the illusion of choice is not just ‚Äútalking‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs laying bare the mechanics of a broken system. If that‚Äôs not an argument, then maybe the problem isn‚Äôt my post; it‚Äôs your ability to recognize one.

# ""No Evidence Presented""

Do we really need to drag out every statistic and citation to prove the obvious? Millions are struggling to afford basic healthcare, the planet is burning, and wealth inequality is soaring. These aren‚Äôt fringe opinions; they‚Äôre widely documented realities. If you need a bibliography for every sentence, you‚Äôre not looking for a debate‚Äîyou‚Äôre looking for a way to ignore the points being made.

# ""No End Goals or Pathways""

This post wasn‚Äôt a policy brief; it was a wake-up call. But since you asked, the pathways are simple: dismantle corporate monopolies, democratize the workplace, implement universal healthcare, and prioritize sustainability over profit. It‚Äôs not that complicated, but it does require acknowledging that the status quo isn‚Äôt working.

# ""Too Long to Care""

Translation: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt actually read it, but I‚Äôll pretend it‚Äôs just too long to bother with.‚Äù The length is only an issue if you‚Äôre unwilling to confront uncomfortable truths. If you‚Äôve got time to type out a critique of the length, you‚Äôve got time to engage with the content.

# ""Agree to Disagree""

Sure, we can ‚Äúagree to disagree‚Äù if by that you mean agreeing to ignore the problems and pretend everything‚Äôs fine. But that‚Äôs not a debate‚Äîthat‚Äôs sticking your head in the sand. If you really think these issues are just subjective opinions, then you‚Äôre missing the whole point. This isn‚Äôt about agreement; it‚Äôs about facing reality.

So, no, it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust a rant.‚Äù It‚Äôs a call to action. If that‚Äôs too much for you, maybe the problem isn‚Äôt the post‚Äîit‚Äôs that the truth makes you uncomfortable.
Let's break down your concerns one by one because there's a lot to unpack.

**'Work or Die':** Socialism isn't about lounging while luxuries magically appear. It's about ensuring that everyone's basic needs are met so that we aren't forced into soul-crushing jobs just to survive. When people aren't living in fear of destitution, they're free to pursue meaningful work that benefits society. Economic democracy means we all have a say in how our labor is valued and utilized.

**'Upward Mobility':** In a socialist society, there isn't a monolithic 'GovCorp' pulling the strings. Instead, workplaces are collectively owned and managed by those who work there. This decentralization of power means progression is based on contribution and collaboration, not on pleasing distant corporate overlords or political elites. True freedom is when everyone has an equal voice, not when a few hold all the cards.

**'Economic Cannibalism':** Currently, capitalism has led to monopolies that dominate markets and suppress competition. Under socialism, the goal is to eliminate these monopolies by distributing ownership among the workers and the community. This prevents any single entity from wielding oppressive power. Economic decisions are made democratically, ensuring they serve the public good rather than private interests.

**'Planet on Fire':** It's not paranoia to acknowledge scientific consensus. Climate change is a real and pressing threat exacerbated by unchecked capitalist consumption and exploitation of resources. While nature is resilient, it's not infinite. Socialism promotes sustainable practices by valuing the environment over profit margins, recognizing that our well-being is intrinsically linked to the health of our planet.

**'Healthcare':** You pointed out that both government and private entities can exploit healthcare for profit, and that's a valid concern. However, socialism advocates for healthcare as a fundamental human right, free from profit motives. When the community controls healthcare, with transparency and democratic oversight, it serves the people rather than exploiting them.

Regarding the concentration of power, socialism seeks to distribute power more evenly, preventing the 0.01%‚Äîwho currently hold disproportionate influence‚Äîfrom controlling our lives. By involving everyone in economic decision-making, we dismantle the structures that allow such extreme inequalities.

Communism isn't about handing over control to a tyrannical government; it's about creating a classless society where resources and power are shared equitably. It's about liberation from systems that devalue our humanity. People naturally aspire to create, build, and contribute when they're part of a community that values them.

We need to move past the fear-mongering stereotypes of socialism and communism. They're not dirty words but visions for a future where everyone has the freedom to live fulfilling lives without the chains of exploitation. Let's focus on building a society that nurtures our innate desires to connect, create, and thrive together."
Almost at breaking point.,7,CaregiverSupport,"Most older people resist going to any facility, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do for themselves or for their loved ones. Why does he think it's ok for you and your sibling to be cleaning up after his messes? He's not entitled to that from his children, and this must be causing a massive strain and stress for both of you. You have numerous mental health issues, and he is not thinking about you. Because of that you will have to lay down some boundaries and protect yourself (same goes for your sister). That may be hard, but it's not your fault because he should be thinking about the well-being of his children, not forcing them to make extreme sacrifices. There's also the issue of a fall when no one is home, and that could be catastrophic. Anyhow, people here end up suicidal, and often older people are just not considering their impact on others. That's why I'm encouraging you to do what you need for your own sanity, and secondarily what might keep him safe and comfortable."
Has this injury impacted your mental health?,17,AchillesRupture,"At the start was ok, when I was on crutches I found walking around was a decent workout, the crap time for me was about week 12 - 20. I‚Äôm almost at 5 months and started jogging running a bit -makes a huge difference . I was really frustrated before and sport is so important to my mental health
Almost identical: first game in ~10y, didn‚Äôt make it to half time üò£. July 12th, just this week starting to walk without a boot. In contrast to some others, I‚Äôm a very active runner (marathons, etc) and it still happened to me so if you‚Äôre feeling guilty about ‚Äútrying to do too much‚Äù it‚Äôs maybe true but also maybe not. No reason to beat yourself up. 
Mental health part is also no joke and been a big struggle for me too. Trying to remember the only way forward is through and it WILL get better"
