I don't understand what the wife wants. She may be not delusional but she sure is crazy and inconsistent. Does she only want a punching ball? What did she think would happen? I hope OOP can divorce her stupid ass quickly, but she seems determined to drag this on...
The realization is hitting Grace that she let her family get to her. And she’s too prideful to backdown.
This is the problem with religious cults. They get their hooks into you as children and then, when you’re a stressed adult, you pull them out for comfort like others do with a homemade chicken noodle soup recipe. It’s dangerous and insidious. 

I feel bad for the husband and the daughter, plus the dirty wedge she permanently made them feel.

I'm getting really tired of therapists not being autism-aware,302,AutismInWomen,"She sounds like bs for nt people too
1. If someone finds ""big words"" pretentious, that's a them problem, not an issue for you to deal with.  
2. This is just silly. There's obviously a difference between casual social relationships and a professional therapist-patient session. This is especially dumb since she's done it herself...  
3. Some people do find it weird, some people don't. Decent people will not make a fuss about how a compliment is phrased as long as it's genuine, though. Again, why is it on YOU to baby and coddle other people? They can use their words. Why was this therapist implying you need to just conform harder? Jesus.

Finding a good therapist is such a chore. I had a PTSD therapist who was just as annoying and clueless, and I don't get why it's seemingly so prevalent. Do these people all just go to the same university and get taught that people with ASD just need to be convinced to stop being so weird and conform better? I'm so glad you ""dumped"" her because this shit is just insufferable.
Frustrating. You're not alone. 


After 6 months of trauma therapy, I decided to disclose to my therapist I suspected I have autism. (And that it likely played a large role in my cpstd and how I process trauma)


She told me it sounded like I was just looking for another label of something 'wrong' with me 🙃
You gotta get yourself a therapist that is also autistic themselves. 

I had 10 years of traditional therapy as an adult and a few as a child and I guess I’m alive but they definitely made a lot of things worse. 

I found a therapist who specialises in somatic therapy for autistic people and has a couple of PhDs in ND research. She’s also AuDHD like me and I’ve made more progress in 18 months with her than I have with all previous therapists. 

Try this [directory](https://ndtherapists.com) and see if there’s any near you? Mine is double the price of a regular therapist but honestly it’s worth it to not have someone to tell me to “just stop thinking about it”.
This is why I plan on pursuing master and doctorate in psychology."
AIO for telling my boyfriend to fuck off ,305,AmIOverreacting,"Girl this is not going to get better... dont ask me how I know.  Plan your escape.  Give him the ultimate, a job , counseling and 50/ 50 house work or you're out.  You are just raising a man child at this point
Why are you seven months pregnant and he’s not working and you’re working two jobs. Might as well just kick his ass to the curb because you don’t need him.
Maybe consider kicking the worthless leach out? Sounds like you'll probably end up basically a single mother anyway. He can't be arsed to help you while pregnant. Not overreacting.
NOR

My sister went through this. Her bf got expelled from college for fighting and she became depressed and dropped out. She worked and enrolled in night classes while he sat in their apartment playing video games, expecting her to cook dinner after a three flight walk up with groceries.

I ordered her prenatal vitamins so she had what she needed while getting almost no rest and even less help from him. He enlisted to run away but ended up getting somebody else pregnant while in basic training.

She moved back into our parents' house and had her baby and they lived there. Our parents paid for her divorce so she had full custody of her son and didn't have to deal with the deadbeat. However, I'm told that he tried to apologize and get her to take him back when he was dishonorably discharged (for fighting again!). She laughed in his face.

So, you did a great job from this angle. No woman wants a grown-toddler and you took care of what needed to be done.

And, I'm sure we're going to get an update sooner rather than later that ditched the unnecessary weight.

Kudos!
You love him? Will love pay you and your babies bills? No. And he doesn’t love YOU. Sorry. If he did you’d be married and he’d be working to help you. Hitting copy on this beta is a mistake. You will see it eventually after you’re so burnt out that you take it out on your kid"
Being a HCA has completely put me off nursing ,136,NursingUK,"I'm a TNA, and on my base ward I'm in the HCA number for my long shifts. On my short shifts I shadow nurses.

All that to say - I've had 3 shifts in the 4 months since I've started where it's just been me and one HCA, so we've had to split the workload in half and look after 12 patients each.

I keep saying to myself and other people that I'm not sure how many more of those I have in me. It's so unsafe. 

I completely get where you're coming from!

And I have raised it with my Educator and university. Both aren't able to do anything about staffing levels obviously, but I made them aware so that I'm not suffering in silence at least.
Would you consider trying out other fields? I was a hca on an adult amu which totally put me off nursing, but I switched to work on a paeds ward and now I'm about to qualify as an rcn. It's totally OK to write off nursing - but if the idea still niggles at you sometimes it might be worth trying out a different field. 
Firstly- I applaud you for taking on such responsibilities and dedication to our patients. You'd be a fantastic healthcare professional in any field.

Secondly- have you thought about taking it to Freedom to Speak? Freedom to Speak should be able to signpost you to where to raise your concerns about staffing on shift and the risk you clearly understand is present everyday with your workload.

Really hope you're protecting your wellbeing
Remember, that nurses don't have to work on wards or a&e. Lots of areas that aren't that pressured.
I was a nurse in the USA. An LPN, so my license didn’t transfer. I was sexually harassed at one care home, transferred to another that was fooking horrific. The team didn’t use gloves, cross contaminated patients, didn’t care or document falls. 

It put me off nursing here. I got fired for mithering my team about PPE, trying to get soaps and hand sanitizers filled and used and documenting falls appropriately. It was one week before lock down. I called CQC and they called and told them what the complaint was and when the inspection would be. They passed with a “good.”

It is ok to protect your body and your mental health. If your heart isn’t in it, and you’re already this burned… choose another path. That’s the beauty of the UK. Education is affordable here. Don’t choose a path that will eat you alive. It’s ok."

As someone who has worked in this industry all over the world, his kind of confrontational, macho, head-on approach is definitely not the way it would be handled in other markets, I'll say that.

How do I (33m) effectively convey how important having my family around is to my orphan wife (32f)?,114,relationships,"I think it's very reasonable to want to be near your family. There is nothing wrong with that urge. But I think you need to go to your wife with a direct ask. Because you're right, she had a different childhood than you and probably isn't the right person to get emotional support on for this. She likely doesn't know what you're looking for.


But maybe, if you say ""honey, I want to move to x-city and be closer to my family. My parents are getting older and I miss them. Can we start planning to do that with a target of x-date?"" If she says no, she's never moving, well then you have tough decisions to make. If she says yes, isn't that best case? And if it's something in between you've opened the door of communication. 


So I think you need to decide what you want the solution to be, and then ask if she is willing to work with you to get there. 
Did you say “I want to move to XYZ and be closer to my family”

If she says no you decide if you can live with that or not


And kids of your own??   You are both in agreement??   If not that is a dealbreaker
I think people are being tough on your wife... Moving to a new country is HUGE. If this is not something she agreed to do one day, I think it makes sense that she might not be ready to make the move ASAP. That being said, maybe you need to tell her this is really important to you, and make it clear you need her to consider the possibility. Someone mentioned couples counseling, and I think that's a great idea.


I get her having complicated feelings about family. As someone who has had my own struggles and has a partner with a tight knit family, I doubt she doesn't ""get"" it. I'm guessing it might bring up difficult feelings for her. It's painful to be faced with the love and support that you never received. But as your partner she should also want what's best for you... And hopefully she can work through these challenges in therapy.


Canada is a bit of a shit show. I don't know where exactly you want to move - I'm sure the situation varies province to province, but cost of living is crazy, housing is unaffordable and healthcare is a mess. She would be lucky to find a family doctor, let alone the mental health supports she needs. I would really consider this aspect of things - consider what she needs and see if you can make a plan. Can you pay privately for therapy? Are there psychiatrists you can get her referred to? Consider what supports she's receiving and whether you are able to access these supports in the community you are planning to move to.
This might be something to go to couples counseling about, since previous attempts to communicate about it seem to be her not taking it as seriously as you do. I agree with others, I don’t like that sometimes it ends with her getting comfort from you but I think a third party could help change the dynamic and help you get more to the root of the issue.  

 I relate to this a lot. I also moved away from my family—not as far as I used to live but at one point my goal was just to get far away because that’s what I needed for my independence. I don’t regret that at all but I also dated someone with few family connections, and realised I was thinking my idea of “I don’t need to be close to my family” was me comparing myself to people I grew up with who now live next door to their parents. I have zero desire to live in my hometown, but I DO value those relationships a lot and I am glad I live closer now that my parents are also getting older. Anyway, back to my ex. This wasn’t a factor in our breakup, but sometimes it felt like they just didn’t comprehend why I would want to see my parents and childhood friends so often, why my parents would help me out with stuff (and vice versa), or even why I was talking to my parents about stuff in my daily life (they would think it’s none of my parents’ business bc THEIR parents didn’t care). It was like, I don’t need you to be BFFs with everyone else in my life, but we couldn’t even cross over the bridge of them understanding why I even had those relationships in the first place. And I wanted them to care a little more, like maybe remembering my family members’ names after years of dating. Anyway, it was just an ongoing low level frustration that I didn’t really register I was dealing with until after our breakup. Again, this isn’t why we broke up and things were improving in some aspects so I don’t think it’s necessarily something I would’ve broken up about either, more like almost a cultural difference that I think we could’ve put more effort into addressing… and honestly something I’ll be looking to avoid in my next relationship. 
>Every time I see them, they're a little older. I know it sounds stupid but it hurts to see.

This is not stupid.

> Or the third being where she ends up being upset about how she ""took me away from my family"" and I end up having to console her. 

Do not console her. Do not let her deflect from your issues by making them about her.

>I don't get to talk about family stuff with her because it upsets her, so stuff like old places I want to show her or family movies she won't participate in. 

This also is completely not OK.

>I feel guilty because I made the decision to move here knowing this would happen, so I'm pretty much solely to blame for how I feel.

I mean I sort of get it but, she has no family. Why can't you both consider moving back home to where you live, particularly since your family loves her? She gets the family she never had, you get your family back. Why is this not an option?"
" Critical, negative “friend”",81,GenXWomen,"“That’s a shitty thing to say, Barb.” Repeat as necessary. She’ll ghost you and save you the trouble.
I've come to the realization that sometimes friendships run their course, and that's ok. I had a friend that I knew since grade school. We used to do lots of things together. I didn't have kids, and she eventually had 3. When she had her first, we would still get together occasionally. But by the time she had all 3, our relationship became one where I only ever heard from her when it was a gift-giving occasion for one of her kids, or they had a school fundraiser. It was clear, though, that she still made time for her other friends who also had kids, so I just let that one go. I'm not an ATM.
I would ghost her. Just quietly fade away. Or suddenly become too busy for anything to do with her. I have no room for constant negativity.
Unacceptable. I think leaving her a short message saying pretty much what you’ve said here is the way to go.

I know we’re in an era when ghosting is seen as normal but it’s not. She’s going to think you are just busy and if she’s in the wrong she needs to hear it.

I had a friend who was been extremely paternalistic. I told him the advice he wasn’t giving wasn’t helping me and I didn’t appreciate him talking like my dad and I asked for more respect. He never apologized and stopped talking. Some people are emotionally immature brats.
I recently had to cut someone out of my social life for this very reason. She could take ZERO hints about my decreasing availability, and I was becoming miserable. I basically just said ""I'm not up for this any more,"" and stopped hanging out with her. She hates it, and it's arduous for me, but I am *so relieved.*

It's made more complicated by the fact that my kid is close friends with her kid, so we still are in each other's orbits, but at least I'm not spending an hour or two listening to her bitching, just waiting for her to leave, any time she drops then off!"
We're forgetting a vital detail: Andrew was just 14.,69,AndrewGosden,"I think people underestimate his intelligence whilst overestimating his level of social awareness and independence. I was friends with someone like him through secondary school before I moved for A-Levels and at 14 he was sitting the local maths and spelling bee olympiads and held gold prizes in regional maths competitions. I always felt that whilst he was academically smart he was remarkably naive and poorly socialised owing to his preference to spend most of his time at home or in school clubs. 

With this in mind even though grooming is a likely theory, it's equally as likely that he was simply a naive young boy who met an unlucky and unfortunate end. 

***as always: if you have a tip, please submit it--no matter how small***
Very valid points, I'm now leaning towards it being an impulsive decision on the day to just see where the day took him
100% I was a moron at 14. Tho being a girl
I maybe was slightly more wary of certain situations.
I don't think you can so easily generalise about 14 year olds. In many ways I was more cautious as a kid than I am now, as I've had life experience to know it'll probably be okay and ah well if it isn't. I was a real worrier when I was 14.

My point is that the stereotype about kids being impulsive and lacking caution isn't always true. Andrew going to London was impulsive, I'll grant that, but it doesn't mean he had no caution at all.

Also, the idea we've missed something in not considering his age is quite strange to me as that's been a large part of the concern from day one.
Thinking back to when I was 14 years old.. I fell out with my mum one morning, showed up at school with £50 and a change of clothes (won’t get you far lol). I had no idea how to buy a train ticket asked the teacher how because I was going to go stay with my sister until things cooled down. Andrew knew how to buy a ticket so I believe yes he could have done something impulsive."

Facebook Comment,52,WOACB,"She’s a medical “professional” but doesn’t know how to spell HIPAA? Also, HIPAA only applies to that persons medical team.

What if the internet decided to start blaming KJ for all of her son's issues? And that's all we talk about. Its all her fault he is medically fragile. Its all her fault that he can't do all the things he wants to..she would flip her shit.

HIPAA. I don’t believe this commenter
I’m not even American and I know HIPAA is not spelled HIPPA and this person claims to be a medical professional? Also how did Gypsy’s medical records become public? How did KJ get hold of them. If Gypsy Rose stopped putting her whole life out there, the gossip content creators wouldn’t be talking about her, they would move on. Gypsy Rose wants to be talked about, she wants the attention.

A message to people with aphantasia.,49,shiftingrealities,"Have you ever thought about how shifting mechanically works? Visualization is one of the tools of what can help you feel your desired reality, is it possible that total immersion and dissolving yourself into your desired reality is a necessity in order to shift? That is, a complete refocusing from this reality into another? So your perception is completely shifted to a different picture
I don't have aphantasia, but bless you, this post would be perfect if I did 💖
I saw someone say “Think Blind” and it helped me A LOT mentally
I do not believe there's a mechanism for shifting, and as such, don't believe there's any such thing of how it ""mechanically works""


I can tell you from experience that you don't have to be totally dissolved in it to shift. In fact, shifting without visualization is possible and even common among successful shifters. Like I said in the post (I think?) I was shifting successfully even before treating the aphantasia


I'll try to liken the process to something else: affirmation techniques in the present reality. If you want to improve your life somewhat, e.g. improve your confidence, you don't have to literally flawlessly visualize yourself as that person. For some people, you really can just affirm

Idk how to talk to my husband anymore,23,SchizoFamilies,"Here with you. Today I broke down sobbing and he softened up. He went from distrusting and lashing out angrily to a having glimmer of empathy for me in his eyes. I asked him for help.  I know things will probably go back to chaos tomorrow but it felt like a little breakthrough
I am so sorry this is happening. I wish I had the solution for you. This sounds very similar to what happened to my younger brother 7 years back. It’s fucking hard.
Hey I relate. It’s really challenging! And everyone has their limits—if you have ever endured more than you can handle, it’s okay to walk away. Me? I’ll never give up. My man is brilliant when he’s well—best person I know. But there are days where it feels unbearable. Stay strong. I advocate for the injection—a lot of people with sza neglect their medication, but my bf takes a shot and it’s a 3 month supply. It is sensational. It’s worthwhile noting though that just recently we have agreed he needs to change it to every 2 months, because around the 2 month mark things have been getting hairy (I’m “lucky”—I just deal with outrageous infidelity delusions currently—the fact your partner works in tech and it suspicious of tech sounds truly dreadful and you have my sympathy). The drug use needs to stop. People in the early adjustment stages can think drugs help & genuinely they may be what they feel is a great way to escape their mind. But it makes symptoms worse in the long run :(. My bf with sza has “sleepers”. They’re a sedative & antipsychotic. He yells out & fights in his sleep—the sleepers knock him out & he is so dead he sometimes struggles to wake up. See a therapist of your own as well. Good luck xx
In a sadly similar situation. The person I care for has essentially the same delusions, seems compliant-ish with their treatment, but refuses any collaboration with regard to their medical care and is resolutely and intensely against any inpatient care. So when things start to get bad it feels there’s very little I can do. 

I have no answers, but you are not alone.
It sounds like you're doing all of the right things. Each situation is different and there is no magic answer. 


In my relationship, setting boundaries helps to keep me from getting pulled under. Differentiate between the things that you are able to make better and the things that you are not. 


Let go of the feelings that that are exhausting you. Now that you know you can't force him to take medication or therapy, then it sounds like it's time to relieve yourself of responsibility for those things. Think of some of his symptoms in terms of a person who is paralyzed and in a wheelchair. No amount of intervention on your part is going to get him to stand up and walk. Instead, you find ways to help him where he is. 


If you don't create boundaries like this, then instead of one victim of his illness, there will be two and he will have lost his partner and best supporter. Find boundaries that help preserve your self-esteem, your energy, and your own mental health. That will keep you most able to help him when things shift and he has moments of willingness to seek treatment, and moments of awareness of how he can modify his behavior so that the symptoms of his illness don't hurt the people around him as much."

Screw those guys 🤬

As for diy, check out the side bar on /r/transdiy and read posts describing what other people do. They have a lot of resources, and I think this subs mods prefer DIY details to be discussed there.
From finland and doing diy. 

1. Most suppliers usually take bitcoin, I use coinbase as my wallet. It was very intimidating for me too at first, but it is not too hard. When you are about to buy something they give you an adress that you post into the wallet and send the money that they asked for. The wallets usually take a fee so remember to add at least 5€ extra. 

2. I have gotten both E vials and progesterone through the customs but pills are harder to get through. I dont know what amount would be safe to take through but I wouldnt chance any more than 2 vials at a time and 3 months worth of pills at a time. Pills do have an experation date that you can check on the packages, vials however will last years if stored right and havent been in contact with the air. The normal vials in diy has enough in them for 9-12 months of use depending on how much u use each time. 

3. I use 29G insulin needles but you can use any Gauge from 23-30G. The issues with smaller needles is that it takes longer to get the E into the syringe, the issue with bigger needles is that its bigger and if you dislike needles the bigger ones are worse, the bigger ones can also core the vials however that mostly happens with 18-20G. I can let you know where I got my needles in a dm if you want, you might get some from aptekki but idk. 

4. I can dm you but also check out r/transdiy, there they can talk about sellers. 


I'm sorry transpoli has been so awful to you too. I got turned away from them twice, once for depression because of the reasons you also mentioned, and last time because I'm in the process of getting my autism diagnosis. They didnt say it out right but they basically said that because I ""might"" have autism I cant be reliable enough to know I'm trans. Its fucked up."

 Sorry to hear that. Was she ever there for you at any point? It sounds like she can’t or doesn’t want to deal with any of your problems unfortunately. 

Have you talked to much about your problems to her? I have had a former friend tell me that she was tired of being my ‘therapist’. 

Unfortunately a lot of people except other people to listen to & support them, but some people won’t return the favor. 

They’re selfish fair weather friends. Sometimes I wonder if people use excuses like being ‘to negative’ as an excuse to deal with anything that makes them feel uncomfortable. 

Maybe she was merely a fair weather friend? Those types of ‘friends’ will often drop people the moment that things become inconvenient for them. 

That FB comment is passive aggressive & rude. She should’ve just told you that she doesn’t want to hear it instead.
I’m sorry babes ❤️ xx
How incredibly hurtful. I think you made the right decision to cut her out of your life.
Hi! It sounds like this was a one-sided friendship... sorry for your loss, but many people are way more selfish than you think.

Often in my friendships, I am the one who cares for them, always listens and goes on walks with my friends, if they want company. Just being there for them. But they very rarely are there for me. I ended those relationships, now do not have friends and instead have freedom and piece."
Support Groups - Online or In Person,16,physicianassistant,"Healthcare is a business. Business is mostly customer service and sales. Treat it that way and let patients choose their own adventure. Otherwise, look for ways to get out. 

Medicine doesn't seem to get better in any metric other than extracting revenue from patients, insurers and tax payers. Outcomes are not improving. Health isn't improving. Lifespan isn't improving. 

Root cause of disease and solutions simply are not profitable and Americans don't want to hear their health issues are caused by their lifestyle. When you realize this you will stop losing sleep about it. 

Good luck.
I think I’ve gotten so used to people telling me what they want… now I’m caught off guard whenever anyone actually asks for my clinical opinion and what I’d recommend.

Posts like this make me so glad I have worked with underserved patients for the bulk of my career, and now am technically semi-rural. Could not imagine dealing with some bougie patient population day in and day out. Don't get me wrong, we get our fair share too, but my patients tend to fall much further in the low healthcare literacy, non-compliant end than what you are describing.

Hey buddy, a fellow man here. Just like you. I am still working as a contractor for a US company. I've been arround 10 years with them. Are you really a contractor at that point? Anyway, a few days ago we got the news, that they plan to lay off all the contractors. Everyone will be replaced with indian workers. They asked us to participate in the hiring process and hire people as good as we are. I don't think that is possible. Skill wise - maybe, knowledge wise - absolutely not. You gather so much critical knowledge about processes and business domain... I really have a bad taste in my mouth when I try to think about hiring someone to replace me and other great people. Fucking yuck.

Hey man, thanks for sharing. I'm really sorry to hear that. I get what you're saying—it's dehumanizing to train someone who's going to replace you, not because you're moving up the ladder, but because you're soon going to be jobless. I can't even imagine how they can ask people to do that. And you're right—when you've worked for someone for so long, of course, you have that specific knowledge that someone new just can't have. Have you started looking for a new job yet, or are you somehow 'bound' to stay with them for a while?"
Doctors saying using a mobility device for pain isn’t good,14,FND,"fnd being a mental illness / psychological condition is an unfortunate misconception many doctors have

fnd can be affected by your mental health, of course, but so can things like parkinson’s and heart disease

fnd is a real neurological condition (and even if it was entirely psychological), your pain is real and if using a mobility aid helps you live your life than i think that is enough reason to continue using it :-) personally, i use a rollator to help with my fatigue and involuntary movements/gait dysfunction from fnd and my doctors (who are among the few that do not believe in the conversion / mainly psychological theories about fnd) support me using it
I think of it like this: the doctor is considering *one* area of your health. It is much, much healthier for your *overall* health that you use a walker (or another aid) and continue to go out and socialise and go to school and have all these important experiences, than if you just stayed home because you can't walk far without the walker, and you're trying not to use the walker. *That* is the choice you have to make right now.

Personally, I use a stick. I use it as little as I can, but I always have it with me. If I didn't have the stick, I'd have to say no to walks with friends or trips into town because of the fear of what would happen if I lost balance or muscle control. I'd have to put all my weight on my partner again when it got really bad, like I did before I had the stick. It's a horrible feeling being totally reliant on someone else, even someone who loves you. My walking stick lets me rely on me.
If you’re in pain and need support, then have the support. That doctor isn’t living your life, feeling your pain or understanding the difficulties you’re having with walking. You do what you have to do to live as comfortably as you possibly can.
This is really disheartening to hear but unfortunately a very common experience for people with fnd trying to get the help we need. I use a foldable walking stick for my bad days, it's great because i can take it anywhere and I'll use it if needed. But that's most days for me. 

I had a similar experience with my mum involving a walking aid. I had an episode where I couldn't use either of my legs due to weakness(this happens once in a while) and so after talking with my friend who has ME and a whole other myriad of conditions, she offered me her old walker to use on days where neither legs can support myself.

When I brought it up with my mum she said that it was ""dramatic & embarrassing"", ""would just take up space"" and ""a waste of time so don't bother"". She felt like my dad would make a big fuss about it too. So then what am I to do when 3/4 of my body isn't working??? Those episodes don't happen often but I should have a way to deal/live with them when they do happen right? So frustrating.

It took them both a while to accept that I need my stick everyday, your mum will need time to adjust to that new reality too. Just be firm on how you feel about this, its your body, let her know that you need this, that you need her support. Best of luck
Use it when you need it, don’t use it when you don’t need it. Listen to what YOUR body is telling you & adjust accordingly.
Fnd is not the same thing all the time , it’s constantly changing & we need to learn to adapt to those changes to help our body & mind get stronger.
That’s what mobility aids are for. They are called AIDS for a reason, they aid or help you when you need them.
I have two different types of crutches, a walker & a wheelchair.
Sometimes I’ll go through all three in a day, some days nothing at all.

AITAH - because I want to almost sever contact with toxic family ,11,AITAH,"It sounds like you are in a tough situation with difficult family dynamics. I think what's most important is to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. It's not easy to set boundaries and stand up for yourself, especially when it involves family, but it's crucial for your own happiness and well-being. And don't worry about being the ""asshole"" in this situation, because sometimes you have to do what's best for you even if it may not please everyone else. Hang in there and take care of yourself and your 8 year old. Sending love and support your way.
NTAH - It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, especially during a high-risk pregnancy. Don't let anyone bring you down, even if it's family. Surround yourself with positivity and supportive friends, and don't be afraid to set boundaries. As for your son, it's great that his grandmother is supportive of his autism journey, but make sure to prioritize your own well-being first.
Definitely NTAH (Not the A\*\*hole Here). It's completely understandable to want to cut off toxic family members, especially for the sake of your mental health and wellbeing. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and set boundaries, regardless of what your family may think. And kudos to your fiancé for being a supportive partner. Stay strong and keep taking care of yourself!
First of all, I'm sorry for all the challenges you're facing. It sounds like you have a lot going on and it's great that you're seeking help and support. As for your situation with your grandmother, it's important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. If that means limiting contact with her or setting boundaries, then that's what you have to do. It's not worth sacrificing your own happiness for someone else who is causing you stress. And it's great that your fiancé is supportive and encouraging you to make decisions that are best for you. Just remember, it's okay to put yourself first.
NTA - Toxic family members can be draining and harmful to one's mental health. It's understandable that you want to limit contact with your dad's mother, especially for the sake of your high risk pregnancy and your 8 year old with autism. You are not obligated to continue a relationship with someone who does not respect your boundaries and makes you feel bad about yourself. Take care of yourself and your family first, and don't feel guilty for setting boundaries. Your fiance is right, it's your choice and you should do what's best for your well-being.

Healthcare workers support group ,11,Gwinnett,"Not a healthcare provider, but I work peripherally in Public Health and I can see it with many direct care providers. Heck, I am often able to recruit well for PH administration positions  from direct care workers because they have such unfair expectations for patient care, volume and compensation. 

Personally, I have seen many instances of practice admin failing to adequately protect and support their physicians and practitioners. The job market is the job market, but to not have accountable support staff/physician-nurse extenders is an absolute killer for patient throughput and follow up. This is a labor market challenge for many industries, but as you and another commentor mentioned, there is this expectation of customer service as a primary vehicle for care rather than providing quality care. No one went through years of specialized education and schooling to be a customer service rep. 

I am currently in the process of switching my primary care provider here after me and my pharmacy had to call my primary care practice upwards of 5 times to approve a blood pressure medication I've been on for the past decade (I had to get emergency meds from the pharmacy over the weekend due to the lack of response over a 1.5 week period). They also failed to call me to discuss the results of a CT they ordered and only called me once I went to the practice manager (who changed since I started following up over roughly a 2 month period). 

The standard of care has fallen by the wayside in my opinion, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of advocacy on the pieces of the system that helps it to be sustainable (human capital) and we continue to be driven by profits. People are going to continue to get burned out and it's sad to see it happening and feeling like there is nothing we can do.
I work in social services at a SNF in Gwinnett and my job has become increasingly more difficult in the past year. Patients and families completely doing against the advice of clinical staff has been the cause of multiple anxiety attacks. The cost of elderly care specifically has been hard to deal with. I work 50+ hours a week and can’t afford to rent a $1600 apartment but these 80+ year olds living on $1200 from SSI are someone expected to pay $4,000-10,000/month depending on their level of care…
No offense meant, but the vast majority of doctors I've seen in my life have been extremely unhelpful and dismissive of me. I have had to *fight* and *argue* for every single diagnostic test and bloodwork order - which, guess what, *confirmed* what I already knew was the case.

I will never forget my gynecologist in 2010, just minutes before my diagnostic laparoscopy, scoffing that he didn't expect to find anything and would be done in 20 minutes. Almost two hours later, I woke up and he informed me that my uterus was fused to my intestines by endometriosis lesions. Lo and behold, the pain he scoffed at wasn't in my head.

When my thyroid swelled and I could feel that something was wrong, it took *three* different endocrinologists before I found one that took me seriously (outside of Gwinnett!), and she diagnosed me with Hashimoto's - which I had suspected from the beginning, but other doctors dismissed me and said I was fine. I was not fine.

I'm sorry for what you've experienced, but there is a *damn good reason* why patients don't trust doctors now. It's really freaking hard to find a good one that will take patients seriously about genuine health concerns.
My HR literally refers to patients as ""customers"" now and urges staff to do the same.
I’m not a healthcare worker but I am a women who has experienced complete dismissal of major health issues over the years. While I agree drs should the be experts, I’ve typically gotten more feedback via Reddit vs a Dr who charges me a ton and sends me away in 5 mins without listening. Not saying you’re doing this but it’s why we use online tools and have lost trust."
AITA for wanting to move out so i can live with my nephew wich would leave my dad to care for my grandmother all alone ?,11,AITAH,"nta - and just talk to your dad, let him know youre ready to take the next step in life which is  moving out, youre no abandoning him
NTA nobody is actually. you deserve to have a life and make guiltfree choices that benefit your health and happiness. You still are close enough to help when needed and when things get better you may even find parttime caregiver or home cleaning to take that off their list. Choosing for you should not be so hard to do. It does't make you selfish. And there are pleny options to compromise a way to make it work. Good luck to you all and I hope you and yr cousin get to enjoy this next chapter in life :)
NTA. 

But if you do move , and I think you should for all the reasons mentioned, perhaps check with your county about services that could come in to assist them both.  Leaving your dad with some resources may help you feel less upset
NTA. It's alright you want to improve your mental health and live your own life. It's a tough situation, but it's important to prioritize your well-being.
NAH - definitely move out and take care of your mental health. Depending on where you live, inquire with Adult Protective Services about help that both your dad and grandmother is eligible for. I suspect they can get meals brought in, helper care to help bathe etc. Then maybe you commit to 1 night a week to help your father, where he can go out and get a rest, whilst you take care of your grandmother. Talk to him and think about what compromise can be made. Good luck !"

Start by dating yourself just as much as you are dating either of them. Every third night? is a night for yoruself. Go to bed when you want, do what you want. Have time to ground and have friends, or have down time, or get your life stuff done. You need to make time for yourself and your partner's should want to support that. Even if it means they lose some time. Your mental health is fundamental to being a good partner. They should value it as much as you do. 

  
Paul kinda sounds like an ass in all this. He is the experienced poly person and yet is ignoring how hanging out with Kate makes you feel. He's not listening to you when you explain it clearly and he guilts and shames you into spending time around someone who is rude to you and when you can't actually be spending close time with Paul. That's pretty uncomfortable for a LOT of reasons.  

  
I would try and create some boundaries and see if he can respect them. ""Paul if we are sharing time together I want to be able to be partners. I don't need to make out with you in front of Kate but I need it to feel comfortable to hold hands, hug or talk to each other. If that isn't something we can do I want to limit my time around Kate. You say you want more time with me but then plan our time together in ways that means we don't actually get that time together.""

  
I have my doubts about Paul's ability to hinge with respect and care. That's some pretty yucky treatment and some really bad listening.
Take your calendar for October and put all your work/school/commitment things on it.

Next put your self care time on there.  Gym.  Yoga.  Alone time.  SLEEP.  Time for friends if that fills your cup.  For me baths would figure heavily.  And face masks!  And Indian take out.  Zero responsibility time.  Whatever makes you feel you have more energy not less.  

Then see when you can have dates.  You can, perhaps, slightly prioritize Paul in date time since you live with John.  Slightly.  But tell him flat out babe I don’t have enough time in my life to waste time hanging out with Kate’s husband more than once a month.  I will do one thing like that as a group with you IF you agree to hold my hand and act like my boyfriend for some of that time.  If not I won’t do anything like that.  I’m happy to only have one on one dates.  

I’m not open to being pressured about seeing you more.  I’m agreeing to things I can’t really do and you’re calling me a flake for cancelling.  Let’s solve that now.  I’m only agreeing to what’s on the calendar.  I’m committed to poly but I’m not going to keep proving it to you.  

Then tell John I have X slots for scheduled dates with you (ideally this is once a week or more).  We may well get bonus time because we live together but I am only promising this.  Everything else is gravy.  Don’t keep asking me for more, I don’t have it and I can’t be all things to you.  This is poly.  That’s reality.

Keep it all on a calendar.  Cancel things for your own benefit if you must but not for one of them at the expense of the other barring emergency.  

John likely needs to be dating other people or spending more time with his friends or hobbies.  Up to him but it’s NEVER going to be like monogamy.
I know you love them, I don't want to jump straight to dumping both of them, but these men are not treating you well or with respect. They're entitled & demanding, & Paul is self-centered & manipulative as well. I believe in supporting your partners emotionally, but at a certain point, if he's still not showing improvement, it's not your job to convince him you won't leave him for monogamy, & it's his job to figure out how to self-soothe. All you can do is continue to be polyamorous. 

You say you suspect Paul isn't doing a good enough job of reassuring Kate, & that's why she's insecure & hostile towards you. But you've done more than enough to reassure Paul, yet he's still insecure & demanding. It's totally possible he's not a good partner to her & doesn't make her feel secure, especially since he seems pretty self-absorbed, but she might just be stuck on processing her own feelings of jealousy, & a partner can't always do something to help with that. It sounds to me like she might not actually want polyamory (or at least she doesn't want to share).

You've gotten some great advice so far; setting up a calendar, setting boundaries, & limiting the number of dates you have with both men so you can see friends & date yourself. At the rate you're going, you *will* burn out. Be proactive about conserving & rebuilding your resources now, before it's too late. **It's a cliché, but you can't pour from an empty cup. The best way to love these men is to love yourself more.**

Also, to second what others have said, please tell Paul that you won't be manipulated into spending time with Kate again unless you can exchange basic restaurant-appropriate PDA with him. If he can't give you that, fine; you won't spend time as a group. God, the way he attempts to manipulate you makes my blood boil. I hope it's a one-off & he doesn't regularly try to alter your behavior with vague criticisms
""Kate's behavior is making me uncomfortable. I will not intentionally put myself in situations where I am uncomfortable, so I will no longer be spending time with Kate."" Boundary set, ad you're done. And if there's excuses made, like ""you'll miss out on the experience, the fun, etc "" the response is ""this is my decision it's not up for debate.""  Boundaries are non-negotiable. Not up for discussion. You can explain if you choose, but no is a complete sentence 

Imalso, if your partner cannot accept a boundary as simple as this one and continues to try and force KTP, run. No person is worth constant boundary violations."
Season 14 thoughts ,8,WaterlooRoad,"Schuey is being the way he is as he has been given no direction. he's almost lost his sister in his mind and no one cares about him no family members. He's never had a role model but now there's no one to not disappoint so he's able to do what he likes.

I fully agree with your point about Steve though.

the endometriosis storyline was actually portrayed amazingly they don't tend to do those sort of storylines in shows so I loved that they had some representation on it hopefully it doesn't just get forgotten about though
-
I'm not sure where they are going with schuey I also thought he would get a redemption arc after the ending of the last season but it seems they went the other way with it.. I'm not sure if to expect him to go even further next season or what tbh
-
Absolutely loved the deaf storyline too I thought it was very moving honestly this season is probably my favourite from the reboot so far..
I can totally understand why Schuey is like he is. Separated from Portia, his sister who he had protected from their abusive father. He was told by Kim Campbell that she would look after him and so when she stopped being the head teacher it was like a slap in the face to him. Not only all that, he was put in a care home where... Like Boz said, they don't really care about you. 

All I'll say though is I think there should be a few more scenes with him and Portia.
You make some excellent points there!
Tonyas storyline was great. It is exactly what happens when women ask for help. What she was experiencing is NOT normal, and all too often symptoms of illnesses like endometriosis are fobbed off as just ""normal period stuff"". The doctor in a&e was disgraceful and even the female GP!"

Best basic signs to learn for deaf roommate?,8,deaf,"I would recommend taking the questions you asked here and just asking her. She's her own person and what she would prefer may not be what others here prefer.
It sounds like your roommate is fully deaf, so this may not apply but one small thing I tend to ask hearing people to do is when they speak to me, lift their faces enough so I can see them (I’m tall) and don’t be confused if I seem to look at their mouth a lot to track what they’re saying. That may not apply to her but it’s good for any HOH people you may meet in the future. 

Her app sounds very useful, and I’m sure she has plenty of experience with it so try not to worry about breaking it somehow. I’m sure she knows how to troubleshoot stuff like that. If you have the option, perhaps an ASL class might be offered on your campus or nearby - I think even finishing  learning to finger spell could be helpful to you for basic stuff. 

Go by what she says to you! And one minor thing - you note that you’re not sure if she’s deaf or Deaf so I would advise that if you’re a hearing person, Deaf culture can sometimes seem a bit abrupt to outsiders! I only mention that because I know some people with ADHD have higher rejection sensitivity, so try to remember that it’s likely not her being rude, or you being over-sensitive, but rather two cultures mixing.
Hey a bit outside of topic, what’s the benefit of someone with mental health related issues living in a disability residence. I’m curious and want to educate myself a bit more
A lot of signs are more basic than you think. The sign for eat is just holding your fingers together and indicating them towards your mouth, the sign for bag is like you are holding a plastic bag by the handles. Learn to finger spell/the ASL alphabet. Hopefully your roommate is willing to help you all learn, but for sure ask them what they want you all to know (sometimes note writing is the way to go for a while). Good luck!
Does your university offer ASL courses?   That would show your interest or commitment without putting the responsibility on your Deaf roommate"
Deaf peer helper around the world,9,deaf,"Deaf mentor is what we use (America) if this is the same concept you reference.
I’m not sure exactly what you are asking. In Australia we have Deaf support workers which is very common. They are people you can hire through our national disability scheme to assist you with a variety of tasks. They are part of our community and their work isnt really viewed positively or negatively.
Not formally. Here in Sweden there is a strong tradition of associations for sports, hobbies and disabilities. It’s through those we offer communities, support and try to advocate for things. Right now we offer a series of five support sessions called “Befriend your hearing aids”. 

Traditionally support has been provided through the health care services. They have everything from audiologists, ENTS, counseling, psychologists, technicians and sign language teachers to physiotherapists. Maybe 15 years ago, I was at a brilliant week long rehab session where I met others with a similar background. Such things are too expensive now, so there definitely is a switch to putting more burden on the non-government associations.

I’m not aware of how much support is available for parents of Deaf children. Besides parents getting 240 hours free sign language courses. (Which isn’t really enough.)
From India - Nothing formal but there are social groups that people can get help from.
Are you talking about hearing people that help deaf people? I think OP is referring to deaf people who help other deaf people.  Which isn't something we have in the USA,  We do have peer support groups for hoh/deaf people but there's no official or government endorsed system or program for such things."

Allow yourself to grieve. Allow your partner to grieve. And keep an eye on your relationship. While this was an honest mistake it’s the sort of thing where resentment could definitely fester if communication breaks down. 

We lost our cat last year to something traumatic. I will say that now when we look back we don’t think of our worst day. We think of the happy memories. You’ll get there someday.
I’m really sorry this has happened to you guys. Thank you for being vulnerable with us. I hope you will eventually forgive yourself. Yes, it was irresponsible, but you did not do it on purpose, and didn’t have any bad intentions for your little guy. I just want you to know, I don’t think any of this makes you a bad person. And my opinion doesn’t really matter, but I hope you don’t think you’re evil or anything. You clearly feel terrible about it, and to me that says a lot about your character. I wish you both the best 🩷
I’m sorry that this happened, my condolences 🕊️🤍 as time goes on, it’ll become easier for you to handle. It was an accident and you’re not evil and you’re not a bad person. Take your time and grieve. Both of you. I hope all goes well for you guys and your relationship as well.
I’m so sorry this happened to you.  
I don’t think you’re a bad person.  I hope you find some peace and forgive yourself and find the courage to hold on to the happy memories.
Hi OP. I'm so sorry this happened to you. When you're feeling overwhelmed with guilt, remind yourself that you're hurting too. Don't make your hurt hurt worse with the guilt. You loved your dog and they loved you. Full stop. This sucks so much for you. Like another person said in this thread - let yourself grieve. Your partner is going to be sad no matter what you say or do, so let them grieve, too. I get the need to manage their feelings right now and that probably is in part to help ease the guilt. 

I really hope you can ditch the guilt and just let yourself miss your dog. Sending you a big hug."

Pregnant with a reactive dog ,9,reactivedogs,"Behavioral Euthanasia posts are sensitive, thus only users with at least 500 subreddit karma will be able to comment in this discussion. 

Behavioral Euthanasia (BE) for our dogs is an extremely difficult decision to consider. No one comes to this point easily. We believe that there are, unfortunately, cases where behavioral euthanasia is the most humane and ethical option, and we support those who have had to come to that decision. In certain situations, a reasonable quality of life and the [Five Freedoms](https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2018/11/what-are-five-freedoms-and-what-do-they.html) cannot be provided for an animal, making behavioral euthanasia a compassionate and loving choice.    

**If you are considering BE and are looking for feedback:**

All decisions about behavioral euthanasia should be made in consultation with a professional trainer, veterinarian, and/or veterinary behaviorist. They are best equipped to evaluate your specific dog, their potential, and quality of life.

These resources should not be used to replace evaluation by qualified professionals but they can be used to supplement the decision-making process.

The best resource available for people navigating grief after a behavior euthanasia is the [Losing Lulu website](https://www.losinglulu.com/) and [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/losinglulu).

Pregnancy is a special time and being so stressed and upset is effecting you and your unborn child. Is this reactive dog worth more than your health and the baby's safety? Ask your husband that question and if he promises to put safeguards in place, you'll NEVER be 100% perfect and you will absolutely need to be 100% perfect. And it's funny how these  shelters and rescue tell people ""this poor dog was abused and neglected by their former owner"" - it's more likely this dog had issues before your husband adopted him and the shelter created a sob story, which does no one any good.
So what HAS been done for this dog?

Has a trainer been involved at all? Has a vet consult taken place and the behaviours discussed? Have meds been tried?
He’s had the dog for 8 years, and he has definitely gotten worse with age. Although to be honest he’s never been a super chill dog. Most people are afraid of him. It doesn’t help that he’s a pit bull lab mix, so most people have some reservations solely based on that. 

Anyway, yes he is a super stressful dog and I think I’m OK now while pregnant but I’m very afraid when the baby is born.
You sound very stressed, and that definitely will affect your pregnancy. Maybe talk to your doctor about this and explain the perspective and I would say that they can explain how maternal health is so incredibly important from conception to birth. Allowing a dog to rule the household and damage your personal life isn't good for anyone. You will grieve for a bit If you decide to go the BE route, but not long after that you will wake up feeling stronger and more focused on the important things in life. You need to keep perspective and keep things in priority order: If you wrote up a list of things that are important in your life, the pets should be at least four or five things down, unless it's a service dog that helps with your mental health, not harms it."
Worried about making a complaint to my union?,6,AFSCME,"I hope you luck and I wish I had something meaningful to contribute. My local is filled with incompetent money grabbers and fail to even reply to emails. I had to speak to management for a resolution. If it’s possible I would see if you can possibly seek a transfer
Best of luck brother , having my own issues with this same union. Iv gone up to the national level and can't get any one to lift a single finger to do what they are being paid to do.
For a first step in making contact - check out your own local contact into at:

[https://www.afscme.org/local](https://www.afscme.org/local)

As soon as you talk to a real person anywhere around your own local, tell them that you want contact info for your member action center.  That should help to get you in touch with consistent representation and info updates in the event that your local is not correctly furnishing those things.
AFSCME completely failed to protect me when I was written up for my opinions given on a mandatory survey. Our rep had quit and those above him failed tremendously to assign someone to help up or inform us pretty much right when this happened. I didn’t know I only had two weeks to fight it. One creepy guy from above in ASCME finally came to one of our meetings and put his hand on my knee and shifted blame on me and my coworkers, all who have not been well supported over the years.
I was coming to ask a similar question. AFSCME is completely ignoring me and my colleagues regarding abusive management practices and a whole bunch of things that are grievance. People are quitting, taking early retirement, taking long leaves, etc.  It’s completely demoralizing and of course affects our ability to do our jobs. 

There’s a lot of big talk from stewards about the need to be together and present a united front, strength in numbers, and the importance of joining the union. We’ve united! We are union members! Yet get ignored, retaliated against, and made examples of by management. Others don’t want to involve the union because they see what’s happened to us. 

Union has made some piddling efforts to communicate with management but get ignored, and nothing changes. Where do we go when our union won’t help us? Management sees the union as a joke. Understandably so. 

Note: when we leave the State, we are no longer paying dues! You’d think that would spark some concerns. Management seems determined to run us all off through retaliation and constructive discharge."
AITAH for not loving my mother anymore,5,AITAH,"Your mom makes you and your home unsafe.  She is violent.  You have every right to cut her off
You're not the asshole for protecting your own well-being and feeling unsafe, especially given the abuse and mental health struggles you've endured.
NTA. Your safety must come first, and if that means keeping distance from your mother, then that's what's necessary. A common misconception is that blood ties require you to endure all forms of treatment with grace, but that's not the case. It's sad that she's not taking her medication, but it isn't your responsibility to bear the burden of her choices—especially when they lead to violence. You might be young, but you have the right to a safe environment. Consider documenting these incidents if you haven't already, and seriously consider reaching out to social services if you're in danger. Remember, it's not about assigning blame to your mom for her illness, but about taking steps to ensure your own wellbeing and that of your siblings. Stay strong.
NTA. Your mother is the AH. I understand that she is sick, but she is making the decision to not take her meds which unfortunately is all too common with people in her situation.  As soon as they feel better, they go off. Your mom needs to understand that there are consequences to her actions and it's your dad's job to deal with that not yours. Currently you are in a dangerous situation that could go bad at any time as shown by her choking you out. Tell your dad about that because if she can go that far she could go farther. Please talk to an adult not only for your safety but the safety of your siblings because if she can target you, she can easily target them.  I wish you the best of luck.
NTA

Your mother is severely abusive. She's a threat to your physical and mental wellbeing.

While it's not her fault she's sick, it IS her fault she isn't taking her medication.

You're doing the right thing by standing up for yourself and protecting yourself from further abuse."

10 months in does it get better?,5,TinnitusTalk,"it can still completely go away!!!!!
I’m in a similar situation for a shorter amount of time, from one concert about a month ago. T, hyperacusis, aural fullness, and slight noxacusis which happens randomly … perhaps some other elements as well. Encountering loud noises makes my ears feel full of water (aural fullness), since having that happen a couple times I’ve essentially been avoiding all noise which probably isn’t healthy, idk. I’m worried anything will make it worse. I’ve ordered some transparent earplugs to wear whenever I’m outside/not in a quiet place. Every day feels like a hellish uphill battle.

Welcoming any tips or long term success stories
Am on my first week with it , Till now I don't know what caused it I was so protective of my ears, but I got it anyway it sucks, am also from north Africa where exactly do u live  we could be tinnitus neighbors lol
Are you taking any medication or supplements? 

Most all prescribed medications make the ringing much worse for me. I’ve started taking some supplements and I feel like they are helping to heal faster.
Hey hope u are doing well now.(sorry for my english it's not my native language) 
I've been struggling with tinnitus since I was 15 years old, now I'm 23, I visited many doctors here in Morocco but no one helped me or gived me a clue. So after struggling with it at that young age, I started to accept it, I kept myself busy all day. I tried many exercises I found on the internet, but after like 3 years I barely notice it. In the night when I'm alone I try to keep myself distracted with music or anything playing in the background. 
U just have to live with it accept it and keep urself busy all day."
Not sure where to post this because I AM an asshole,4,AITAH,"Sounds like the only thing that got stuffed was this post with way too much detail. But in all seriousness, this is a serious issue and it sounds like your sister needs some tough love and a reality check. Maybe try showing her some articles or studies about the impact of childhood obesity and how her actions (or lack thereof) are contributing to it. And keep reinforcing positive behaviors with your niece and nephew, like eating healthy snacks and being active. It takes a village and if your sister won't listen, then be the positive role model for her kids.
Thank you. I keep telling myself I’m going to spend more time with them and then I don’t do it. I have zero patience as my major depression is intense rn. I will probably pick them up more now though, ad I have a reliable car again. And I will make more of an effort on my end. I have sent her articles. It seems like a perfect way of communicating concern without being direct, but to no avail. I did the toughest of love a while ago (edit: went into detail about my concerns and her part to play) . I even once said her parenting wasn’t much less than what some get CPS called on them for, she just got super angry at me and we didn’t talk for a while. You wouldn’t get it you’re not a mom poor me boo hoo. I guess I’ll just be more honest and if she doesn’t like it that’s not my problem. I hate to stand by and watch it continue to worsen. I personally do my best to teach them about healthy eating and habits, and I prioritize being active and eating good Whole Foods already. I just feel like it has zero effect because they go back home to sodas and chips and all sorts of junk and laziness and filth.
It really was a jam packed post. I was in a mood when I posted this and got totally sidetracked.
They only like junk. When they’re at my house, I offer different fruits, veggies and dip, fruit bars, nuts, fermented snacks, all sorts of healthy snacks. Zero interest. They say I have “no food” and only want to eat the snacks that are utter junk. And I don’t even keep much junk as I like to bake and make my snacks at home usually so I know what’s in it. I feel like I try my best to exemplify healthy habits and then they’re at home practicing anything but that"

I’m really sorry you’re facing all this. It sounds incredibly challenging, especially with your mental health and physical issues. It’s important to take care of yourself first, even if that means delaying things like college. Try to get support from mental health professionals who can understand your needs and communicate in a way that works for you. If you’re struggling with anxiety and isolation, reaching out to support groups or online communities might help you feel less alone. It’s okay to take things one step at a time and focus on your well-being before diving into new commitments.

I'd take the dog to the vet to rule out any potential health issues causing his increase in aggression.  Otherwise, they can advise of or prescribe a daily calming aid.  I'd definitely do this ASAP because you want to make sure it all takes effect and works before baby is born.  A partially blind and deaf older dog who has never been around a newborn before can be extremely dangerous.  If vet rules doggy is in pain and medication doesn't help,  then euthanasia before baby's birth would be the humane option.  I'm sorry you are going through this 😔
He actually had an appointment this week to decide if we are removing one of his eyes becusee there is a tumor growing behind it. That’s why he’s blind in that eye. So I will ask the vet if we can try out a medication for him. He’s always been anxious and somewhat aggressive but I don’t think the tumor pushing on his eye is helping any"
My gf is struggling and I don’t know what to do,2,Advice,">I think she needs professional help

You have it right there. This is an issue that is far past anything you could even attempt to fix. 

She needs serious medical/psychological intervention and she needs it now."
how did you make the decision to get/not to get hearing aids as an adult? (mini vent),2,deaf,"With a good audiologist you should be able to test out a few devices to find the right one. But I think that’s a step ahead of you. What you could do is talk with them, try a device that suits you for a few weeks (maybe some you don’t plan to view ur mother in) and then decide if they helped or not. 
If you feel like other symptoms you have are overwhelming the assistance of hearing aids, you are back here. 
If they helped you and you had less problems understanding. Congrats. 

I don’t really know what to answer to your problems about internal ableism. I either don’t have or ignored it all my life without knowing. But I love my hearing aids. I love how they look and feel. The ear moulds glow in the dark and they are nice and blue. 

I hope my first part helped you a bit
It can be really isolating if you don't if you already have had hearing most of your life.

I always tell people that you're your own biggest advocate. If your mum is that toxic is it worth keeping a relationship with her when  you can't use something to benefit/enrich your life better?

I think some of this needs unpacking with a therapist as well ideally with someone who has a interest in the Deaf/HoH field.

I can talk, I can lipread, I can also sign. I still make the world accommodate for me with my hearing aids, not the other way around. I know my rights and know what I need and deserve.
I saw my friend get isolated by other 'friends' because she was slow on the uptake for jokes and other conversations. They laughed behind her back that she was always clueless. I always spoke up for her. She didn't realise she had hearing loss and when we looked back after she got hearing aids we realised the reasons she was always one step behind the conversation was hearing loss. It can be isolating.
When I started getting hearing loss I read up about it that untreated hearing loss is a dementia risk too. So for my health and in solidarity with my friend I embraced HAs and I decorate mine and talk about wearing them as much as I can to help remove the stigma
The good news is that you can choose to wear your hearing aids when you want to…. Or not. 

If you have the resources I recommend that you get them and then experiment with wearing them when and where you feel comfortable and you’ll figure it out. 

Don’t let anyone tell you when to wear them or why. You make the choice.
I have an auditory processing disorder. I wear hearing aids. I know sign language. 

Before I got my hearing aids, when I get a cold, I start to “hear better” because there is less background noise. With the auditory processing you were likely working hard to hear, loosing the hearing might mean that your brain has to work less on filtering and more on filling in the missing holes. 

I don’t wear my hearing aids all day, but I do wear them when I leave the house and then I may take them off when I arrive at my destination (rare), or leave them on. 

You can always do a free trial and see if you like them. All you’ve done is collect data."
AITA for cutting contact with my mom after she mistreated my sister again?,2,okstorytime,"NTA - Some people are not redeemable, and you are forced to separate yourself for your own (and loved one's) protection.

Maybe she will get the help she needs, maybe she will turn her life around, but it will have to be without you.  Stay away.  Keep your sister away.  Keep your child away.  Who knows what she would do if given access to a third generation.
I have a similar relationship with my mother. I let her back in when I was pregnant, and regret it deeply. Background: 6 girls, I am the oldest. From oldest to youngest, she has made same mistakes not learning from them at all. She made life miserable for my father since they were divorced (3 children w him) and currently divorcing my step father (3 kids with him). Dragging us all in, verbally abusing now that we are too old to physically abuse. It's so painful when you have a mother like this, but she's a narcissist and will never change. When a person gets chance after chance, still making same mistakes and causing you more grief than happiness, best to go your own way and cut ties. Hard but in long run, you will both be happier
That is a good point.

I tried to make it a working relationship for my children, to let them have atleast one grandparent on their mothers side. (They recently lost they paternal grandmother through a horrible accident and miss her alot)  
  
My mom has always complained that there´s no deep relationship between her and my three children and blames distance and her troubles hearing and seeing for this.  
The truth is she´s hard to connect with and the last time she was here she has more interation then ever before with my kinds and I thought thing would change....  
I later found out that she complained that my kinds were ""pestering her and beeing to loud"" 

Nope. Not ok. You are no longer welcome in my house if my kids can't be kids.

It sucks when her father was the best grandparent ever and basically raised me. Always beeing there for me, teaching me that I had worth and how to navigate life.
I'm sorry you had to go through that. I know what it feels like them grownups drag children into adult conversations...

I struggle with this thinking that my sister is the bigger person for letting this go, this happned to her and she can forgive. I feel like maybe I should do the same?  
But I will ALWAYS chose my sister over my mother and will defend her into eternity since she can't stand up for herself."

Someone as fearful as she is probably could use the assistance of a life guide of a sort (who isn't also a romantic partner). It's kind of a shame this best friendship has become romantic because a romance cannot under any circumstances be the only relationship in someone's life. That's damaging and it makes people feel trapped, isolated and stuck. She needs other influences and if you truly had her best interests at heart you'd try to help her find those. Even if it was just an art class or something. She needs to not be so dependent on you (and you need to not draw so much of your own identity from being needed by her). The situation you describe is just unhealthy and likely to combust at some point.
Bro she loves u a lot dont lose her as she obviously cares about u . Don try to make such joke's in the future and assure her that u won't. As ur getting therapy i hope u get those thoughts behind and fix urself. If u continue to want to die or joke about it again u will lose her . Better urself and assure her u won't ever joke or want to die .Better wife her up in the future."
Friend is dead set on being in a relationship that he is not ready for.,1,FriendshipAdvice,"Just remember you are only 1 year older than him, so not to dismiss your own experiences but you are both still so young and still have so much to learn from what life experiences are yet to come, both good and bad. 

Maybe he should ask this girl out and see what she says, just because she has mental health issues and just because he does as well doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be worthy of love. Maybe it might be something that they can share common ground on and help each other with. 

I can see you care deeply about your friend and only want what’s best for him, but you’re only 17 yourself so you may not know what’s best for him, hell he may not even know what’s best for him but that’s life. Sometimes things work out and sometimes they don’t. Sometimes we have the best experiences and sometimes it feels like the whole word is crushing us into the ground. 

As you get older you will realised that and realises that sometimes you have to step outside your comfort zone and ask the pretty girl out. 

If you feel that his mental health is that bad that any rejection could be detrimental beyond the standard “broken heart and life sucks” mentality then maybe instead of trying to deter him from doing what you think he should do, instead talk to him about the possible outcomes of what he wants to do. Ask him how he thinks he might feel if she didn’t feel the same way, ask him what he thinks would happen if they dated for a while and broke up etc. and remind him that no matter what happens it’s not the end of the world, and that you being his friend will always be there for him. 

I would also maybe encourage him to talk to a professional about his mental health too, it sounds as though he needs to given he is having panic attacks. Is he able to talk to his parents about this? Or a teacher? Or a trusted adult, as it’s also a lot for another young person like yourself to have to provide emotional support like that for.
No, he won't talk to a mental health professional. I was actually just talking to him about that. He hates his parents and doesn't trust them with his issues, and quite frankly, I wouldn't either, they aren't the most supportive. When I asked him why he wouldn't go to counseling, he told me that it's because ""he doesn't need to get better; They either drug the shit out of you, or send you to the loon box"". Having been sent to the ""loon box"" myself, I told him counselors can't prescribe medication or put you in a place unless they have reason to believe you may be a danger to yourself or others, something in which he is not. 

He also told me that he doesn't want to change because he's ""rationalized"" his problems, and that it's ""not fun so why would I want to do it"". His rationalizations seem to contradict themselves every few sentences, and fundamentally he doesn't see that his problems are genuinely a danger to his well-being, quite literally physically with his heart rate issues. 

Another thing about the girl and him, I'm not saying they aren't deserving of love, but she's definitely not the type you'd want to date. Like I said she has a very long list of mental problems, and there's usually an episode with her every week or so, it can include extreme emotional episodes or dangerous suicidal urges, and that is just not healthy for someone to be in a relationship with, I and several other of my friends have been in that situation, and it was unhealthy for both sides involved every time. 


I'm probably jumping to conclusions too quick, but im terrified to see how this might affect him given how he's taken situations like this previously rather poorly. 

It's tearing me apart inside right now because I feel like I'm being too much of a nag and that I might not be doing the right thing, or that I'm doing it in the wrong way and doing the wrong things. I've seen several friends experience, and have experienced myself what he's going through right now, and I am so damn scared of what he might do.

It really sucks because after a lot of therapy and clinicals and other stuff related to that I have been doing the best I have been in years, but as I've come out of my dark area, I'm watching my best friend go into his. 

I really don't want to hear that I'm probably not gonna be able to help him and I'm just gonna have to let things play out, but unfortunately there's nothing much more I can do than that. I just really worry and hope everything goes well which it doesn't seem like it is for him right now.

I can only speak on my experience with dementia and not the potential personality disorders. For my mother, she had a brain injury which changed the way she viewed things, a lot more fearful and negative. As she aged, we noticed the onset of dementia. This combination made her very anxious and the traditional medication did not seem to help. What finally did help was anti-anxiety medication which helped calm her down and take the edge off. This made her easier to live with and she started to enjoy life a bit more. It will likely take some trial and error, with both anti-anxiety and depression medication to help your father. It took awhile for us to find the right combination and we always presented it vitamins, rather than medicine, which she accepted. Good luck !"

>and often has an angry outburst.

That's his emotion and that's why he guards his emotions.
In every relationship you're going to encounter characteristics where you two are incompatible.

I think you for you, you need to ask yourself if this is too extreme of a difference to make it work long term.

Its possible to work on, but is it too big of an issue... This does hold a heavy weight early on. I kind of expect to hear about this sort of things years into the relationship, not within the first months.

You had a heart to heart the other day and it didn't go smoothly.

Heart to hearts should go smoothly. All you're trying to do is communicate improvement.

I'll be honest, I am not perfect displaying my emotions. But its something my wife wants out of me and I can recognize its a problem. I can accept my partners experience and agree with it.

But your bf... He doesn't put himself in your shoes, nor recognizes it as an issue.... That's impossible to work with long term. You need someone who can drop the ego and attempt to see it from your angle.

And I really didn't like the fact that you opened up about your depression and he made you the butt end of a joke shortly after. That ain't cool and is out of touch with you as a person.

I feel that these are some heavy hitting issues that just shouldn't be experienced this early on. To me, its something about years deep with a person. Its too early to be dealing with this kind of weight IMO."

> with Deaf youth who are navigating identity struggles


That's awfully narrow for a scope.


 Hoh/Deaf youth need hoh/deaf adult role models. There is nothing you as a hearing person can do for them in this context. I'm speaking from first hand experience. I was once a hoh youth and therapy I had back then did fuck all for me. 


I have to ask, why the focus on identity?
I would advise researching the importance of cultural competence and how having your identity reflected in your provider improves client outcomes. Sometimes the best thing you can do for a client is refer them elsewhere to another provider who would be a better fit.
hi there! i hope you’re well, as someone who fairly recently lost some hearing and saw a hearing therapist- i would definitely recommend Deaf/HOH patients to Deaf/HoH therapists. Not only do I feel more connected in therapy, I don’t have to provide context for certain things and I can focus on working on my issues rather than crossing that hearing gap, I hope this helps somewhat! it’s great that you’re trying to understand and are actively engaging in our culture :))

AITA For Going No Contact With My Immediate Family?,0,FamilyIssues,"No you’re not the asshole. I can completely relate to family treating you like they’re taking advantage of you.. and they probably are. Going no contact isn’t that easy for me, and I guess I’m blessed that I didn’t because I just lost my dad in April and had only been making my own boundaries so my family couldn’t hurt me as much… but it’s still never easy. Not that my dad was the problem but again he wasn’t the answer either so it’s very hard to find a medium to family members. I’m here to just say you wouldn’t want to regret something when they’re actually gone too…. You need to definitely stand your ground and speak up about paying the phone then. Or what ever issues you want addressed. Tell them where and what grounds you stand on because at the end of every single day you only have one family, you make other families (work,college ect) but still family…..

A toxic person infiltrated my friend group,0,Advice,"I don't understand why you wouldn't just cut her off?   That seems to me to be the only option unless you create a new group for the 'safe' people and exclude her from it which is pretty much the same thing.  Some people are toxic, this is your group (you are the common element), I think you need to be courageous here and be the leader others want you to be
Thanks for reading all of this. I am essentially trying to cut her off, but I think I would become toxic if I tried to control who my friends hang out with. We've been speaking of making plans and taking trips together. I'm asking from an autistic point of view because I don't know. Wouldn't it be controlling for me to say, ""Let's all go do this. OH, and Mary can't come.""

Or even ""Yeah! I'll come to your game night! As long as Mary can't come.""

Are you saying you think I should remove her from the Discord? 

I admit. I am scared to do that. Right now, here's my thought. If I remove her when she hasn't technically done anything against the guidelines, I will lose the trust of the rest of my friends, and it will become a ""piss OP off and get banned"" situation.
You can’t control who other people are friends with, so if you want to separate yourself then do it. It sounds like while she does some things that bother them, it’s not enough for them to drop her as a friend.
Leadership is hard.   But this clearly is bothering you so you have to do something.   Is there any option to talk privately to one or 2 wise people in the group and ask their advice?   Be very careful only to state facts not opinions, then if anything you say is repeated back to her you know you were on solid ground.
I have been trying to separate myself from her but not my friends, which makes this hard. I feel like if I just drop all of my friends for not dropping her, I'll be doing myself a disservice. I'll also just be abandoning people when things get hard, which is just avoiding my problems."

I think the lists are fairly self explanatory, they’re comparable because they’re all disabilities what’s not computing ?

( whether it’s a good idea to disclose disabilities is a different kettle of fish …)
So they’re equal in their impact on work? Or consideration for special arrangements? If I have ADHD I’m the same as a blind person with no limbs? 

I’m in a client facing role. I don’t think dwarfism is the same thing as schizophrenia or why we’re discussing it before we meet. 

Maybe if I understand the purpose? Is it for special accommodation? Liability? Reporting? 

Which leads to that other kettle of fish. And why we’re keeping it in a kettle.
Assuming you’re in America, They’re all disabilities that qualify for accommodations under the Americans with disabilities act and/or section 504 of the rehabilitation act. Not every disabled person is going to need the same workplace accommodations (obviously) and there are some roles where a disabled person may need accommodations vs roles where they might not.

The question is asked because of reporting requirements set out by the EEOC to measure disparate impact on disabled individuals in the workplace. For example if it is known that company X average 30% applicants with disabilities, and yet only 3% of their workforce is disabled, there may be biases resulting in disabled candidates being overlooked due to their disability.
Yes this is US specific. 

That’s all well in a world without discrimination. The US is bad enough with employee rights and regulations without me giving them reason to trash my resume because I may have fucking IBS vs no ability to see or hear. They’re not even in the same universe."

LHA (local housing allowance) is the amount set by council for properties which is paid via UC.

 The next part, I think to apply for ESA it's through the UC process which would be applying then waiting 5 weeks for a payment if no sanction.They used to saction something like 3 months for voluntary leaving your job/making yourself unemployed I don't know if they do the same length of time now
Thank you, but as I mentioned before - i was signed off with stress due to the job. And I'm spiralling back to how I was before I got signed off. Can you explain why I can't apply for LHA?
Thank you for explaining to me 😊"
PIP - change of circumstances or mandatory reconsideration ,0,BenefitsAdviceUK,"There's been a weird influx of questions related to hearing loss and mobility. The consensus is that it's incredibly difficult to score for mobility and deafness. I wouldn't risk enhanced DL and standard mobility without specialist face to face advice.
If it’s deteriorated then that’s a change of circumstance. If you believe the initial decision was wrong and he should have got enhanced based on his conditions at the time then it’s an MR.
Yes !  I wonder if there's been an article elsewhere.
It wouldn’t just be based on his deafness, it’d be based on his mental health. I wouldn’t entirely feel comfortable applying for it if it was just for his deafness as I do feel like what he has is too good to get, if you get me. However, he has significant mental health issues and I know that people are able to claim on this grounds. 

!thank you!
Thank you, that has helped me to understand a bit more about it! What I may recommend him to do though is to seek advices from a specialist professional."
