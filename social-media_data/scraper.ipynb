All over the world casual anti semitism was suddenly normalized. In my personal opinion Before Oct 7 we Jews generally felt that both the memory of the Holocaust and the existence of the state of Israel were somehow providing us with a shield against anti semitism and we felt pretty confident about being Jewish in the various countries we live in. With the attacks and the overt antisemitism that was unleashed, that feeling dissipated. One reason it might be difficult to get police to react is that in recent years there has been huge effort to police hate crimes against minorities and LGBT folk but because Jews have been so well integrated in society and have not been experiencing significant hate  crimes a generation of law enforcement has not been dealing with this issue. We all have to adjust to this new reality and it is possible the hate will end when the war ends.\\nIngrained racism and antisemitism take time to uproot, and from everything I have read, I think that is a problem in the UK right now.

If this is not something she agreed to do one day, I think it makes sense that she might not be ready to make the move ASAP. That being said, maybe you need to tell her this is really important to you, and make it clear you need her to consider the possibility. Someone mentioned couples counseling, and I think that\\'s a great idea.\\n\\n\\nI get her having complicated feelings about family. As someone who has had my own struggles and has a partner with a tight knit family, I doubt she doesn\\'t \"get\" it. I\\'m guessing it might bring up difficult feelings for her. It\\'s painful to be faced with the love and support that you never received. But as your partner she should also want what\\'s best for you... And hopefully she can work through these challenges in therapy.\\n\\n\\nCanada is a bit of a shit show. I don\\'t know where exactly you want to move - I\\'m sure the situation varies province to province, but cost of living is crazy, housing is unaffordable and healthcare is a mess. She would be lucky to find a family doctor, let alone the mental health supports she needs. I would really consider this aspect of things - consider what she needs and see if you can make a plan. Can you pay privately for therapy? Are there psychiatrists you can get her referred to? Consider what supports she\\'s receiving and whether you are able to access these supports in the community you are planning to move to.\\nThis might be something to go to couples counseling about, since previous attempts to communicate about it seem to be her not taking it as seriously as you do. I agree with others, I don‚Äôt like that sometimes it ends with her getting comfort from you but I think a third party could help change the dynamic and help you get more to the root of the issue.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0I relate to this a lot. I also moved away from my family‚Äînot as far as I used to live but at one point my goal was just to get far away because that‚Äôs what I needed for my independence. I don‚Äôt regret that at all but I also dated someone with few family connections, and realised I was thinking my idea of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to be close to my family‚Äù was me comparing myself to people I grew up with who now live next door to their parents. I have zero desire to live in my hometown, but I DO value those relationships a lot and I am glad I live closer now that my parents are also getting older. Anyway, back to my ex. This wasn‚Äôt a factor in our breakup, but sometimes it felt like they just didn‚Äôt comprehend why I would want to see my parents and childhood friends so often, why my parents would help me out with stuff (and vice versa), or even why I was talking to my parents about stuff in my daily life (they would think it‚Äôs none of my parents‚Äô business bc THEIR parents didn‚Äôt care). It was like, I don‚Äôt need you to be BFFs with everyone else in my life, but we couldn‚Äôt even cross over the bridge of them understanding why I even had those relationships in the first place. And I wanted them to care a little more, like maybe remembering my family members‚Äô names after years of dating. Anyway, it was just an ongoing low level frustration that I didn‚Äôt really register I was dealing with until after our breakup. Again, this isn‚Äôt why we broke up and things were improving in some aspects so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily something I would‚Äôve broken up about either, more like almost a cultural difference that I think we could‚Äôve put more effort into addressing‚Ä¶ and honestly something I‚Äôll be looking to avoid in my next relationship.\\xa0\\n>Every time I see them, they\\'re a little older.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/solarpunk) if you have any questions or concerns.*\\nThere are aspects of this we are prepared for, I sign and encourage everyone to learn. It improves accessibility for both the deaf and neurodivergent. That doesn\\'t answer your question.\\n\\nI\\'ve talked with therapists and ABAs, there exists a point where children in these extremes just get trained to comply. I don\\'t like that, it treats a human like a misbehaving pet, but our society doesn\\'t provide other options for parents. The parents are ultimately just required to comply too.\\n\\nThe gift solarpunk could give is nuance and patience. Almost all the aspects of solarpunk are about nuance, that we can make things better and minimize harm. That you could be part of a community that could both welcome you and make space for your child. That the question of, \"what do they need to grow\" could be asked instead of \"How could they be made to stop or go away\"\\n\\nYou won\\'t ever be \"normal\" or in a normal situation. I\\'m hoping we get better at accepting that \"normal\" isn\\'t a real thing for anyone, but how you and your child fit into society may never be what you want it to be. We can try to make a place for y\\'all to be weird with the rest of us and do our best.\\nIn addition to what others have said in this thread, I think it‚Äôs also interesting to think that in a Solarpunk society, it‚Äôs possible that some of the stressful triggers for your son‚Äôs behaviors may no longer exist (for example: a loud shopping mall, or the pressures of the school system, or even the language which we use to describe certain things in the space around us which could be triggering for him) as well as the possibility that practices which soothe and help alleviate some of the need for his sedatives/hospitalizations have - in this future - become much more commonplace, so he may find his everyday existence to be much more peaceful than what it is under our current system. \\n\\nAgain, I don‚Äôt know your kid, I‚Äôm not a psychologist, and this is all speculation, but it‚Äôs a comforting thought, at least to me.\\n\\n\\nEdit: typo.\\nAre you asking how a fictional solarpunk society would handle this or are you asking for RL solutions that fit solarpunk philosophy?\\nOn the way to becoming a teacher, I volunteered at a county board of developmental disabilities, so I worked as a caregiver and basic teacher for individuals across age ranges with significant disabilities, primarily intellectual, and secondly musculoskeletal. There were a lot of things at that place I thought were great. Many, many, many adults working with individuals, giving them enriching experiences, and slowly, slowly making progress. Some students slowly gained the knowledge and skills to maybe, possibly get a job and at least somewhat support themselves, but... the frankly darker reality was that many of the children and young adults I worked with were so facing such exceptionality, that... they\\'d be dependent on their family caregivers for their entire lives. And that\\'s just, such a heavy damn thing.\\n\\nThat board of developmental disabilities surrounded our students with teachers, and caregivers, and sought to give them enriching experiences. But, there was an unspoken acknowledgement of the fact that the families, and parents depended on us to watch and supervise their children so they could work to support their children back. I think the hope in a Solarpunk world lies in that issue: People shouldn\\'t have to work just to afford to keep themselves, and their people alive. I know for certain that the vast majority of parents would rather spend more time being with their child, and exploring treatments if available, and if not, living enriching lives, than working 50 hours a week just to have an insurance company say their immobile child doesn\\'t deserve a wheelchair, fuck.\\n\\nSo, for one, Solarpunk, and broadly post-capitalist communities afford us time. But, autonomous, communalist, or anarchist communities afford space. If families in need are allowed the time, and space, they will form communities, and in every community there are those that live lives of service, and can offer their time as caregivers. If everyone isn\\'t bogged down circling the drain of poverty, there will be an unbelievable amount of time and space for flexibility to be afforded. So there is hope, but no amount of hope dispels the difficult reality that exceptional disability poses both those affected, and their caregivers alongside them. I think, regardless of the economic or social framework we live under, doing the right thing for those affected takes a lot of work and struggle.\\n\\nAll power to you.'},\n",

       "  'comments': 'fnd being a mental illness / psychological condition is an unfortunate misconception many doctors have\\n\\nfnd can be affected by your mental health, of course, but so can things like parkinson‚Äôs and heart disease\\n\\nfnd is a real neurological condition (and even if it was entirely psychological), your pain is real and if using a mobility aid helps you live your life than i think that is enough reason to continue using it :-) personally, i use a rollator to help with my fatigue and involuntary movements/gait dysfunction from fnd and my doctors (who are among the few that do not believe in the conversion / mainly psychological theories about fnd) support me using it\\nI think of it like this: the doctor is considering *one* area of your health. It is much, much healthier for your *overall* health that you use a walker (or another aid) and continue to go out and socialise and go to school and have all these important experiences, than if you just stayed home because you can\\'t walk far without the walker, and you\\'re trying not to use the walker. *That* is the choice you have to make right now.\\n\\nPersonally, I use a stick. I use it as little as I can, but I always have it with me. If I didn\\'t have the stick, I\\'d have to say no to walks with friends or trips into town because of the fear of what would happen if I lost balance or muscle control. I\\'d have to put all my weight on my partner again when it got really bad, like I did before I had the stick. It\\'s a horrible feeling being totally reliant on someone else, even someone who loves you. My walking stick lets me rely on me.\\nIf you‚Äôre in pain and need support, then have the support. That doctor isn‚Äôt living your life, feeling your pain or understanding the difficulties you‚Äôre having with walking. You do what you have to do to live as comfortably as you possibly can.\\nThis is really disheartening to hear but unfortunately a very common experience for people with fnd trying to get the help we need. I use a foldable walking stick for my bad days, it\\'s great because i can take it anywhere and I\\'ll use it if needed. But that\\'s most days for me. \\n\\nI had a similar experience with my mum involving a walking aid. I had an episode where I couldn\\'t use either of my legs due to weakness(this happens once in a while) and so after talking with my friend who has ME and a whole other myriad of conditions, she offered me her old walker to use on days where neither legs can support myself.\\n\\nWhen I brought it up with my mum she said that it was \"dramatic & embarrassing\", \"would just take up space\" and \"a waste of time so don\\'t bother\". She felt like my dad would make a big fuss about it too. So then what am I to do when 3/4 of my body isn\\'t working??? Those episodes don\\'t happen often but I should have a way to deal/live with them when they do happen right? So frustrating.\\n\\nIt took them both a while to accept that I need my stick everyday, your mum will need time to adjust to that new reality too. Just be firm on how you feel about this, its your body, let her know that you need this, that you need her support. Best of luck\\nUse it when you need it, don‚Äôt use it when you don‚Äôt need it. Listen to what YOUR body is telling you & adjust accordingly.\\nFnd is not the same thing all the time , it‚Äôs constantly changing & we need to learn to adapt to those changes to help our body & mind get stronger.\\nThat‚Äôs what mobility aids are for. They are called AIDS for a reason, they aid or help you when you need them.\\nI have two different types of crutches, a walker & a wheelchair.\\nSometimes I‚Äôll go through all three in a day, some days nothing at all.\\nYou do you !'},\n",

The job market is the job market, but to not have accountable support staff/physician-nurse extenders is an absolute killer for patient throughput and follow up. This is a labor market challenge for many industries, but as you and another commentor mentioned, there is this expectation of customer service as a primary vehicle for care rather than providing quality care. No one went through years of specialized education and schooling to be a customer service rep. \\n\\nI am currently in the process of switching my primary care provider here after me and my pharmacy had to call my primary care practice upwards of 5 times to approve a blood pressure medication I\\'ve been on for the past decade (I had to get emergency meds from the pharmacy over the weekend due to the lack of response over a 1.5 week period). They also failed to call me to discuss the results of a CT they ordered and only called me once I went to the practice manager (who changed since I started following up over roughly a 2 month period). \\n\\nThe standard of care has fallen by the wayside in my opinion, but there doesn\\'t seem to be a whole lot of advocacy on the pieces of the system that helps it to be sustainable (human capital) and we continue to be driven by profits.

I work 50+ hours a week and can‚Äôt afford to rent a $1600 apartment but these 80+ year olds living on $1200 from SSI are someone expected to pay $4,000-10,000/month depending on their level of care‚Ä¶\\nNo offense meant, but the vast majority of doctors I\\'ve seen in my life have been extremely unhelpful and dismissive of me.

I was not fine.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry for what you\\'ve experienced, but there is a *damn good reason* why patients don\\'t trust doctors now.

You will grieve for a bit If you decide to go the BE route, but not long after that you will wake up feeling stronger and more focused on the important things in life. You need to keep perspective and keep things in priority order: If you wrote up a list of things that are important in your life, the pets should be at least four or five things down, unless it\\'s a service dog that helps with your mental health, not harms it.'},\n",

       "  'comments': \"With a good audiologist you should be able to test out a few devices to find the right one. But I think that‚Äôs a step ahead of you. What you could do is talk with them, try a device that suits you for a few weeks (maybe some you don‚Äôt plan to view ur mother in) and then decide if they helped or not. \\nIf you feel like other symptoms you have are overwhelming the assistance of hearing aids, you are back here. \\nIf they helped you and you had less problems understanding. Congrats. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt really know what to answer to your problems about internal ableism. I either don‚Äôt have or ignored it all my life without knowing. But I love my hearing aids. I love how they look and feel. The ear moulds glow in the dark and they are nice and blue. \\n\\nI hope my first part helped you a bit\\nIt can be really isolating if you don't if you already have had hearing most of your life.\\n\\nI always tell people that you're your own biggest advocate. If your mum is that toxic is it worth keeping a relationship with her when  you can't use something to benefit/enrich your life better?\\n\\nI think some of this needs unpacking with a therapist as well ideally with someone who has a interest in the Deaf/HoH field.\\n\\nI can talk, I can lipread, I can also sign. I still make the world accommodate for me with my hearing aids, not the other way around. I know my rights and know what I need and deserve.\\nI saw my friend get isolated by other 'friends' because she was slow on the uptake for jokes and other conversations. They laughed behind her back that she was always clueless. I always spoke up for her. She didn't realise she had hearing loss and when we looked back after she got hearing aids we realised the reasons she was always one step behind the conversation was hearing loss. It can be isolating.\\nWhen I started getting hearing loss I read up about it that untreated hearing loss is a dementia risk too. So for my health and in solidarity with my friend I embraced HAs and I decorate mine and talk about wearing them as much as I can to help remove the stigma\\nThe good news is that you can choose to wear your hearing aids when you want to‚Ä¶. Or not. \\n\\nIf you have the resources I recommend that you get them and then experiment with wearing them when and where you feel comfortable and you‚Äôll figure it out. \\n\\nDon‚Äôt let anyone tell you when to wear them or why. You make the choice.\\nI have an auditory processing disorder. I wear hearing aids. I know sign language. \\n\\nBefore I got my hearing aids, when I get a cold, I start to ‚Äúhear better‚Äù because there is less background noise. With the auditory processing you were likely working hard to hear, loosing the hearing might mean that your brain has to work less on filtering and more on filling in the missing holes. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt wear my hearing aids all day, but I do wear them when I leave the house and then I may take them off when I arrive at my destination (rare), or leave them on. \\n\\nYou can always do a free trial and see if you like them. All you‚Äôve done is collect data.\"},\n",

I was actually just talking to him about that. He hates his parents and doesn\\'t trust them with his issues, and quite frankly, I wouldn\\'t either, they aren\\'t the most supportive. When I asked him why he wouldn\\'t go to counseling, he told me that it\\'s because \"he doesn\\'t need to get better; They either drug the shit out of you, or send you to the loon box\". Having been sent to the \"loon box\" myself, I told him counselors can\\'t prescribe medication or put you in a place unless they have reason to believe you may be a danger to yourself or others, something in which he is not. \\n\\nHe also told me that he doesn\\'t want to change because he\\'s \"rationalized\" his problems, and that it\\'s \"not fun so why would I want to do it\". His rationalizations seem to contradict themselves every few sentences, and fundamentally he doesn\\'t see that his problems are genuinely a danger to his well-being, quite literally physically with his heart rate issues. \\n\\nAnother thing about the girl and him, I\\'m not saying they aren\\'t deserving of love, but she\\'s definitely not the type you\\'d want to date. Like I said she has a very long list of mental problems, and there\\'s usually an episode with her every week or so, it can include extreme emotional episodes or dangerous suicidal urges, and that is just not healthy for someone to be in a relationship with, I and several other of my friends have been in that situation, and it was unhealthy for both sides involved every time. \\n\\n\\nI\\'m probably jumping to conclusions too quick, but im terrified to see how this might affect him given how he\\'s taken situations like this previously rather poorly. \\n\\nIt\\'s tearing me apart inside right now because I feel like I\\'m being too much of a nag and that I might not be doing the right thing, or that I\\'m doing it in the wrong way and doing the wrong things.

Some species take our genetics home with them, some are attempting to augment the nature of our species here on earth. \\n\\nTo be fair I believe we are a dead-end species on our current path, though without the millenia upon millenia of manipulation from the shadows by dark forces I do not think we would be standing on the precipice as we do now. \\n\\nHumanity is naturally a spirit full of love that lives a rich experience when it knows the oneness of the universe, and our current state is truly a sad one. We have become addicted to the  right of conquest. If only we all knew how liberating it is to dispose of materialism. And for those who would mock the idea (and it\\'s not about getting rid of all possessions that\\'s just dumb, it\\'s about not letting the state of our possessions or the total sum of them guide our happiness whatsoever. \\n\\nThe things I have need to be kept clean and functional those two things matter to me but otherwise there\\'s no extra love. I do love some tools okay I\\'ll admit it some tools have created so much for me that I can\\'t help but enjoy the item. But truly everything in this reality is shit anyways, from the most advanced supercar to the nicest graphics card to the shovel I spent 100 bucks on that I was told would never break. All will turn into a worthless piece of shit, and sooner than you think. \\n\\nIt would be best to take us all back in time and avoid manipulation entirely (not possible whatsoever to my knowledge) but we\\'ve become so addicted to our ways. I don\\'t Believe humanity in its current state would even choose that, we fail to view existence through the correct lens. Logically everybody who continues to carry the torch of violence has to go but with the density shift that\\'s taken care of for us (for others reading my comment that is to say that once Earth rises in density the people who refuse to rise with it will no longer reincarnate here. If you aren\\'t enlightened by the time it happens ultimately this will be your last tour on earth).\\n\\n My question is this- do you think it\\'s wrong for the NHI to augment our species as a whole here on earth?\\n I do often wonder if humanity could be a little less violent and a little less castle-mentality aligned. Our original makers gave us many gifts however we are ultimately an extrapolation of a chimpanzee and well we all know that perhaps their behavior isn\\'t always the most admirable or to be emulated. The only constant is change I think we could and probably should embrace that a little more.'},\n",

I know that eating disorders are not easy to overcome, but it is possible.\\n\\nIt might be helpful to understand that for a large portion of ED sufferers weight actually has little to do about it. Caring about weight is more a symptom of the ED while the root cause is very often a feeling of lack of control over one's own life. That very well may apply to you as well. People often think either that they need control over something and weight is something easy to control or that they have no control and there's no way they can stop themselves from just doing whatever feels good. In either case the ED does lead to having less control over their own life since they spiral.\\n\\nRegaining control is all about teaching yourself that whatever is keeping you from doing the things you want to are bogus. Like, someone with anorexia or bulimia might worry that eating normal-sized meals will make them gain a huge amount of weight. By continually eating normal-sized meals they might notice a bit of uncomfortable bloat for a few hours afterward, but then it goes away as their body processes the food and it's no longer taking up so much space inside of them. They might also notice that when they step on the scale their weight might not change so drastically over time. I do believe that it is important to slowly work up to such things though. If you go from hardly eating to eating a lot more than usual it will shock your systems and can cause additional issues to arise.\\n\\nYou might also find mindfulness to be helpful. Try looking up DBT. It's a type of therapy which utilizes mindfulness meditation as part of its process. Mindfulness can help you get to the root of your problems. When you understand why you feel the way that you do at the core of your problems it becomes easier to figure out how to solve your problems. If you do some introspection and find out where all of this anxiety comes from that will make it easier to fix it.\\n\\nOnline resources:\\n\\n* [High quality workbooks and guides on disordered eating, provided for free by the Australian health service](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Disordered-Eating)\\n* [Eating disorders - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eating-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20353603)\\n* [Self-Help for Treating Your Eating Disorder (overview)](https://www.verywellmind.com/can-self-help-help-my-eating-disorder-1138362)\\n* [Recovery from eathing problems](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/eating-problems/recovery-self-care/)\\n* [5 Strategies for Managing Eating Disorder Thoughts](https://www.verywellmind.com/strategies-for-managing-eating-disorder-thoughts-4019116)\\n\\nHighest rated books that help with eating disorders:\\n\\n* [8 Keys to Recovery from an Eating Disorder: Effective Strategies from Therapeutic Practice and Personal Experience](https://www.amazon.com/Keys-Recovery-Eating-Disorder-Therapeutic/dp/0393706958) (4.6 star, 200+ ratings)\\n* [8 Keys to Recovery from an Eating Disorder Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Recovery-Eating-Disorder-Workbook-Mental/dp/0393711285) (4.7 star, 100+ ratings)\\n* [Inner Harvest: Daily Meditations for Recovery from Eating Disorders](https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Harvest-Meditations-Disorders-Meditation/dp/0894866117) (4.6 star, 60+ ratings)\\n* [Life Without Ed: How One Woman Declared Independence from Her Eating Disorder and How You Can Too](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Without-Ed-Declared-Independence/dp/0071422986) (4.6 star, 500+ ratings)\\n\\nBest Youtube videos:\\n\\n* [How do I tell if I have an eating disorder?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjfR5w4dPEU) (50K+ views)\\n* [Eating disorder signs and symptoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7gYfUF2bQ) (140K+ views)\\n* [5 TIPS to RECOVER from an EATING DISORDER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjIgkMIJW2A) (90K+ views - Kati Morton)\\n\\nEating disorder support groups:\\n\\n* [Virtual support group](https://eatingdisorderfoundation.org/get-help/support-groups)\\n* [US support groups](https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/recovery/support-groups)\\n\\nFree support options:\\n\\n* /r/KindVoice will match you up with a volunteer that will listen to you.\\n* [7 Cups of Tea](https://www.7cups.com/) has both a free trained volunteer service as well as $150 monthly licensed therapist option\\n* If you are in a crisis and want free help from a live, trained Crisis Counselor, text HOME to [741741](https://www.crisistextline.org/texting-in)\\n\\nIf you need to talk more with other ED sufferers you should check out r/EDAnonymous. The name derives from programs for issues like alcoholism. There are groups (which you have probably heard of) with names like Alcoholics Anonymous which offer community-oriented support by and for people struggling with the relevant issues. This subreddit has the same idea. Nobody is shamed for not getting better, but nobody is encouraged to get worse either. Recovery is celebrated. You can even just vent about how you feel open and honestly and mods won't delete your posts because that's what the group is there for. They also have a Discord server, but the server is a bit more lax since nobody is afraid of Discord shutting it down for being a little too real.\\nThank you for replying. Can I ask why you say don‚Äôt?\\nWow. Thank you so much for an incredibly thoughtful and articulate response. I will absolutely read these articles and find the ones I feel will best help my sister and niece in their situation. \\n\\nLike I said I have struggled with disordered eating, but it‚Äôs more mental than anything now. I‚Äôm not overly restrictive, balance is everything to me. I even had fast food for dinner last night, which was a scary thing to even consider for a long time. I still get guilt and anxiety regarding my eating and weight, but it doesn‚Äôt impact me nearly as much as it once did. \\n\\nThat being said, I think it‚Äôs so difficult to try to help a young child with this as my experiences started in my teens, and in an effort to help her heal, I‚Äôm scared I could have the opposite effect or say the wrong things. I will be reading more to refresh my mind and try to be of help.\\n\\nI won‚Äôt reach out over text, but next time I see my sister, likely in the next week, I will bring this concern to her. It hurts me to see this child filling a void with food. Thank you.\\nShe‚Äôs not going to listen to you and will probably in spite cut you off from them. Obesity is something she can see day in day out and she still does nothing.\"},\n",

Male teachers have an easier time dealing with parents. Parents are less likely to melt down, scream at, curse at, or harass male teachers than female ones. \\n\\n2. When a girl has a crush on a male teacher, everyone thinks it\\'s funny or cute and the male might feel a little worried that someone will think he\\'s up to no good. When a boy has a crush on me, I feel trapped and intimidated. They will often be pushy and invade my personal space and basically stalk me and be in my room all the time when it\\'s not appropriate (like before school, pretending to have questions or need help, but it\\'s bs). If I try to firmly reject them, they get angry and yell at me or try to get me in trouble with the principal by saying I\\'m mean or that I hate them. This doesn\\'t happen when girl students have a crush on male teachers. \\n\\n3. Other staff and parents have frequently made passes at me or shared inappropriate stories with me about sex. I am expected to brush this off and not be \"sensitive.\" I feel vulnerable alone in my classroom because male staff will come and block me in (stand in the doorway) to \"chat\" and waste my time, but I feel I must be nice to avoid them getting angry with me. Dads will hit on me when we are alone in my room, and I don\\'t know what to do because I am expected to meet with parents in my room, not in a common space. When I tell other women I am uncomfortable and say what male staff has said and done to me, they say those men are just lonely and not to worry about it.\\n\\n4. I am not given the proper time or space to handle my period concerns or bathroom needs. I must wear a super flow tampon WITH a large pad to make it until my one prep period and then again until the final bell. I get frequent utis due to having to hold my bladder for that long as well.

       "  'comments': \"I can vouch for this, at least via Rover. We have a medium sized house with a large fenced yard in a smallish city. Maybe we just found the perfect market, but the demand seems to be bottomless. We've made $12-15 grand a year the past three years and it could be more if my wife would charge market rate (she's too nice). Sometimes it can feel like a second job if we overbook, but for the most part it's pretty passive income (aside from the poop duty, which is... voluminous). It's absolutely worth trying out if you like dogs.\\nJust a comment on the save for tax day tip. You should actually do estimated payments if you are making any appreciable money doing this. Saving money for tax day isn‚Äôt always gonna cut it for everyone.\\nNo shit! I want to go out of town soon, but it cost an arm and a leg for someone to stop by for 30 min a day and make sure my Miss kitty is ok! :/\\nI do Rover & love it. Great side income & don‚Äôt have to leave my house.\\nAs someone who ran a dog boarding business before Rover was a thing, yes it can be decentish money. We started ours in 2009 and ran it until we changed locations in 2017. My wife and I were doing approx. 400k in revenue on the business, supporting 6 additional dog walkers on 1099s. We sold the business w/ client list when we moved. I just wanted to add a little perspective.\\n\\nIn my current city, GOOD LUCK making ANY money on rover. There are literally 100000000000 dog boarders and walkers with high ratings and bottom-feeding pricing. It would take me a long time to rebuild the business here. We have opted for other ways to make money. I am glad you have found success there!\\n\\nOne point I vehmently disagree with, and that is purchasing crates and using them. If the dog uses a crate at their home, they should bring that with. If they don't they should not be crated at your house. People choose in-home boarding to avoid a kennel experience. If you crate them based on your opinion and not theirs, that is a good solid way to get negative feedback and loss of a client.\\n\\nLastly, if you are boarding dogs AND working a full time job, this becomes dicey if you start to scale. My wife ran the boarding business out of the home and it WAS her job, so she was present with the animals. If you are scaling and watching, oh lets say, 7 dogs at any given time, you cannot just leave the home. I personally would not use you (no offense) if you were going to work all day and leaving my dog in a crate. He doesn't use a crate at home and the whole reason we choose in-home boarding (and still do to this day) is him being around people and socializing. If we wanted a kennel, we would use a kennel. I am not talking NOT leaving the home at all, I am just saying an 8 hour shift style work.\\n\\nWith all that said, this list does contain great hints on how to do this, so I wish you well in your journey. It is a super rewarding gig.\"},\n",

I deserve to be built up, not broken down. The more I look back at everything, the more I realize how horrible he really was, and now I was spared when he broke up with me. Knowing now who he truly is, I can move forward without regrets. I tried my best and all the issues lie with him. \\n\\nI'm also moving next week!

       "  'comments': 'I‚Äôm just going to float a controversial opinion here:\\n\\nThe reason women are struggling with dating so much is because men have not progressed at the same rate as us. Think about it: for generations, we‚Äôve had to marry to just ‚Äúget by‚Äù in life. It wasn‚Äôt so long ago that we couldn‚Äôt work, vote, choose our life etc etc. Even in our parents and grandparents generations the norm was to quickly marry out of high school and start popping out kids - sure there are outliers who chose to also have a career or travel but they‚Äôre far less common than they are now. Throughout all of this, we‚Äôve had to be the emotional caretaker of our relationships - remember this, it‚Äôs important. It‚Äôs our ‚Äújob‚Äù to ‚Äútake care‚Äù of the man and the house and our well-being and appearance. \\n\\nCut to present: really over the last two generations we‚Äôve seen a complete shift in the way women are choosing to live. More of us than ever are choosing a childfree life, choosing a career, choosing to travel. We can have all those things now without being ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù. Women have had to build strength and independence rapidly to adapt and enjoy all these freedoms we can now have without judgement. But we still have the emotional and mental strength of earlier generations imparted in us. Essentially what that means is we now have several generations of women who are mentally and emotionally strong, smart, driven, independent, and able to make their own choices in life. \\n\\nOn the flip side, men have been sort of blindsided with this development and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear to me that they don‚Äôt know how/are unable to adapt to this new generation of women. The overwhelming majority of men still have ingrained patriarchal views, lack of emotional intelligence (because they‚Äôve been raised to expect a woman to take care of them), a hugely problematic tendency to sexualise and objectify us, and an overall total lack of ability to relate to and celebrate the monumental shift women have been able to achieve in recent generations. I think many quietly hate that we no longer ‚Äúneed‚Äù them. \\n\\n*I do have to make the obligatory ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù statement as there are plenty out there who love the fact that it‚Äôs a new world for us and we are considerably less oppressed. I also have to include ‚Äúnot all women‚Äù as sadly there are so many countries/cultures where we are still denied freedom and basic rights. I‚Äôm generalising here*\\n\\nOverall, I find it rare to meet men where there are not issues with boundaries, consent, objectification, and the expectation of emotional caretaking. \\n\\nI can only hope that in time, men finally start to understand that the old ways of relating to women are not acceptable anymore. When they fully embrace a more equal mindset towards relationships then I believe we will have an easier time in dating.\\nAre you are me üòÇ 34 and have not had any type of relationship last for more than a few months over the past 4.5 years. It feels like one big cosmic joke sometimes. I have my sh*t together financially, physically and my mental health is pretty great recently. \\n\\nEveryday I‚Äôm actively working on bettering myself in some way. I‚Äôve done online dating but quit at the start of this year and have been focusing on real life meetups. I‚Äôm at the gym five days week. I taught myself to cook good, healthy food. I spend time with my friends and family. I‚Äôve joined a meetup group. I‚Äôve taken up more hobbies. I‚Äôve said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to social gatherings I‚Äôd usually blow off etc. the list goes on. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt get interest from guys but the ones who do show interest seemingly have heaps of issues they need to sort out (mental health, financial stuff, kids with exes). \\n\\nIt almost feels like the more I work on myself/improve my life the more glaringly obvious it is that so many haven‚Äôt done that same work. It‚Äôs exhausting. I know nobody‚Äôs perfect but wow do some people choose not to work on bettering themselves. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt have any advice other than I FEEL YOU. Tbh I think a lot of dating and finding that one person is pure luck and circumstance.\\nI read this on the happy and single subreddit, but someone said \"dating is not a reward.\" And it\\'s SO true.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLike truly you can max out every aspect of your life, and there won\\'t be some golden man waiting there as a trophy for you. People find their partners at many random points in their lives. Broken unhealthy people can find relationships. I used to think like you and I would beat myself up over what I was \"doing wrong\". But sometimes the answer is literally - nothing. Luck and timing attributes to 99% of the process. Just keep on enjoying your life in the mean time!\\nMy theory is that with each life improvement you make, you are setting yourself up for disappointment when you meet a person who has not taken the steps to actually improve their lives.  I have definitely been on the receiving end of interested people and dates, but I would turn them around because they were not the right person.  Is it bad luck or are you just more selective?  And do you really want to lower your standards?\\nSounds like you live somewhere that you\\'re not a good fit for.

       "  'comments': 'Very well written and digestible - The Atlantic should publish you instead.\\nTried to DM you, but god damn this is one of the best posts, no one of the best written things I\\'ve read in a long, long time.\\n[deleted]\\nAn interesting post, and I would agree with many of the conclusions you\\'ve come to. Personally, I\\'ve never been a fan of the commonly given advice that we just need to learn to love ourselves and to be happy alone. It\\'s not necessarily wrong advice, yes we should try to find happiness whenever we can, but the fact is that there is simply nothing that can truly provide a substitute for a relationship, no matter what we try.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s wrong to say that for most of us here, finding a relationship would be a genuinely transformative experience. Having that close connection with someone, being able to share emotional and physical intimacy, and being able to share our lives with that person would massively improve our confidence, self-esteem and general emotional state. Most of us probably have past experiences of being socially rejected, being picked last for social groups and generally feeling like we never fitted in socially. To be able to have someone actively choose to share those experiences with us and specifically us, when they could have so many other options, would be the greatest compliment possible. It wouldn\\'t fix all of our problems, but would help an awful lot.\\n\\nIt\\'s quite common for people to say that meeting their partner was the best thing that ever happened to them and that they wouldn\\'t know how to live without that person. This is seen as a lovely, romantic thing to say. However for those of us who are alone, it\\'s instead seen as wrong for us to admit that finding a relationship would improve our lives and we are told that we should find happiness in isolation instead. I don\\'t believe that is truly possible. have you ever met someone who was single for their entire life not by their own choice and was actually genuinely happy? I haven\\'t, because we aren\\'t meant to live like this.\\nI think you\\'re conflating something different from this article and trying to relate it to yourself.\\n\\nThe article has a paywall in my case, but from what I\\'ve read, it\\'s not geared to forever alone users. I think it\\'s geared towards the type of individuals that may have issues with codependency and defining themselves based on whether they are in a relationship or not. \\n\\nAs for some of your analysis, I think the most powerful thing to realize about social media, which includes reddit, is that none of it is free. Your attention is how you pay. \\n\\nWhat gets the most attention? Negativity, misery, and ultimately, creating an echo chamber where everyone around you thinks just like you. That\\'s why I don\\'t pay too much attention to the random posts where it\\'s an entire gender hating another. It becomes an issue when people read that and think, \"Eureka! They all do hate me!\"\\nI\\'ve seen it with those pill podcasts using it to justify hating and taking advantage of the opposite sex and I\\'ve seen people use it to justify a latent fear. \\n\\nOne thing about humans is that we are constantly evolving and changing. Dating apps might have been popular before, but people change and realize that approach isn\\'t best. That doesn\\'t mean dating is over. It means that people have taken other avenues. I was just listening to the Intelligence Report a few days ago, and they highlighted the rise of in person matching services. That\\'s one example of the new ways that are growing in popularity. \\n\\nhttps://fortune.com/well/article/elite-matchmaker-navigate-dating-world/'},\n",

A game can be \\'not feminist\\' due to situations outside of the game\\'s control (such as having a sexist dev or CEO), but to be considered \\'feminist\\' it has to exclusively deal with what OP considers to be \\'feminist topics\\'. That\\'s double standards. Also, I don\\'t think something is or isn\\'t feminist purely based on whether it handles topics of womanhood very specifically. \\n\\nWhat about female creations, or in Hades\\' case, art specifically drawn by women, in a story where LGBTQ+ themes are strong and respectful. By this logic, a show like Arcane cannot be feminist because the studio that made it or the community that plays the game is full of degenerates. I also think deciding that Bayonetta is decidedly not feminist, when its main character is a strong and independent woman with her own agency, motivations and sexual expression, but papers please be neutral is...a take for sure. This links back into my earlier point too. If Bayonetta cannot be feminist because according to you she\\'s been designed with the \\'male gaze\\' in mind, then why is Hades not feminist for having been designed by women to be sexy for a more feminine audience? What are we supposing feminism means here?\\nThat\\'s a LOT of work y\\'all have done and I\\'m surprised you didn\\'t run out of space! \\n\\nHowever I would consider embedding the list of games as an image.

If Bloodborne is, I assume the management isn\\'t an issue. \\n\\nIt has a bunch of female characters who are as powerful as male characters, central to story lines, and gender neutral outfits that don\\'t change much by body type for player characters. I was so happy with the game and the ability to wear full coverage armour. You can wear clothes collected from beings of any gender.\\n\\nThere are a lot of female characters, Melina, Roderika, Latenna, Ranni, Malenia, Marika, Cleanrot knights, Blackknife assassins, Millicent, Nepheli, Fia, Hyetta, Irina, the crones etc. plus even more with the extra content now. I\\'d say at least 50/50 representation. \\n\\nAll the characters have distinct motivations, and abilities, as well as styles of dress, there\\'s even disability representation. Multiple characters with prosthesis for example, and characters who are blind but still independent. It plays into the world building, but like Malenia\\'s prosthesis are really detailed, effort was clearly put into design. I don\\'t think they\\'re stereotypical since some are \"villains\", and others are not. They exist on a spectrum of identities.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t a traditional romancing aspect to the game, but female characters can choose the Ranni ending which involves sort of being her partner. Characters gender doesn\\'t explicitly change anything in the story. \\n\\nThere are a lot of themes that tie into social issues. Complex political situations, wars, family, racism. It\\'s just in a fantasy setting, but you can see commonalities with real world issues like the Holocaust, and general themes of discrimination. \\n\\nIt\\'s a very good game, and I found the community was good too.\\n\\nEdit to add: \\n\\nYou have the option to help stop a man who is perpetrating harm against women and men in the game.

I feel for it at first too but when looking back I found a pattern.\\n\\nThe thing is the slippery slope is real and the left has mastered it. They start off with small things that everyone can agree on that have an emotional appeal. Once it becomes mainstream accepted they start the process of using it as a wedge to divide the political opponents from those they want to control. They do it slowly with things that make sense and have emotional appeal. Then they ramp up making opponents into something truly evil overtime while holding themselves up as the saviors and hero\\'s. While they are doing that they add in little things that people don\\'t always agree with but the small steps make people not question it because they don\\'t want to be part of the evil side. Eventually, they push it so far people are agreeing with and pushing for things they would never agree with:\\n\\nExamples - Clinton on abortion: safe, legal, and, rare. The majority agree in extremely rare cases (rape, incest, life of mother) it should be accepted and that it should be as safe as possible. Safe, legal, and rare became safe, legal, and limited. The right raised flags saying they are moving the goal posts, the left says they are trying to force rape victims to carry babies. Then safe, legal, and limited became safe, legal, and choice. The left started removing the limitation to abortion and again the right raised flags. The right was alienated as hands maid tale and those that started to question it was now anti-choice. Now it\\'s safe and a right... creating laws to allow for abortion up to birth and some on the left even arguing post birth and if you don\\'t agree you are after women\\'s bodies and fascists.\\n\\nYou can do the same with climate change, the alphabet mafia, free speech, and illegal immigration. It\\'s a tried and true technic that takes decades to enact but have tricked many into believing they are the morally good, which allows them to commit acts just years previously they would find horrendous. The worst part is they use your own sense of right and wrong to do it with via emotional manipulation.\\nTheir proposed climate change policies are abysmal too.

(This is hard, but in the end will help you realize that you don‚Äôt need a lot of products and will help prevent you from relapsing, trust me I‚Äôve been there) out of sight out of mind \\n- you can rotate products each month (maybe a month can have a theme or something) \\n- it‚Äôs kind of like shopping your collection. At the end of each month you‚Äôll be able to go back to your collection and choose new products for the next month. \\n\\n3. Finally, I understand how difficult it is to get rid of products. I find that when I‚Äôm decluttering I want to keep everything because I consider it all special. You can take away that specialness by simplifying the product:\\n- it‚Äôs a blush. You most likely have another product that looks and works the same. You don‚Äôt need multiple of one product. In fact most blushes end up looking the same, there‚Äôs only so much our skin and undertones can do\\n- as for eyeshadow, ask yourself what colors you actually like and which ones are you forcing yourself to like. \\n- In general, if you have even the slightest doubt of a product, get rid of it! You should only keep what you love and makes you happy! Imagine you‚Äôre going to marry that product lol! Don‚Äôt have doubts! \\n- I find it easier to donate products to family and friends. It sits easier with me knowing that it‚Äôs going to a good place and can make someone else happy instead of just going to the trash. \\n- I think Sephora has a somewhat lenient return policy. Maybe you could return some of the unused products?\\n\\nPlease please don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. You are human and deserve to have peace in your life. ü§ç\\nI think you are on the right path, don't be too hard on yourself. Makeup is something you love, don't make it stressful by worrying about the size of your collection. It's great that you've recognised the issue, now you can work on it. But be gentle with yourself and don't beat yourself up about it. You can change your attitude now and work on your mental health, but don't be so harsh.\\nI think that if you aren‚Äôt ready to commit to downsizing, that‚Äôs okay! But something I would say is that it might be better for you to try and get away from the mindset of ‚ÄúWell this caught my eye for a reason.‚Äù You know the reason. You were coping with a difficult period of your life by trying to get a dopamine hit from shopping. Now, maybe there are some things you genuinely were into and that you would want to use, but I know from my own experiences treating shopping in a very similar way, a lot of the things that I was drawn to, I wanted because I envisioned a version of me who owned that product and felt differently than I felt in my own reality. \\n\\nInstead of trying to decide if you‚Äôre going to get rid of a ton of stuff or try to test it all out, for now, maybe just try to use stuff that appeals to you when it appeals to you. Maybe pick out a handful of products from each category- some that you have tried and like and some that are new, and box up the rest. Shop your collection and rotate things out when you feel bored or you feel the impulse to shop. Maybe twice a year go through the unused stuff and decide if there are any things you‚Äôre absolutely not going to use and then go through the stuff you‚Äôve tried out and decide if there are things that need another try or if you would be better off without.\\nA lot of us relate fully to this, including myself. Before my first massive declutter last year where I threw out literally 2 medium sized cardboard boxes full of my expired 2015-2018 makeup, my collection was similar to yours. I think a lot of factors contribute to it - one major one being influencers calling it a makeup ‚Äúcollection‚Äù. The way that term is now used by the beauty community makes it look exciting and normal for makeup lovers to own drawers and drawers of products. You start feeling compelled to take advantage of every big sale. You feel fomo if you don‚Äôt own whatever viral thing every other girl is obsessed with at the moment. Curating the ‚Äúcollection‚Äù becomes the real hobby. It usually take a few years until we start seeing it in a different light - overconsumption of hundreds of tiny products that will take motivation and time weekly to apply, organize and sanitize until empty, broken or expired. \\n\\nAs a former Sephora employee who had a massive collection after working there, a big way I downsize my backup stash of unopened product without feeling guilty is filling the unused cosmetic bags I accumulated (from brand events or as free gifts with purchase) with a whole face routine of full sized products to give as gifts for family and friends for holidays and birthdays. Like a full size mascara, eyeliner, loose powder, blush, bronzer, highlighter, eyeshadow or palette, and a lipstick. My SIL and mom especially love it and it makes me feel so good to know the products are being enjoyed by my loved ones instead of rotting for years in a spare drawer until I get around to opening them. That‚Äôs totally an option though and don‚Äôt feel guilty if you want to keep and enjoy most of your products for you. Every piece we own is special to us for some reason so only give away the things you like but you know you can live without.\"},\n",

Until age 27 I had to either beg my parents for rides or use horrifically unreliable disability paratransit. And since paratransit completely books up within seconds due to how much demand there is for it I was mostly begging my parents. Everyone made it clear they did not think I was a real adult despite my having a Masters degree and being able to take care of myself in every other aspect of life.\\n\\nThen the inevitable happened. My dad developed neurological problems and lost his ability to drive. My mom simply did not have time in the day to chauffeur both of us while also filling her own needs. I was forced to move to a walkable urban neighborhood with usable transit. My parents spent most of their lives believing that even setting foot in my current neighborhood would lead to you getting shot and killed. But at this point, we realized we had no choice. Thankfully my parents now realize they were being prejudiced, but I still need to fight tooth and nail for my city bus system to keep the funding it needs to remain operational. Because in a year or two, my mom‚Äôs eyesight will have declined to the point that she can‚Äôt drive anymore either.\\nThis is what makes the \"somebody think of the disabled!\" \\'argument\\' from carbrains so infuriating.\\nI don\\'t disagree with you. But the people who want to completely eliminate cars and make everyone take public transportation are also ableists. For example, my anxiety and panic disorder make it so I can\\'t take public transportation without thinking I\\'m going to have a heart attack. So, there has to be a happy medium between these two options.\\nSo just because a small minority can‚Äôt drive, (a lot of disabled people can drive too) it means we have to restructure our whole society so non-disabled people have to depend on uncomfortable and unreliable public transport, making journeys longer for them simply because they live in a society that has to march to the beat of the slowest drum?\\nExactly!'},\n",

Amazing how Yozo was able to process all these things in his head but, unfortunately, was never able to fully materialize what he wanted to achieve in life.\\n\\nThroughout the story, Yozo was constantly reflecting, analyzing, and trying to make sense of his emotions, experiences, and the world around him. But despite all this, he wasn\\'t able to turn his thoughts into productive actions for personal growth, which led him to his continued downfall and sense of despair. This was the most frustrating part of the story for me. I find myself thinking, \"Had he only done this, it would have turned out well for him.\"\\n\\nAnd yet, I also understand how it was difficult it must have been for him, having endured so much internal conflict and alienation from society.

       "  'comments': 'I don\\'t have an answer for you, but I certainly appreciated hearing your thoughts about one of my favorite written and portrayed characters in TV.\\nI think textbook pessimism as a lived philosophy is kinda of fundamentally inhuman, and very hard to hold onto without becoming a hermit\\nI can only respond in the vein of realism because the show really is a masterclass in that.\\n\\nTLDR: The guy needed to get help (some form of grief therapy) when his daughter died. He needed some form of trauma therapy (not just a stay at a psychiatrist facility for a few months) after he was done working YEARS undercover in insane circumstances. He had a substance problem that he was NOT succeeding to regulate (as was Marty), and had an insomnia problem that he sought to treat by purchasing street drugs from a hooker - NOT going to a doctor for help (I mean why the fuck would anyone do that). And he never got ANY help for his hallucinations? All of that and not mentioning his childhood (raised in remote circumstances to a survivalist kook in Alaska without access to television or his mother?).\\n\\nLook at these things this way, and frankly I\\'d be with Gilbough and Papania. Dude\\'s a great suspect, especially when you see him getting hammered in the middle of the day (pilot script and treatment originally having this be a ruse to pretend to be impaired mentally) and admits he doesn\\'t sleep and hallucinates. I mean jfc, guy\\'s a wreck.\\n\\nLonger version: neglected in childhood, faces the loss of his daughter and his wife, gets no counseling, takes out his rage at work (working the local drug circuit to death til they were in hotel rooms busting people for very small amounts of cocaine, then murders a junkie on the job), then becomes a wild undercover agent for years in high-stress and drug-fueled environments before becoming a detective at the start of E1.\\n\\nSomeone with that background needs so much help that the last time I watched TDS1 (my favorite \"filmed thing\" EVER) I had to actually shelve it when I was done -- to face that many things and just try to champ them all without any professional help and then wear a gun on your hip ever day is insanely negligent. I realized how much I really idolized the character for the machismo.\\n\\nHis philosophies kept him isolated, and his contempt for other people only serves to cast himself as better and/or smarter (conscious or not) of whoever he\\'s talking about. He\\'s ironically more self-righteous than others, though he never says it, deflecting by saying things like \"everyone is no one\" - kind of a massive difference from saying something healthy like \"I\\'m not better than anyone - everyone is equal.\"\\n\\nThe show is great, but Rust became a hell of a lot less likable to me as I got older. On the other side of that, yeah I kinda get annoyed with the tough guy attitude.\\n\\nSo, middlepath? Fuck yeah. If he would\\'ve gotten help with like 1 or 2 of those things he wouldn\\'t be the same level of edgelord and wouldn\\'t have had the same difficulty keeping a job, making friends, currying favor, and possibly pursuing the central case with more legitimacy. But this isn\\'t just a show about the case - it\\'s a show about the 2 guys and their lives, and the case, too.\\n\\n(sorry for deflecting all the philosophies - I just think most of all that stuff was bullshit fodder to meet his own ends of staying on his own)\\n\\nEDIT: I forgot to mention at the top that he fuckin hallucinates because of all the drugs and stress he endured, lmao\\nMy personal take is that pessimism is a cold and miserable philosophy and, in a traumatic near-death situation like Rust faced in the end, he desperately needed some kind of human warmth, even if it is bullshit. Basically almost dying broke down all his coping mechanisms and all the walls he had built around himself and forced him to connect with humanity because deep down we\\'re all terrified of being alone. It\\'s like the \"no atheists in a foxhole\" type thing, not that god is real but humans actually terrified for their lives are gonna grab anything comforting they can.\\nHe was abandoned and neglected by his parents and had his daughter torn away from him and his marriage disintegrate. His boo-sucks-to-life philosophy is a means of protecting himself. He needs to accept his daughter\\'s death was a bad thing, and to grieve it.\\n\\nPhilosophically, he needs to get with some sort of Pragmatism and stop chasing the Absolutist ether, and to reject his default to negativity.\\n\\n\"Come down off the cross, we can use the wood\" - Tom Waits.\\n\\nWhat he really needs is what we all need - to work and to love. By \\'work\\' I don\\'t mean emplyment, I mean to feel useful. \\n\\nI think the shift at the end is because he accepts he was loved by his daughter and his father. He couldn\\'t hold his defenses, and he accepted what he knew - what had driven him to reject life.\\n\\nThe final shot is of Rust finally, literally leaning on someone - Marty.\\nThe middle ground is ‚Äúcuriosity.‚Äù \\n\\nThe universe is absent of meaning. But as a member of our species, we need meaning to survive. Similar to how any living organism needs to find sustenance to survive, human beings NEED meaning. It is fundamental to our individual and collective survival. \\n\\nNow, that meaning can come from a cultural blueprint (like religion) or it can be established by the individual search. \\n\\nThis ‚Äúsearch‚Äù for meaning is curiosity. It takes intellectual humility to recognize how little we know of the universe (only the ignorant live in certainty). But in that lack of certainty lives hope. And with hope, comes the search.'},\n",

Like, what does ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt present as autistic‚Äù mean in that context? What hallmarks of their internal experience differ from autism?

Like you said, assuming these professionals specialise in and up to date with autism, then  I expect they can *still* can spot the subtle signs. Heck, throughout my entire life, *people always saw my symptoms*, but just never linked it to autism.

The tables are covered by umbrellas, shields against the eternal drizzle that covers the city. My lunch is so routine, the server doesn‚Äôt even ask my order anymore. I sit down and look out on the traffic and passers-by. Chelsea drops by with my tea not long after, and I smile gratefully at her before resuming my people-watching. Suits and skirts, children in overalls and shorts and rompers, busses and cars and motorbikes all drift past the stationary shops and houses.\\n\\nAcross the street sits a man, his hair sits as a woollen mass atop his tanned, wrinkled head. His beard hangs down in a sheet of steel wool, bushy and thick. Black glasses sit atop his tomato-shaped nose, and he sits and listens to all those who pass.\\n\\nDay after day, he sits beneath the eaves, next to the dumpsters that never seem to house trash. Sometimes he sings, a low and growling sound, and the alley echoes back his shanties and cowboy hymns. Mostly he just sits, unseeing eyes staring through opaque shades, and waits.\\n\\nInvariably, as I finish my sandwich and start on the desert parfait, a gentleman in a suit too rich for this middle-class street comes along. The exchanges are always respectful, their opening ‚ÄúHey there, Old-timer,‚Äù always brings a smile to his face. He calls them by name, pats their back, and tells them of all kinds of things.\\n\\n‚ÄúBig sale at Sally‚Äôs salon on Third today, be sure to drop by and get a haircut. You‚Äôre gonna need it.‚Äù He tells one of the men, and sure enough the next day I see him walking down the road, talking with another gorgeously tanned man in a suit.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an awfully warm day today. Be sure to drop by Jerry‚Äôs florist shop on Beech, and bring a tall drink.‚Äù The next day, it was reported that a fire had broken out next to the shop. The meth lab next door was burnt to cinders, but the flowers were left untouched thanks to a fire truck that happened to be nearby.\\n\\nI finished my parfait and left a fresh bill on the table‚Äî exact change with a 30% tip, the same as every other day, and moved across the street to sit next to the old man. I murmured in greeting, and he nodded at me in acknowledgement. Sure enough, a rich man soon walked by and mentioned greeted the old man.\\n\\n‚ÄúHeya, Sal. You met this girl? I think you should. Show her to the theatre after work, there‚Äôs a show on she‚Äôll love, and you‚Äôll know why that matters about the second act.‚Äù He nodded my way, and Sal quietly bowed and offered me his hand. I smiled at my grandfather, the man who listened to the whole town at once, and he grinned back in his knowing way.\\n\\nSal was wonderful company, and the play was as charming as ever. My favourite part came up, Elizabeth read Mr. Darcy‚Äôs letter, and I could feel my face light up with the squeal it always brings me. I looked his way, beaming, and Sal‚Äôs eyes widened.

It just has a good balance to my ear, and I don't have to worry about switching and installing voices on any i device I use. Some natural voices don't sound too well to me at the high rates I've built up a tolerance for over the years--a kind of distracting choppiness--and a slow responsiveness of the commands to the speech stream is completely maddening. They had it right in what they wanted back then.\\n\\nOne thing that can be an issue is that a non-natural speech synthesizer is disturbing to sighted people when you use it on a device in public, and they can't understand what it says.\\nwow, this is pretty cool.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy journey with TTS is a long one, but I'm now at the stage where reading fiction with Eloquence generates character voices in my head. I reread Robert Heinlein's Space Cadet last night and, the parts of the story in training where they were in spacesuits sounded different, in my head, as though I were hearing the characters speaking over earpieces and headsets. My reread took an hour 40, the audiobook is about 7 and a half hours. Now obviously that's a huge difference, but I've been using eloquence for nearly as long as I've been using Windows.\\r\\nI also binged thousands of pages of Harry Potter fanfiction in the years between books 4 and 5, content unavailable in any audio form. My use of audiobooks had already long been on the decline, but that nailed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nReading aside, I find using Eloquence as my daily driver efficient and reliable. I don't want a Human in my ear, I want the data from the screen in as an effective form as possible, not a Human interpretation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born blind in the 1980's. I was lucky enough to be given a Talking Language Master during the last few years of my primary schooling, then access to a BBC PC and eventually DOS then early windows after that. I probably began using Windows full-time when I was introduced to JAWS with version 3.2, although I'd be using it like a shell with a hardware synthesizer and a British screen reader called Hal before then on and off. I still found DOS more useful for most things back then.\\nI like the in between. I don't do well with espeak, but love eloquence or vocalizer. If something like 11labs was my screen reader voice, I would not be able to listen and use my devices either. They are just to human and expressive.\\nI lost my vision in 2014, so didn't grow up with the robotic voices, though did play with all the Mac novelty voices in MacOS 8 and 9 to read back stuff I typed. I strongly prefer normal and realistic voices since they are easier on my ears and much easier for me to parse. I stay far away from all Eloquence-style voices and get irritated when I have to listen to them. The rough robotic voice sounds just pull my attention away from whatever I'm trying to do or comprehend, and I picked up screen readers much more quickly when using them with the natural voices.\\nMy wife used the DEC Talk PC  for many years but had to give it up due to OS changes. Used DEC Talk PC USB for a while, then JAWS. Alzheimer's means no more PC usage, though.\\n\\nWife used to listen at 2-3-4 times speeded up. She was a judicial officer.

Your mum could be experiencing neurodivergence too. Have you spoken to her about it? \\n\\nI think I remember a post a while back on the ADHDwomen Reddit where someone asked the group how many of them had a narcissistic parent, and there was quite a high response. \\n\\nI have also read Janette McCurdy‚Äôs ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Glad My Mom Died‚Äô - which was brilliant, and a little bit like you - it really resonated with me and my own upbringing!

If any of you have answers for OP let me know because I feel like my kids have written this from the future.\\nIt's hard to separate trauma symptoms from autism because society as is stands provides no options for raising an autistic child without traumatizing them. \\n\\nThat said a lot of the signs you see in your mom are trauma symptoms including oversharing, shame, and lack of a social network. \\n\\nThe loudness and inability to shut her mouth could be ADHD. The low threshold for injustice and change could be autism. However there's much here that may be pure trauma. \\n\\nBeing physically beat by your entire immediate family and never allowing yourself space to recover or have other loving relationships messes with one's brain as much or more than natural neurodivergence.\\nI know we‚Äôre not supposed to diagnose others or ourselves, but ever since I started doing more reading about neurodivergence and understanding what the symptoms look like, I kind of suspect my whole family has something going on. I definitely see it in my own mother (although she is a lot different from your description of your mother). \\n\\nAnd I honestly kind of think you can easily start to see these patterns in your own family members, and it‚Äôs kind of justified to see it in your parents since it‚Äôs known to to run in families, especially if you have been formally diagnosed yourself. And we now know how it is much more common in women than previously thought. \\n\\nI think it sounds like she has some complex issues though. Like she definitely had a traumatic upbringing but also it sounds like she is definitely autistic. \\n\\nSome of your descriptions sound exactly like my sister. My sister has recently been diagnosed with ADHD- hyperactive and she also believes she is autistic. It makes sense to me because:\\n- she also has the motor-mouth thing going on\\n- she definitely tends to over share and talk about stuff that you shouldn‚Äôt about in public, and she gets defensive if I tell her we‚Äôre not supposed to talk about those things in public. It seems like she has a hard time understanding social contexts\\n- she also has poor spatial awareness and coordination and stomps and slams doors without meaning to, and I don‚Äôt believe this is stimming by the way, as well as dropping things frequently (I also have this issue minus the stomping and slamming doors though)\\n- she also has difficulty with changes (when she was a little kid she would have meltdowns, and I think I did too; they called them temper tantrums back then)\\n- she‚Äôs also super smart (and can come across arrogant at times), I think being told how smart she was as a kid didn‚Äôt help\\n- she‚Äôs also highly anxious (I think it‚Äôs basically a defense mechanism that develops due to repeatedly having getting in trouble for saying or doing the wrong things, and I have this too but to a lesser degree), \\n- she also has the sensory issues with clothes\\n- she also was bullied as a child. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt know if all of these things you listed count as aspects of autism or adhd, like I‚Äôm not sure that being confused about your sexuality is related? I think part of it must be cultural. A lot of older patriarchal cultures have made women feel ashamed for their sexualities and the only way to be a sexual person was if you were trying to get pregnant. \\n\\nI think the shame and self-criticism is an aspect of depression. Honestly, it sounds like she has severe untreated anxiety and depression, and maybe it is partially because of her being different her whole life and the trauma that can cause a person. And it could be related to her religious upbringing or just the way she was treated by her parents, or all of the above. \\n\\nNow I don‚Äôt know how productive it is to give her this label if she isn‚Äôt seeking it herself. But I feel like it can definitely help you understand your own upbringing and relationship with her by viewing it through a different lens.\"},\n",

I don\\'t ever want you to feel like you need to be my therapist.\" I had a full-body reaction to the idea that my mom would ever have the self-awareness that she had turned me into her caretaker. \\n\\nIt\\'s been a slow process of disentangling myself from that enmeshment, but geographical distance (living far away), therapy, and education has really helped. Recently I\\'ve been really impacted by the book \"Discovering Your Inner Mother\" which deals with the concept of the mother wound and re-parenting yourself. It also talks about the way the family system often demands a parentified child stays the way they are, as caretaker, family secretary, and mediator, and resists the child\\'s attempts to change. \\n\\nI think what you\\'re feeling is grief! It makes a lot of sense. I don\\'t think the grief ever fully goes away, but as things start to shift in your life, I really believe you can find more peace and that the heaviness will start to lift.\\nDamn your situation sounds a lot like mine. I see how much love you have for your family. I understand what it‚Äôs like to be the eldest and ‚Äúfirst to complete‚Äù those benchmarks. Now when younger siblings struggle, we are the ones they turn to. \\n\\nI also understand the fear of an enmeshed family ruining your relationship or hope of love. Your partner understands you and loves you. They will not leave you for seeing you cope and manage this unfortunate situation. Your life is for you to live. I believe you making this post is an acknowledgement of that, and I‚Äôm proud of you.\\nI\\'m really sorry. It\\'s very overwhelming to carry so much responsibility before we are ready to do it. It\\'s encouraging to me that you have already redirected things in order to care for yourself, taking a different job and role in your career. How you sound in what you write reminds me of the many grief cycles I\\'ve gone through over the years. Usually during life transitions of some kind; like maturing, next stages of relationships, the age of my kids, stages of education, stages of jobs and career, my health. It was like all the stress and worry would get heavier, and that feeling of crying. But from way down deep and unspecified. I learned it was grieving (denial, anger, bargaining, sadness, acceptance). And those moments were the stage of grieving where you need to cry. I also learned that I needed to do a better job of prioritizing myself as much as I cared for others. I didn\\'t need to care for others less, although that happened as I learned about boundaries, but I did need to care for myself in equal measure. One for one ratio.\\n\\nEducation (like therapy) helped tremendously. Understanding what was going on in my internal world, gaining language to describe and talk about it, learning tools for coping and feeling more in control of my existence all has led to stability and peace. There\\'s still plenty of moments where I struggle, but not remotely to the depth that you speak of. So things do get better. Also, meds. Those are a God send for giving you some stability and peace while you learn how to create that for yourself but haven\\'t quite gotten there yet. Five stars. Haha\\n\\nHang in there.

Your boss showed a serious lack of professionalism and ethics in lying to you about a job interview. I‚Äôd start looking for a job elsewhere and include on your resume that you led shifts. Your manager clearly has no problem lying to you, so you can assume any offers of promotion won‚Äôt materialize. How can she take credit for your work when you are getting the credit?

Ask for any help from such organization, your goal should be to find a mediator to talk on your behalf to your parents. Trying to make them understand what you are going through. It'd be challenging to support yourself with education if you leave your parents. So take measured step. If you really want to break free of them, then you have to be financially independent. Try to learn some skill, like, design, web site development, wordpress development, wix site building, SEO, marketing etc. Try to get some work from upwork, fiverr etc. then you can support yourself & study\\nThis is very unfortunate and quite common in Bangladesh. I have seen something like that in my own family. My relative is now in serious mental distress. She is now getting help from physiatrist and lots of medication and yet to get better. I really don‚Äôt understand why parents in Bangladesh like that. It‚Äôs also not safe at all for lone girls in the country. See if your parents will allow you to abroad to study? If so that will be your best option. Really don‚Äôt know how can anyone help you? If anyone try to help they might get in trouble from your parents.\\nSince you're 19 now, is there any way you can have your own NID made? You can open bkash account with your NID.\\nFirst of all I think you should contact some specific women helpline in bangladesh (I don't know if they are still on after what happened in bangladesh). Polive will not do anything rather they can make your situation worse. You will not find any good advice in reddit because most bangladeshi don't use this app. Create a new Gmail account that is just yours and post many anonymous (if you want to be anonymous) post in Facebook groups that is based on helping each other. You can also post in groups that are related with domestic violence. Fleeing your home would end badly given the current situation in bangladesh where no kidnapping case is being picked by the police and media.

I just know that the old me is gone. I've tried getting back to her, but she no longer exists. It's hard to accept, but we're capable of healing and growing into better, stronger people.

I enjoyed studying in college and was good in my classes. I returned to college this year, and now I'm failing. I‚Äôve never failed a course before.

If your professors don\\'t have rules naman regarding eating in class, sobrang laking tulong nito especially if you have back to back classes na during lunch time talaga. \\n\\n‚Ä¢Just like you don\\'t need new makeup or shoes, you also probably don\\'t need pens and highlighters in every color of the rainbow. They will all dry out before you can even use them.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Befriend your classmates. Yes I know madami satin introverted (I am one) but this is so helpful especially in cases na hindi ka na talaga makakapasok dahil sa sakit or emergency. Kailangan mo ng matatanungan ng assignments or kung may upcoming quizzes ba. Although always be mindful din. Magandang may madedependehan pero wag laging dumedepende. \\n\\n‚Ä¢ Utilize your university libraries!! Utilize the library within your locality kung meron!! Wag puro cafe. Wag puro study hubs. When you have enough time between classes but not enough time to go back sa dorm or bahay, you can nap or even sleep at the library. And no one will judge you!! Not even the librarians. Bonus yung mahahydrate ka pa kasi afaik most university libraries don\\'t allow any food or drink inside aside from water. \\n\\n‚Ä¢ If you\\'re not from the area you\\'re studying in, make sure you have every emergency landline/ mobile number there is. Hari nawa walang mangyaring masama but you\\'ll never know.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Your powerpoint slides don\\'t need essays on them. A phrase, a word, or a picture is enough. This is why most students end up just reading the slides rather than presenting kasi nasa slide na lahat ng gusto nilang sabihin.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ If for example walang wala ka na talagang time magbasa ng assigned readings, try and go to class early and sit with your classmates na nagdidiscuss nung readings. As a social sciences student noon, di talaga maiiwasan yung may materials ka nang hindi mababasa. What I did was I sat next to or near my classmates who have discussions before the class, kahit hindi ko kaclose. Para bang nakikichismis lang. It saved me so many times especially sa mga prof na ang hilig magpasurprise quiz.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Google Docs and Microsoft Word have built in citation features. A lot of students forget or simply don\\'t know that they do have this feature where you just fill in the necessary info and with one click of a button, you\\'ll have a reference list na. Will save you a lot of time especially if hindi mo gamay yung citation na required by your prof.\\nGet a passport while you\\'re still a student. You can use a student ID iirc. Then National ID since you\\'ll probably get it in 2 years more or less. You will have 2 valid IDs by the time you graduate which are helpful for work.\\n\\nAlso, if banks such as BPI, Metrobank, BDO, and etc visit your school and offers free registration, grab the opportunity and register for an account.\\n\\nIf possible, apply to companies before graduation if you want to get a job asap. In my case, I started sending applications around Jan - Feb when my graduation was around June then did interviews around April - May. You can say that you are about to graduate. Just make sure you don\\'t fail in any subjects at makakagraduate ka talaga.\\n\\nLastly, I suggest investing on a good formal outfit that you can use for presentations, defense, intervews, etc. I recommend a black blazer since its what is usually used in research defense and profs will judge based on your outfits as well. Madalas ito nakakalimutan and you don\\'t want to buy this last minute since formal outfits can get pricy.\\n- Do voluntary internships. Di mo na magiging problema \\'yung \"fresh grad with 3 years experience\" (for the most part). Gives you an edge compared to others in the job market, makes your CV look good, tapos kumikita ka pa. Don\\'t do unpaid ones because they\\'re never worth it unless super laking company or dream company mo. Kahit hindi ka business or econ major, you can absolutely do this.\\n\\n\\n- Join orgs. Org experience gets you internships, and internships get you job offers. Make sure the org position is worth it. If your university has an org with a good network, join that one.\\n\\n\\n- Network. Make connections with your schoolmates. They are going to be professionals in the future, so are you. College is not just about the degree, but also the network.\\n\\n\\n- Learn a new language. Multilingual people get paid very well.\\n\\n\\n- Upskill. May free time ka? Do online courses na may certification. Pwede mo ilagay sa CV mo \\'yan.\\n\\n\\n- Create a LinkedIn account!!! I interned in the HR dept of a company in BGC last year, and part ng screening namin ay \\'yung pagcheck ng Linkedin. I think good impression if may LinkedIn presence ka kasi it shows na you at least know how the corpo world works. Also, pad your CV.

I felt so thankful that I will never have to live or visit India. Indian women deserve so much better. I am so sorry. Your government is failing you. Your men are failing you. We all know if she were a man exposing corruption she would've just been murdered, not tortured and raped before being murdered.\\nThis is so upsetting to me.

He was trying to convince me it was Indian men not women who were oppressed in their country. Because the men are ‚Äúverbally abused‚Äù, ‚Äúfalsely imprisoned for rape‚Äù, ‚Äúfinancially abused‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse reporting of rape and abuse is high‚Äù because women ‚Äúuse it as a weapon‚Äù. It was a very disquieting and unnerving experience. He would not leave me alone either. Took it to DM‚Äôs when I told him to leave me alone (conversation was going nowhere). \\n\\nThis was just one man from your country. One example. Then hearing things like this happening, and thinking about how you live in a country with men filled with that kind of I‚Äôm justified in being abusive because I‚Äôm the actual victim (how dare a woman speak up, right?) kind of mentality. I fear for the women in your country so much.\\n\\nIt also seems like you are in the midst of great change in your country regarding women‚Äôs rights. I fear some of the men are only going to get worse because they feel threatened. I am praying for all the women in your country right now.\\n\\nEdit: for anyone interested here is the thread it is kind of a unique insight into the mindset of what seems to be a lot of the men in India and how they seem to have a vicitm mentality. How they sweep under the rug womens issues because men are so oppresed in that country apparently. Forgive how b***** I was in the thread.

I don‚Äôt know what to do to help but to leave my thoughts here and hope my comment starts a larger discussion. Women everywhere are connected unfortunately by the violence we all experience regardless of country or creed. This case is especially vile and my heart hurts for this woman‚Äôs pain and the pain of all women in that area dealing with the aftermath. As well as her family and loved ones. Women deserve to be safe and not hunted like prey by our fellow man. Change needs to happen not just in India but worldwide.\"},\n",

My test results came back normal and I‚Äôm told to just take supplements and quit using cannabis, the only thing I really have for my pain. It feels like a nightmare, it feels like no one on this planet understands, except you guys here of course. It‚Äôs so frustrating. I recently quit university because of how bad my health got. I don‚Äôt even have the faith that my doctor will sign my medical leave form since they think I‚Äôm so young & normal. I don‚Äôt even recognize myself anymore, the name chronic pain doesn‚Äôt even give justice to how painful this is\\nMe too. It‚Äôs so frustrating not knowing what‚Äôs causing the pain and symptoms. I‚Äôm praying for all of us who are dealing with pain, anxiety and depression üíô\\nDon\\'t give up. It took me 11 yrs to get diagnosed and I was diagnosed almost by accident. I\\'ve had been in a the hospital for a few days again. Dr came and said... you are just constipated because of the use of morphine. I got so extremely angry. Telling him he could not be more wrong.\\nI used morphine Because I had extreme abdominal pain, not the other way around.\\nThen I screamed And IF I was constipated WHAT THE HELL is that pain in my BACK!?\\nDR looked at me confused. Your Back you say? ME: Does anybody listen at all?? I keep telling you people that it starts in my back and ends in the front. DR: Can you show me? \\nMe showing him. He looks at me and said I\\'ll call neurology. Neurology  took 1!!! Look at my symptoms. Looks at me and says \\n\"I think I know what is wrong\" Total disbelieve on my end. But he was right. Only reason he knew was that his study buddy did research on my condition. That is why he instantly recognised it. \\nAnd I\\'ve had so many surgeries tests etc that I started to believe it was in my head and I was thinking to myself I was a munchhauser. But then again I hated going to the Doctors and hospital. I did not need attention, I needed an answer. \\nJust keep advocating for yourself. It sucks when they don\\'t take you seriously. \\nI\\'ve experienced this so many times. They were way more willing to help if my Husband would intervene. Even if I said the exact same thing he did. They rarely listen to a woman I noticed unfortunately.\\nLiterally you 100% sound like me.

I\\'ve had neck pain and spent way too much time on the internet in my younger days practicing terrible posture. Once, for a few days, I felt like I was just constantly wanting to fall backwards and I wasn\\'t sure if there was some major neurological issue or what. I workout these days and work on posture so I\\'m much better and haven\\'t had that issue since. So as far as dizziness and vertigo go, it could well be due to bad posture.\\n\\nI have bad anxiety too and when I do my front core tightens which makes me want to slump. The way I\\'ve handled it is, even if I\\'m going to be anxious, I mentally re-route that tension to more relevant muscles needed for posture. I use a stool now so I can\\'t totally relax when sitting anyway which makes me not sit too long, which is again something I need to do.\\nSeems like my story. And i figured out that it\\'s all related to posture you are on the right path and actually indeed anxiety, brain fog, tiredness it\\'s all related to posture. Ribcage position and hip mobility.... all boils down to Posture. But correcting it is a hell of a lot of work and patience. You need to find kinesiologist or movement patterns expert. Specially trained in Bill Hartmann model.  You can start focusing on videos from greg Chaplin, Zac cupples, Bill Hartmann. It\\'s 100 percent correctable'},\n",

I noticed that‚Äôs after switching to a dumbphone the only things that need internet on a smartphone phone are not THAT important, i always remind to myself ¬´\\xa0if social media or any internet based apps are so important then how were we living in the late 2000‚Äôs ? we just lived that‚Äôs it !\\xa0¬ª\\nDuring that time i had a a Sony Ericsson W995 that i used only for music on my way to school and to call my parents to reassure them that i arrived at school safely or if i had an emergency.\\nI took the bus everyday to go to school and for the bus schedule i just used the paper version, it‚Äôs as simple as that, and i survived lol.\\n\\nIn 2024, it feels that we need a smartphone for everything since everything get more and more digital but actually there‚Äôs no law that force ourself to get a smartphone or a phone at all, how the elderly or some disabled people do then ? Or what if your phone battery dies ? There should always be a non digital version for any task (ex : i hate qr codes menus at restaurants, is that more complicated to print out menus ? As said previously what if your battery dies or your camera is broken, you don‚Äôt eat ?).\\n\\nFor my experience after switching to a dumbphone lifestyle i noticed that i accept more to be bored or waiting to get at home at the end of the day to check youtube/reddit or to talk with my friends, waiting for this moment makes you appreciate it more ! It‚Äôs as exciting as waiting for a day out with your friends, you notice the precious value of the moments !\\nYou\\'ve worded exactly this growing desire I\\'ve been having... I resonated with every sentiment of yours, with \"Clockwork Oranging myself\" and \"being force-fed the seven deadly sins\" hitting close to home, because that\\'s exactly what I feel has worsened my experience of technology, not to speak of my overall cognitive performance (which should be alarming in and of itself!). Being born in 2001 I\\'m lucky enough to remember a very few years before algorithmically tailored, short-form content where using devices was exciting, as you said preparing media for yourself to enjoy in doses in the upcoming days rather than shoving down anything, instantly, shocking the brain over and over again to squeeze out some cheap pleasure. Reading this post has reminded me of all this. I\\'m determined to strip my cellphone of all the \"cheap pleasures\", I\\'m curious and excited to see how it will go :)\\nThanks OP, your post resonates so much with me. I\\'ve only just started looking at this sub and I\\'m keen yet hesitant to make the switch. Crazy how much I view my smartphone as something of a lifeline, which on reflection is perhaps a good enough reason itself to make the switch!  \\nMy anxious brain keeps going \"yeah but what if x, y, or z happens and you\\'re stuck somewhere without a smartphone!?\" as if I\\'ve had one my whole life and cannot breathe without one. It\\'s crazy how much it has a hold on me. Which is how it feels. It has started to feel suffocating, or maybe just too much like a comforter.\\n\\nI was relative latecomer to smartphones and have only had one for about 10 years, but in that time my concentration span has steadily gotten worse, my sleep has gotten worse, I haven\\'t read as many books as in the 10 years before that, etc. I am in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD (actually more ADD) and I think the smartphone just doesn\\'t fit at all well with such neurodiversity conditions. The usage patterns, distraction and dopamine disruption, etc.  \\nI have come to realise that I\\'m addicted to my smartphone, to doomscrolling, to online shopping, to social media to some extent (I use WhatsApp and Facebook but can and do avoid them at times), er... Reddit!  \\nI have tried limiting it\\'s use recently - leaving it at home a couple of times when going out for a walk, not leaving it on my bed side table at night so that I don\\'t look at it during the night (which is perhaps the habit I loathe the most right now), etc, but these haven\\'t stuck, as, well, like I said I\\'m addicted and it\\'s not easy to give up or control because that\\'s the nature of addiction. So I think I need to cut the cord as keeping the smartphone to use with wifi just means that I\\'ll continue to do that all the time and just use the dumb phone for making calls and texting, and I\\'ll end up walking around with and managing two phones which is more even more ridiculous than the situation I\\'m in now!\\n\\nAnyway not sure why I\\'m putting this here. Felt appropriate rather than making my own post. I guess I just cannot fathom how one has the discipline to keep their smartphone but not continue to use it 24/7 whether it has a SIM card in or not. The lack of a simcard would only slightly curb my use and to be honest after some time - maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks, maybe longer (although likely not) - I would miss it (i.e. the dopamine cycle) so much and rationalise any excuse (which is how addiction works) to simply put the sim back in the smartphone and guiltily ditch the dumbphone. Hmm, don\\'t think this is going to be easy for me!\\n\\nThanks again for sharing though OP!'},\n",

My understanding and experience are below: \\n\\nIt is short-term counseling (usually up to 5 hour-long sessions after the intake session). When you call, after some logistical questions and verification, a licensed counselor will answer the phone and does an intake session with you to understand what brings you to counseling (generally 30min-1hr). After the intake session, they let you know if they recommend the further counseling sessions for you to work through the issue. (I haven't had them not offer the additional counseling sessions). They can be telephone sessions, video sessions, sometime in-person sessions. Telephone sessions they can generally schedule you pretty quick for the sessions, generally less quick for the video and generally much less quick for the in-person. If after the sessions you want to continue, they're happy to work with you to keep that counselor or find additional counseling, it just wouldn't be covered through the EAP.\"},\n",

       "  'comments': 'My dear mentor, who was an ICU Consultant, would often tell me: \"There\\'s already a long line of people waiting to call this person an asshole. Don\\'t get in that line. Get in the other line, much shorter, of people who have a professional obligation to look after them.\"\\n\\nI deal with my feelings by acknowledging them and setting them aside; it\\'s only relevant to their care insofar as it\\'s a significant source of bias. Plenty of coronial inquests are about unsavoury people who, no matter their unsavouriness, didn\\'t deserve to die.\\n\\nYou used a great word, countertransference, and perhaps this is a good time to reflect on why their behaviour provokes such strong feelings in you. How would your parents have delt with you if you behaved like this?\\nPsych Reg here to add my two cents.\\n\\n\\nThe most important and difficult thing about counter-transference is recognizing that you\\'re experiencing it. So kudos on you for reflecting on that!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s important to recognize counter-transference, firstly because it is associated with burnout and therefore it is important to recognize and manage it before it leads to your work being affected. A debrief with a trusted colleague or even a non-work friend (can be a very casual debrief) can go a long way in dealing with counter transference and avoiding it\\'s negative impact. One trick that my supervisor taught me was doing a mindless or a mundane task after a particularly difficult work day can help reset some of the countertransfer (I do this by either putting on a sitcom that I enjoy and have watched many times before or scrolling on my phone).\\n\\n\\nSecondly, it\\'s important to recognize counter-transference because you\\'re not obligated to like everyone you treat but you are obligated to treat everyone to the best of your abilities and negative counter-transference can lead to sub-consciously providing sub-standard care to that pt. So it is important to recognize that you\\'re experiencing negative countertransfer from a pt and making sure you\\'re still treating them the same way you would treat any other pt.\\n\\n\\nLastly, knowing the underlying cause of the pts\\' behavior can go a long way in developing empathy towards them and managing countertransfer. The example you gave of the pt who takes no responsibility and puts everything on others. That is very commonly seen in pts with cluster B traits and it\\'s called having an \"external locus of control.\" It can stem from having horrible things done to you in the past and your agency being taken away that you start viewing the world as having no control in it. It can also be a maladaptive coping/defense mechanism - your life is so miserable that it is easier and more comforting to blame everyone else for it than to consider that you might have contributed to it yourself or take responsibility that you have a role to play to fix it (which is a lot more daunting thing to confront).\\nI find kicking them out cathartic to be honest. \\n\\nBeing a psych reg is a lot like being a car salesman. You can find enjoyment in being able to convince these people to follow the plan you have outlined. \\n\\nThe PC answer is that these people often have went through significant trauma and a lot of the things they say are clues to pathology underneath. It‚Äôs more enjoyable when you see them as a puzzle to understand rather than someone being a dick\\nPsych Reg here - it is complicated and you have to look beyond the behaviour.\\n\\ncountertransference/transference and projection identification is a very powerful defence mechanism and way of seeking help/getting needs met/pulling people close/attachment seeking behaviour. \\n\\n  \\nprojection identification involves projecting for example their own hatred of self onto the doctor. The doctor then internalises this and projects it back onto the patient. Ultimately fulfilling the patients belief they are a bad person. \\n\\nThis behaviour is unconsciously driven.\\n\\nYou have to consider the vulnerability of this person. And the psychological regression that is entailed in a hospital admission. Behaviour regression, acting out, escalating behaviour to elicit responses. \\n\\nSome people have a background where the only time they were \"held\" by their parents was in restraint. So using aggression is a way to draw near. \\n\\nYou also have to consider re-enactments which are occurring between the patient and yourself.  for example Re-enacting relationships with care-givers (or lack there of) \\n\\nYou also have to consider the power dynamics at play - Mental health act, involuntary treatment. Persons who have a background of trauma are very vulnerable to power dynamics.\\n\\nWhat Im saying is you have to display empathy and reflect on how this person makes you feel. If you feel irritated i bet they feel irritated. IF you hate them I bet they hate themselves.\\nThe points being made by other commenters are absolutely valid: these are symptoms of underlying disorders/unmet needs etc so there is still work to be done on some level.\\n\\nHowever, if you\\'re dealing with an asshole, you can provide all the empathy in the world. You can sympathise with every trauma and disadvantage that life has thrown their way. You can be fully understanding of how they ended up being an asshole.\\n\\nBut they\\'re still an asshole.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t acknowledge that, and acknowledge the response it generates in you and the toll it takes just interacting with some patients, you will end up accruing a whole heap of negative emotions that you won\\'t process until it is too late and you, too, hath become yonder asshole.\\n\\nDo your best. Sometimes, you\\'ll get to see that crystallizing moment where someone actually internalises a change, but you\\'ll miss that opportunity if you\\'re burning all your empathy on every single person that comes through the door.\\n\\nLook after yourself, and look after your team. If you feel this way, the nurses and fresher doctors might be copping it more consistently but trying to appear professional by suppressing all of this until they pop. Coffees, donuts and debriefs (even if it\\'s just a quick \"Christ, how frustrating was that guy yesterday!?\") go a long way to making people feel okay about being meat for the healthcare machine.'},\n",

So, just in case they bring up that argument, remind them that you are not controlling them. They can do what they want. And you can do what you want, such as immediately leaving the conversation.

No issues (so far).\\n* And any **paper** **check** I write (not as common these days, but still once in awhile) is against my Fidelity account. I have written payments of $9k and $15k to contractors in recent months. No issues (so far).\\n* I use the Routing/Account for both **PayPal** and **Venmo**.

Half of what you hear on Reddit is going to be an over exaggeration or half-truth as you‚Äôre only getting one side of the story. In reality though, don‚Äôt be nasty (curse/threaten) when you call a company, don‚Äôt have trading violations (buy more than you can afford, try to game the system unethically), don‚Äôt overdraft your card or write bad checks. Like any financial institution, there are some things Fidelity can‚Äôt control that will negatively affect you- court orders to lock down your account, AML or similar issues being flagged, etc. If you follow the rules that you should have with ANY financial institution, you have a 99% chance of never having an issue. last add- make sure to designate someone on your account that your financial firm can contact if they have concerns of your well being (diminished capacity) and set up your beneficiaries so your heirs can move forward without much trouble when you pass. Oh, and tell someone where your assets are located so they don‚Äôt have to go on a hunt while trying to mourn you.\\nFor larger amounts, a wire transfer, despite its expense, may be the best way to fund an account.\\n\\nACH can be reversed, perhaps even after settlement. Wire transfers cannot, at least without significant human intervention.  Fraud looks like a deposit in, high risk trading, possibly before settlement, and then an unexpected reversal or withdrawal. Fraudsters don't want to use wires as much because there is human intervention on both sides, and it costs money.\\n\\nUltimately a wire transfer can go to gross settlement with FedWire, which is the final system of record for US dollars, transferring between institutions by the Federal Reserve system.\\n\\n>The Fedwire Funds Service is the premier electronic funds-transfer service that banks, businesses and government agencies rely on for mission-critical, same-day transactions. Fedwire Funds Service participants benefit from the finality of payments credited to their Federal Reserve Bank master accounts\\n\\nA whale who is a valuable customer will wire in a large amount and then invest normally.\\n\\nAlso a margin may help protect Fidelity as well as it gives them the right to liquidate securities to meet cash debits.\"},\n",

       "  'comments': 'Wow. Do other regional offices do these type of events? Like in TX?\\nI can 100% agree that if there is any chance you can attend I highly recommend it. I went to the same event wanting to get an update on 2 pending claims. The first claim seemed to be a no brainer, the C&P exam was completed, it seemed like all the docs were there so I thought maybe I could get it rated on the spot. The second claim was for PTSD. I\\'ve been waiting on a C&P exam and my goal for that claim was to get an exam scheduled. When I sat down with a rater we talked about the reason for my visit and we started with the PTSD claim.\\n\\nSide note: Prior to this event I had a C&P exam for insomnia secondary to GERD. Ultimately the examiner opined the insomnia was not connected to GERD but based on the hour and a half exam the examiner determined my PTSD and other MH conditions were caused while in service. So with that information I submitted a secondary claim for PTSD. \\n\\nSo, during the conversation with the rater I told him I had an exam for insomnia and the DBQ should be listed. The rater found the DBQ, read through it and said, \"@#%@%, I can\\'t understand why someone didn\\'t pick this up. I can get this knocked out in about 30 minutes.\" I was, \"let\\'s do this.\" At that point I thought the rater was going to walk me out and work on it a little later but instead the rater took care of everything as I watched. When he finished, he got in a chat with another team who does the QC & approvals and told them he was sending my claim over. The rater got a response from the other team saying I was next. I was impressed. Not wanting to push my luck, I had to ask about the first claim. The rater told me since it was a PACT Act claim it need a deeper look. I accepted that answer and thanked the rater for all of his help. \\n\\nAs I drove home I kind of expected it would take VA a week or so to get everything wrapped up and determine my rating. It was an hour drive from the event to the house. When I got home I checked my overall rating just for shits & grins, I was floored. I went from 90% (86% in total) to 100% (96%). It turns out I was rated 70% for PTSD. Needless to say, I was speechless. I was amazed for the small investment of 5 hours, (driving to and from the event, wait time & discussion with the rater) I managed to get my rating over the top. But it doesn\\'t stop there, about a week later I received the decision letter and was surprised I ended up at 100% P&T.\\n\\nI highly recommend if at all possible, try and go to this event next week. I can\\'t say you\\'ll end up with same rating but at least you\\'ll be able see how sausage is made. It could be well worth your time. Good luck.\\nThanks for that. \\n\\nWill make an effort to attend.\\nNow is there something like this for Georgia?\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj5x6xvxwomd1.jpeg?width=717&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df0ea34ee47dde57ae1f22e649e72c033f291957'},\n",

Because you must receive student finance to be eligible. As an international student you must work to get student finance. If you work you are not eligible for the studietoeslag.\\n\\nSo it's eligible for those students who have a residence permit for asylum or an indefinite residence permit and for students who have a specific residence permit type 1. But not for students who have a residence permit for study.\\n\\nI think it is one of the benefits from public funds that can end your right of residence. It's eligible for those EU-students who receive student finance because they have been living in The Netherlands for five consecutive years or because their parent or partner with EU-nationality work or have been working in the Netherlands.\"},\n",

Mine presents a bit differently to the world, but his thoughts/rational felt so familiar. \\n\\nI‚Äôve also been through a miscarriage and I know first hand how it can screw you up and mess with your perception of others. Learning that Brianna went through that without the support of her then husband made me forgive some of her communication issues. I could not imagine going through that without the love and support of my husband. I think that explained at least some of her trust issues. \\n\\nI wonder if the reason some on this thread have been defensive about it might be that they saw themselves in the parts of the book that you saw as ‚Äúcartoonish‚Äù. As someone who constantly struggles with worrying that they are overreacting to the world and wondering why they can‚Äôt handle certain stimuli as easily as most others seem to do, that was the part of your post that hit me the hardest. Obviously, I‚Äôm sure that wasn‚Äôt your intention, but just providing some potential insight. \\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, I also find her advertisements for her own bakery very silly and unnecessary. They don‚Äôt really take that much away from the book, but they certainly don‚Äôt add anything\\nI loved it so that‚Äôs where one positive review came from ü§∑üèΩ\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è'},\n",
