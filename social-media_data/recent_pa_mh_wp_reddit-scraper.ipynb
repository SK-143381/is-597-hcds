Plus, many times our members put in a lot of emotional and mental labor to answer the questions and offer advice, so it's helpful to keep the source information around so future community members can benefit as well.\\n\\nHere's the original text of the post:\\n\\nHi all! This will be long, my apologies. I'm new to being a hinge and wanted some advice on how to balance myself and two partners along with how to address one of my partners as a hinge in his own relationships. TLDR at the bottom.\\n\\nMe (f25)\\nJohn (m24)\\nPaul (m27)\\nKate (f31)\\nHenry (m31)\\n\\nQuick history on the dynamics for better understanding. Earlier this year I ended my LTR with John and started dating Paul who is polyamorous. I'm insecure but I'm trying my best. The break up did not have to do with Paul. John moved out but ended finding work in our hometown and I allowed him to move back in where we started dating again. Paul and John know I am polyamorous and am dating both of them. Paul and John do not particularly like one another but are being nice for my sake. I'm not forcing them to be in each other's company unless both parties are ok with it. I've made it clear to both of them that they can leave if they are unhappy/uncomfortable. I will not break up with one of them if the other asks, it's not fair to me or the other party, this is also clear information to John and Paul. Paul is also the one who suggested I could be polyamorous with both him and John.\\n\\nHere's where I need advice; how do I balance two partners, my job, and honestly myself? John and Paul both say I'm not giving them enough time, I barely sleep and I feel like I'm drowning. I want them to both know I'm here for them and care for them, but they both have voiced complaints of not enough me time. I live with John so I literally see him about everyday and will forgo sleep to take him out. I see Paul about every other day and will forgo sleep to spend time at his house or go out with him. Paul is afraid I'm going to go back to mono with John and I keep trying to reassure him but it falls on deaf ears.\\n\\nI also need help on how to better communicate that I feel left out on group activities that involve Paul and his girlfriend Kate. I literally have to act like Paul and I aren't dating when the three of us are out. Paul and I won't hold hands, will keep an arms distance between us and try not to talk one on one because Kate will become uncomfortably standoffish. I try to talk to her but she won't speak to me and Paul insists I should go on these outings with them. I get along with Kate's husband Henry just fine, we talk and banter and he treats me like a part of the group. It's awkward and draining and I'm not sure if Paul is not reassuring Kate or what is going on there. I don't know if I should bring this to her directly or to Paul. Kate was initially fine with me but as Paul and I got more serious these cold behaviors towards me began. Also, if I decline going out with them Paul says I'm a flake or not trying and I have to give up some, what should be fun, experiences ie: festivals, concerts, movies. I've tried to tell Paul I feel left out but it feels like he doesn't hear me. Paul will also go out of his way to make time for Kate and expects me to just be available so it feels like I'm sacrificing more of my time and wellbeing to see him and it's causing a bit of jealousy on my end.\\n\\nIt's becoming exhausting. I feel like I can't keep my head above water and that no matter how hard I'm trying someone is unhappy with me. I just want to love and be loved but this is taking a toll on my mental health.\\n\\nTLDR: I'm trying to be a good partner to both my boyfriends but they both feel like it's not enough. One of my boyfriend's girlfriend doesn't like me to the point I don't want to be alone with him and her, and I'm unsure how to discuss this with him.\\n\\nPlease be gentle but constructive, I feel beat up as is but really want to make this work.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's blown up her entire life with this shit, takes no responsibility for her part and alienated her own child. Putting 'Christian' on it doesn't make it not a cult. \\n\\nObviously she can't be committed as she's not literally psychotic, but she's far from psychologically healthy.\\n\\nIf she's being abusive to the husband and daughter then let her scream into the void. Maybe she'll find her way out again, maybe not. It's up to her.\",\n",
       "   \"I'm not convinced this isn't a medical thing. Not to suggest that this marriage is in any way salvageable, but this seems bigger than delving back into a cult. She had to be in a state where a suggestion of cheating with his step-daughter would take footing, which a healthy brain would be able to see for what it is, I believe.\\n\\nI had an illness that affected my mental health massively. Never went this far with it, am still married, thankfully, but it would have been an understandable choice if he had left me. It was auto-brewery syndrome. In the end, I asked for the anti-fungals that 'cured' it, not knowing that it would happen. Just thought I had oral thrush. No doctors looked for auto-brewery syndrome, it was an accidental discovery. After those meds, I had my life back, it happened FAST. It took a month for the adrenaline to wear off. I could see all that I had done as a mom and wife, and I am still processing that guilt. \\n\\nAt my worst my memory was shot. I couldn't transpose more than three digits at a time. I couldn't carry a conversation AND drive safely at the same time. My memories felt drunk, despite no alcohol. My symptoms  list was long, but I largely attributed it all to genetics, lack of sleep, and just being odd. It wasn't until the cloud was lifted that I realized what had happened. When I would talk about everything, people would tell me it was a normal part of being a parent. It was not. \\n\\nPoint being, if something like this is happening, I doubt any doctor would be looking for it. It fucks with you and is invisible. My brain is still recovering. I had only listed to one musical artist for more than a decade. I couldn't stomache anything else, and then a few months ago, it went away. I am enjoying other music! \\n\\nI doubt anybody has the same symptoms if this is the case, it would probably depend on the area of your brain that is getting the most damage. But her going off the deep end like this feels familiar and makes me feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf she starts having other acute medical problems, like seizures, this could very well be what is going on. I believe  mine would have evevtually killed me, and I doubt the doctors would have caught it. I had started to say goodbye to the important people in my life, believing I was going to die, and I couldn't see how messed up that was because it came on so slowly. My brain was fucked, and it turned me into a monster. \\n\\nI think OP should be open to a medical issue. It might not be there, but the crazy he is describing feels familiar.\",\n",

There are so very many elements of this story that point to a psychotic break and I just feel so sorry for this woman that the person who was supposed to know her and care about her the most in the world was happy to just let her go when she started acting weird.

I once sat down because my feet and bad knee were hurting and I needed a moment to catch my breath on a hot day.. she looks at me and says \"(my name) why aren\\'t you working?\"... I explained and she didn\\'t look pleased.  Eventually one day she was a cow to me saying a certain anon volunteer says they caught me constantly on my phone..I wasn\\'t on my phone..only time I was on my phone was during breaks and to make sure it didn\\'t fall out my pocket.. we didn\\'t have lockers..all coats and bags were put in the kitchen..I didn\\'t trust no one... when the anon volunteer told the manager the BS.. she pretty much was horrible to me\\n.but since the BS with the Anon volunteer..I snapped and decided to quit. I didn\\'t mind volunteering till manager was on site.. then after the phone BS stuff I felt so depressed, I felt like I trusted no one and I got sick of being treated poorly...I told myself I didn\\'t deserve this crap and quit.. I didn\\'t have a backbone then... Eventually that charity shop closed and is now an Indian restaurant \\n\\nFew years later I volunteered at my local job centre.. I had to sign people In by paper.. most days were boring..I had the choice of job search for something to do which I did from time to time when the pcs were free and not many people were coming in..my manager there sat next to me with a divider between us.. oh I hated her more than my charity shop manager.. another person targeting me..with how talked to me and the other volunteers was different..she treated me a little poorly too.. one day I was really upset as my grandad had died.. the heartless cow didn\\'t care and wouldn\\'t give me a new bus pass like she said she would because I was 1 or 2 minutes late for work when I try to walk fast as I can .. at that point I wanted to cry.. then this one really peed me and my mum off.. I was suffering from sickness and diarrhoea and I was feeling extremely weak(its rare i get sick).. she heartless cow wanted me to come in to work.. my mother and I agreed for me to not to go in.. few days later when I was better both ends I tried to go to volunteering at the job centre.. I got to the end of my street very weak till I called my mum saying I\\'m coming home..I couldn\\'t cope.. so I went home..manager wasn\\'t pleased..then another day I was feeling a little stronger..

It’s possible that your rep might not be as visible right now, but they’re there to advocate for you and support you in situations like this. If you’re not sure who your rep is, try contacting your local AFSCME office or HR for that information. It’s worth a shot—especially when it comes to things like not having representation during your Performance Enhancement meeting, which should have been available to you if you’d asked. \\n\\nI understand the fear of retaliation, but remember that retaliation is illegal, and your union is there to help ensure your rights are protected. That being said, not every issue can be solved perfectly through the union. Sometimes, resolutions take time, and there aren’t always quick fixes. But you really only have two options:\\n\\n\\t1.\\tDo nothing and hope things change, which probably won’t happen.\\n\\t2.\\tWork through the union, voice your concerns, and at least try to make things better. While the outcome isn’t guaranteed, it’s better than doing nothing and hoping for a change that might never come.\\n\\nEven if the process doesn’t resolve everything immediately, bringing up your issues helps set the stage for addressing them. Plus, you’re not alone—if others have left and faced similar challenges, your voice adds to a larger narrative that the union can address more effectively.\\n\\nMost importantly, your mental health is crucial, and no job should make you feel the way you’re feeling right now. Don’t hesitate to get the help you need, both professionally and within your union, to find a way forward.

It\\'s a private university so I\\'m not quite sure what you\\'d like Marylanders to do with this information.\\nI really get how complicated this situation is, but as I mentioned, r/Maryland has been uniquely dismissive of these concerns. Reading closely, it’s clear that the lack of checks and balances and the inability to appeal grades led many students to be put into probation unfairly, often for sketchy reasons. For instance, a racist professor discriminated against Black students, and the lack of oversight allowed professors to have unchecked power over their students’ academic fates. In Adam’s story, if Christina Harnett had agreed to give him an incomplete like every other professor did, he would’ve graduated. And many of the students in the story were only forced into academic probation after they revealed disabilities and professors began treating them more harshly as a result. \\n\\nThe systemic issues I’m highlighting—like the inability to appeal grades and the lack of accommodations—are critical to understanding why students are struggling. While there may be individual factors at play, that doesn’t negate the need for accountability and reform within the program. Additionally, mental health conditions are ADA-protected, meaning universities have a responsibility to provide appropriate support.\\n\\nThe program is even having trouble hiring new faculty because these stories are well-known within the counseling community. My goal in sharing this is to raise awareness of these issues and foster understanding, encouraging a more constructive conversation about how to improve the situation for current and future students\\n\\nBtw, people were more sympathetic 2 years ago when it first came out, funnily enough: https://archive.ph/wip/QNSDt\\nHere, just from reddit. Otherwise, a lot more convo in the field goes on outside reddit as you can probably guess. I’m connected with quite a few therapists and therapy profs in the state given my background and yes, the program has a toxic rep. Some local sites even no longer work with the program to do internships now. Loyola’s program even reached out to Katie saying they couldn’t believe what happened to her and invited her to apply to their program. Counselors vote with their feet by avoiding working at the program, hence they had to make some adjuncts fi time just to get their numbers to 11 (was 15 in 2019). This summer, [they even posted a desperate hire for an 1-year-term faculty for this school year](https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/37694968/lecturer/#:~:text=The%20Johns%20Hopkins%20University%20School,and%20Clinical%20Mental%20Health%20Counseling.): **it’s almost October and no one filled the position.** Over 15 testimonials submitted to the Office of Civil Rights too just one this one program. \\n\\nhttps://archive.ph/KWjkD\\n\\nhttps://archive.ph/TmcJL\\n\\nRegarding the original post that caused so much backlash here, therapists subreddit was sympathetic and even got reddit gold from it: https://archive.ph/DwgPx\\n\\nThe backlash on r/maryland also did not occur on the Hopkins subreddit. other posters shared struggles in another department: https://archive.ph/wip/5GQXN\\n\\nOne example, you might\\'ve heard of Sheppard Pratt, a pretty big and well known mental health system in the area. They have big issues with JHU Counseling because the program teaches that Dissociative Identity Disorder doesn\\'t exist, and other problematic things. Also, when we first lost our accreditation our Dean rashly sent an email to every supervisor in Maryland saying that JHU would allow students to graduate early then have them finish their internship credits afterwards so they can be grandfathered into CACREP, which is illegal. After this happened, a lot of JHU graduates had more trouble finding jobs for awhile. \\n\\n**A student who managed to graduate sent me this. She, and many others, were also forced onto probation plans. Even JHU\\'s equity office admitted that the program was giving them out inappropriately:** \\n\\n*I am a student with documented disabilities. I had a terrible experience with a professor last year in my first semester. I was working on a group project and there was a lot of confusion in my group about what was expected for the project. I was the only person that was brave enough to ask the professor for clarity. I wanted to advocate for my group because they didn\\'t feel comfortable asking. I then heard from one of my group members that the professor complained about me asking so many questions. Then I got a phone call on a Sunday morning from the professor in which she said “I know you have disabilities, but not all your professors are going to be as understanding as I am”. I was NOT having any problems in any of my other classes or with other professors. Her class was the only class in which this was an issue. When I told her that I was asking these questions on behalf of other students in the class, she didn\\'t believe me and told me that I was the only one that she was getting questions from. I then told my classmates that I refused to ask any more questions of the professor and that they had to ask them themselves.*\\n\\n*When I shared this experience with other people, they told me I should speak to my advisor about it but unfortunately this professor is my advisor. This experience left such a bad taste in my mouth that I no longer trust my advisor. Now I feel like I am often lost in the dark not knowing about important information about the program because I\\'m too scared to ask my advisor.*\\n\\n*I have a lot of deep-seated trauma from the experience I had as a disabled student in public school growing up. I wanted to become a school counselor so that other people didn\\'t have the same experience that I did. But the way that I\\'ve been treated in this program has been retraumatizing and brings back a lot of memories from my childhood. I hate it when people in my life inquire about my grad school experience because I have nothing positive to share. I would never recommend this program to anyone, ever. I have gone into a life time of debt and have to spend the rest of my life paying off my student loans for a program that has mutilated my spirit.*\\n\\n**A second student**\\n\\n*I\\'m not sure if this can help, but I wanted to share something I went through in my internship that seemed extremely unfair. I do not have a disability, but it was enough to put me on blood pressure medication and anxiety medication which seemed counterproductive for a counseling grad student*\\n\\n*I did the program in school counseling. My internship supervisor was Dr. X. When the time came to make my video, I discussed it with my site supervisor and we decided I would use a student with whom I had formed a good relationship and had ongoing sessions. This student had a long history of trauma and often doubted her ability to cope with issues as they arose. Before the video, my site supervisor and I went over the content we would discuss in detail and my site supervisor was very excited about what I had planned. I had the student come in for the video and tell me about her week, then we did an activity where she wrote coping skills on paper tools and put them in a paper toolbox. I showed the video, and Dr. X called me into her office the next day. She proceeded to tell me that my video was one of the most unethical she had ever seen, and if I ever did something like that again, she \"would not hesitate to kick [me] out of the program so fast [my] head would spin.\" I still don\\'t really understand it, but I guess because I led the student in an activity and didn\\'t just let her ramble about soccer for a half hour, I breached some kind of ethical guideline? My site supervisor was furious and both she and her supervisor said that they would defend me against the university if it came to that. I\\'m now in my 4th year as a school counselor and regularly tell kids \"we\\'re not gonna talk about that - either do this project or go back to class.\" If only Dr. X could see me now.....*\\n\\n*I always thought it was ironic that in a program that was supposed to be teaching us to be compassionate and empathetic professionals, most of the professors had no compassion or empathy. I never felt like I could make a mistake - I felt like the gatekeeping meant I had to be perfect 100% of the time. Since moving to another city and working with interns at other programs where growth and mistakes are encouraged, it makes me sad that Hopkins, with such a great reputation, makes their students so neurotic and fearful.*\\n\\n\\n**Across JHU:**\\n\\nDisabled engineering student: https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2022/09/professors-and-deans-can-do-what-they-like-to-disabled-students\\n\\nAdditional undergrads: https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2021/10/students-with-disabilities-report-exclusion-and-discrimination-on-campus\\n\\nAnd disabled students sharing their experiences in Hopkins subreddit: https://archive.ph/wip/WEMAq\\n\\n\\nhttps://archive.ph/wip/pokyL\\n\\n***\\nAnyway, it\\'s valid to question the credibility of students who couldn’t maintain their grades. However, I think it’s important to acknowledge that the issues being raised go beyond individual academic performance. These students weren’t simply struggling with coursework—they were often placed on probation after revealing disabilities or facing other forms of discrimination, which suggests that their academic difficulties were exacerbated by a lack of appropriate support and unfair treatment. Revealing disabilities made things much stricter and less supportive for them (such as Katie being forced to work with COVID positive clients unlike other students, and the unfair treatment subsequently tanking her mental health and performance).\\n\\nAgain, even the students you don\\'t sympathize with were put on a path to struggle and failure that could have been entirely avoided if the program had been less toxic and more supportive. For example, if Christina Harnett had agreed to give Adam an incomplete, like other professors did, he would have graduated instead of being forced into a situation where he ultimately couldn’t succeed.\\n\\nThe systemic problems I’m highlighting—like the inability to appeal grades, lack of accommodations, and unchecked power given to professors—are broader issues that can affect any student, regardless of their academic standing. The reputation JHU is developing in the counseling field reflects these deeper concerns. **It’s telling that they’ve struggled to hire new faculty, and their enrollment has dropped significantly in just one year since these articles became public. My own advisor is gone now.** \\n\\nWhile I understand your experience with nursing, business, and med students didn’t reflect these issues, each department operates differently. The problems in the counseling program may not be as visible in other areas, but that doesn’t negate their existence. I’m sharing these stories to raise awareness because these aren’t isolated incidents—they’re part of a larger pattern that needs addressing'},\n",

I think most likely not happening. Besides physical touch, there’s an emphasis in Arab culture about family, reputation, and success. You must be family oriented (and usually wanting start a family), be a good member amongst your community and come from a “good family”, and you should have either a good paying job or a good degree (in medicine, law, or engineering).\\n\\nAnd let’s not forget mental health. Not something where people are as open about in the Middle East.

It’s about the collective struggle we’re facing as social workers and mental health providers—fighting a system that continues to turn its back on both us and the vulnerable populations we serve. The issue isn’t about individuals trying to play the savior, but rather the lack of systemic support from lawmakers and organizations like MCOs. This is about advocating for the profession, for justice, and for those who rely on us, while acknowledging the pain and frustration of feeling left to fight alone.\\n\\nThe post reflects the deeper commitment we have as social workers, grounded in our core values of social justice and service. It’s about refusing to accept apathy from those in power and continuing to fight for a system that supports both providers and clients. This isn’t an egocentric fight—it’s a collective one, rooted in our ethical obligation to stand up for what’s right, even when it feels like the world isn’t listening.\\nAh, there it is—thinking in singular. That’s exactly the issue. The overwhelming majority of social workers and mental health providers thrive on collective action. Research consistently shows that collaborative care models improve outcomes for clients—studies from the *Journal of Interprofessional Care* and *Social Work in Health Care* make it clear that teamwork is essential in addressing complex needs and improving health outcomes. If we stick with this ‘I’ instead of ‘we’ mentality, it’s no wonder the system is falling apart. Viewing this work through a singular lens only pushes our profession—and the vulnerable populations we serve—into a deeper crisis. We’re already facing a critical shortage of mental health providers, with demand rising and financial strain increasing on individual providers.\\n\\nYou absolutely have the right to your autonomy and perspective, which I respect—but it’s not just me who refuses to sit back and be silent. There’s a growing movement within our profession that rejects the passive, singular approach. Groups of providers across the country—like *The Behavioral Health Provider Alliance* and *The Psychotherapy Action Network*—are joining forces to fight for real reform. These grassroots efforts are tackling critical issues like fair reimbursement rates, reducing provider burnout, and improving access to mental health care for underserved communities. Providers are recognizing that collective action is the only way to bring about the meaningful changes we all need. Maybe it’s time to look through a different lens—because isolation isn’t going to move the needle, but unified action will.'},\n",

And so when a woman sexually assaulted me I did nothing to defend myself. I cowered like he did to my mother\\'s abuse. It took years to reflect on what happened to me and deprogram this idea of never defending yourself against a woman. Against men who attempted, defending myself was second nature, but against a woman I fucking froze and cowered out.

I would have divorced her after gathering enough evidence to support me in court and  take her to court for custody. I know that wouldn\\'t be easy, but I\\'d still go that route.

It\\'s called **\"The Here and Now Habit\" (2016) by Hugh G Byrne PhD** I got it from the library, actually. Finally reading it this time and it\\'s my new current book project! 😁😀🤩\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSupport is certainly helpful and great but Shanny is missing the CRUCIAL link between accountable accountability, responsibility, toughness and structure that such specific ED and mental health programs would offer (as you\\'ve stated). If she could do it all on her own, she would have recovered years ago. But, she can\\'t, doesn\\'t have to, and it won\\'t work nearly as effectively if she just let down her walls and let someone from the professional sphere of things help her out and teach her the skills she needs to replace the unhealthy behaviors. \\n\\nThat would require some insight, a want to change, a desire for a better life and stripping herself from the parasocial, inappropriate and unhealthy relationships she\\'s cultivated for years with her audience. Which is a hefty task. Still possible though. Just makes it all a little less likely to happen--Shanny might see it as having to give up something she thought she was or wished to be and coming to grips with everything she\\'s actually done to people over the years which could be a lot and rather heavy. It\\'s *still* worth it because her life is important and matters, I just wish she\\'d allow herself to see that, exist in that, BE in that and live in that. But alas, I\\'ve gone on the tangents again.... \\n\\nThanks for reading and stopping by, Alison!! Neuroplasticity is always an interesting topic. 💜💜💙💙\\U0001fa75\\U0001fa75🧠🧠🧠\\nNeuroplasticity is the ability for our brains to form new connections in order to function.  They used to think this ended in childhood, but we form new connections throughout our life.  A good example is when you move houses.  You might drive halfway home only to find out you were driving to the old house.  That\\'s Neuroplasticity - you have a hardwired neuro connection that automatically thinks of home as the place you used to live.  Over time, with repeatedly reminding yourself of your new location, the new house becomes home, and becomes the new \"automatic\" home connection you make when commuting back to your house.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how it works with personality deficits after a disruption, but for physical stuff like talking and walking after an accident, it\\'s teaching the person to reconnect the intact brain tissue to circumvent the damaged parts.  More than one area of the brain works to perform all of our functions, and they work together.  So the person might need to relearn speech through their ability to sing, for example.  They might not remember how to speak, but since singing comes from a creative side of the brain, they may remember that function.  So over time their ability to sing will help them tap into their ability to build words into sentences.  Very fascinating.\\n\\nWhen it comes to an undamaged brain creating new connections, it\\'s all about weakening the existing neuro connections by not indulging in them and actively choosing a new response to the same stimuli, every time.  That\\'s why ED treatment can work for bulimia if a person wants it.  At a treatment center they are given calculated meals catered to their needs, already prepared.  They are not given enough for a proper binge.  They are also being monitored on their bathroom use afterwards, and have staff and other patients to help them work through hard feelings.  But with enough time and real effort and desire, a person can and will recover from anything.  \\n\\nNeuroplasticity is also now being used for mental health, EMDR is a great example - trying to neutralize the body\\'s natural response to certain memories or triggers.'},\n",

You might need to stay with family for a while. I really urge you to treat this for what it is, a mental health crisis. Just seeing a therapist is not enough if you are at risk of self harm\\nShe needs to deal with her massive anxiety issues- it must be exhausting to exist in a constant state of panic and stress about things that aren\\'t actually problems. It\\'s also kind of insulting to hear your salaries and know that she is still constantly complaining about money and stressing out- so many people including myself make so much less than her and have actual real things to stress about! But anyway, if she won\\'t deal with this in therapy/ with medication and by taking it seriously, then you should seriously consider leaving. People have to treat their own mental health issues, so there\\'s nothing you can do in this situation.\\nIt sounds like time to have \"the big talk.\"\\n   \\n be open and clear with her.  Not during an \"incident\" but maybe as soon as you come home.  \\n    \\nSit down, and tell her how serious this is.  Write down your main points so you can be sure to hit them.  \\n    \\n1. It\\'s not about any particular incident, it\\'s about the constant stress and high anxiety affecting your mental health every day.   \\n    \\n2. It\\'s making you not enjoy being around her and not want to come home.     \\n    \\n3. Something needs to change or you can\\'t predict what will happen.   What she does is up to her, but the result has to be a big change because the relationship is in trouble.  (Because let\\'s be real, if she goes to therapy religiously but doesn\\'t fix the issue, that\\'s not a solution that works for you)\\n    \\n\\n    \\nIf she tries to make it about a particular thing, try to remind her that it\\'s not about whether any particular incident is valid.   It\\'s about the overall high number of these situations.  She can argue any 1 situation, but she can\\'t argue that she has an unusually high number of them.\\n    \\nYou could also institute a stop gap measure.   Like if the conversation is going well.... ask if you two can agree that you walk away if she\\'s flipping out and not responding well to help.  Then do that- stop making yourself crazy trying to calm her, because you can\\'t fix the issue that way.   She needs to learn to self soothe.  So when you identify it happening \"babe, I love you but I\\'m walking away.\"\\nHave you told your wife how her behaviour is affecting you? What would happen if from now on, every time she puts you down or makes you feel like a tiny idiot, you immediately call her out on it? Use \\'I-statements\\' that describe what it is that she\\'s doing and how it affects you. \"You are raising your voice at me and it makes me feel small, I\\'m not going to continue this conversation if you keep raising your voice\". Be specific, so you don\\'t get to arguing about whether or not she feels she snapped at you. And then follow through! It\\'s clear your wife doesn\\'t treat you well currently - make sure you are taking good care of your own mental health. Part of that, I think, is making sure that you stand up for yourself. She seems to have learned that it is okay for her to treat you like this. If you want to stay with her, she needs to learn how she *should* be treating you, and you\\'re the best person she could be learning that from. Her reaction to you setting boundaries will also tell you a lot about how much she actually values you as a person. \\n\\nGood luck!\\nI was married to my best friend - who also happened to have serious mental health and substance use issues and took a lot out on me. I would have daydream-y thoughts about how nice it would be not to be here anymore, when I was driving I would think maybe I’ll crash - wouldn’t be so bad, and then he was away on a boat and I thought - maybe it’ll sink! That wouldn’t be so bad, would it? And then I realized I was actually at a crisis point. I wasn’t (probably) going to die by suicide (and I certainly wasn’t going to do him in) but life seemed interminably long. We separated, eventually divorced and the daydreams stopped. There was a boatload of therapy involved, as well, don’t want to minimize that. Sometimes you’re so deep into the shit, it becomes your normal. Pay attention to how you feel on your own and give yourself the same care you’d give to someone else you love.\\nShe won\\'t go to therapy because she has you to take it out on. I hope that if you leave her, you take the dog. That\\'s all I can say. \\n\\nNo, that\\'s not all I can say: If you are entertaining suicidal thoughts and have mental health issues, but they go away when she goes away, but both of your focus is always mostly on how SHE feels, I know how to cast my vote.

Okay, the Valley is mostly happening for her.

Maybe she'll teach the new staff how to open wine bottles, or shorten their dresses, or provoke more camera time. She's been the only person to mention the crew, and expressed concern at keeping them employed. As a former crew member, that made me think that perhaps she was friendly to them for 12 years, which as a producer, is a good quality. I think she also hopes Lisa rewards her for her loyalty. \\n\\nI could see if she wants to learn to be a line producer too. The one who does all the laborious work of making calls, arranging vendors, permits etc. it would be the best skill set to gain right now with which to best insure work for the next 20 years.

No other cast mentioned within the body of that statement. Not, I'll miss my friendships. As we've seen with Sheana, when she moves on from boyfriends, she moves on.\\n\\nShe does want to do an HR review of Raquel who she has a beef with, over Jax's health, over the lawsuit against Ariana. I'm not sure she should be talking about Ariana or Raquel. The lawsuit is in motion and is private. It feels like she's auditioning for Ariana's friendship again. Let them work that out in private. I'd rather see her welcome at SAH, than hear about this again. To paraphrase Ariana, if it means something, do it off camera. If the Valley is a new chapter, don't give this chapter air. Since she has her own mental health issues, she's advocating for Jax to address here. I respect that. She walked a huge circle around Brit and Jax. Probably told by the Valley Producers to not reveal anything upcoming.\\n\\nThe Stassi question really made me see the strings behind the questions. She's reminding us that she's good with Stassi, that they are both Moms, that she has an ongoing relationship to Chili's as a sponsor, that she and Brock read in bed, and that she's heard of the New York Times bestseller list. My goodness! In other words her new goal and pitch is to write a best selling book about her Mom friendships from VPR including Stassi first.\\n\\nIn other words, the whole thing felt like a job interview/pitch/PR statement not like a conversation. Very pragmatic. Not saying that's a bad thing, but I didn't used to see her through that lens.\\nI hope Scheana can find a good regimen for her mental health. Hormone impacted depression is so devastating whether it’s PMDD or postpartum. She’s been navigating this since her pregnancy and I can’t even imagine.\\nHer success with mental health will be ours as well.

You\\'re doing a good thing if you report them so don\\'t worry about it.\\nYou don’t ‘press charges’ in the uk. You alert the authorities and they make an educated decision on how to proceed. One of those routes will be to get them the mental health support they need.\\n\\nYou would be doing the correct thing to report them.\\nYes absolutely you should.\\n\\nFirst, if people are in the middle of a crisis, they still need repurcutions for their actions. If only just to push them to solve their issues.\\n\\nBut really, it should be up to the courts to decide their punishment and if this really was down to a mental health issue then they\\'ll be pushed to fix that. The courts may determine they\\'re not safe to others too and may be taken away from people. Because while tragic and terrible it might be for them, the simple matter is they can\\'t go around attacking people and if they\\'re going to do it again they need to be put somewhere where they can be helped but also not be a danger to others.\\n\\nTheir mental health issues won\\'t be of much concern to the friends and family of a fatal attack victim.\\n\\nIf I was going to be a danger to people, I\\'d want to be put in a hospital or wherever. It could even be my own loved ones that I\\'d attack and the last thing I want is to be roaming around a danger to people. I would want to get the help I need and going through the courts is a way of getting that.\\nYes because its the right thing to do, and may mean that the person can access forensic mental health services.\\nNot a legal mental health professional but I\\'ve dealt with the police in regards to mental health issues and they were never great. \\n\\nI\\'m not a full on religious hippy turn the other cheek kind of guy, I do believe vengeance isn\\'t always a bad thing, some people will never learn and often a kick in the teeth is the only thing they understand and the best form of justice anyone\\'s ever going to get when some waste of spaces are involved....\\n\\nThat being said, I don\\'t view our legal system as a punishment system, I try to view it as a necessary evil in some cases, and a possible path to rehabilitation in best cases. \\n\\n\\nAll you have to ask yourself is, will pressing charges against this person improve their situation in the long term, or keep others safe?\\n\\nIf the answer to both those questions is no, you\\'re left only with vengeance, and does that person deserve to at least suffer for what they did.\\n\\nIf criminal charges aren\\'t going to help them sort their issues out, they aren\\'t a threat to others so the charges won\\'t keep others safe, and you at the very least won\\'t feel good about getting them punished, what\\'s even left to ask.\\n\\n-------\\nThat’s crisis support mainly. But yeah there is a culture of “we won’t help until you’ve proved you’re a danger to yourself or others”. \\n\\nGeneral mental health support, i.e. therapy, for those not in crisis is free on the NHS and anyone can refer.\\nNot necessarily the right call.

I carried my manager through server illness when his family was not there, and was shown the same kindness during Covid, where I would receive multiple calls everyday to ensure I have everything I needed since I was isolated and was living away from my family. I could not imagine missing a funeral of someone close to me. This takes a lot lesser time than you think. Not everyone has to go but at least one or two people working with Anna should have. \\n\\nHow would I assure that funerals of the employees that pass are attended? I hope I never have to work in a place so devoid of humanity, where I have to monitor, whether this bare minimum social obligation is fulfilled. People not attending funeral of their colleague points to deeper cultural and organisational issues within the firm. In my opinion, taking action to ensure funerals are being attended would be more of a symptomatic treatment. \\n\\nOne thing I would look into would be to make sure that we are hiring people with high EQ and empathy in general. This would be a long term measure. A short term measure can be to have subordinate's work satisfaction tied to manager's KPI. This will reduce exploitation in workplace and will help support a more humane work culture.\\n\\nHonestly, It's hard for me to imagine that people need to be taught this, but partners may be called out in high level meeting, in front of their counterparts as their department failed to show basic empathy to someone working in their team. They might not be directly responsible, and I know this might seem emotionally immature, but fear of having a negative impression on the management, which may result in professional stagnation is just about the motivators for partners in these firms. Not saying that partners themselves should go, but someone in the team should, and a fear or reprimand would help the partner prioritise this.\\nI think this is a cultural/regional thing. \\n\\nWhere I live, it's a little rude if you don't attend the wake or shiva of a colleague's family member. So much so that company wide emails with wake info in a workplace with hundreds are not just commonplace but expected. There are people who keep it to just a family goodbye, and in that case, the family's wishes are respected. However, if they're holding hours of any sort, it's socially important that you go to the wake. Especially if you worked closely or were in that person's department. Have a good excuse if you miss it. No one would act outright offended, but some people might actuallt be hurt. The funeral service is a little more personal, not expected, but still not at all odd to net a complete to dozens of colleagues. \\n\\nI'm an atheist from a very secular family that  doesn't do wakes or funerals, and yet I've been to so, so many wakes for people I don't know at all.\\n\\nYes, this cultural expectation means you also get invited to the baby showers and the weddings and all that. It's exhausting.\\nThat's not the situation in the article though. This was the deceased's co-workers. Depending on tenure it would be likely that a nontoxic workplace would have people show at the funeral as friends. Certainly there was a few people from various places my dad worked at his funeral, going back to the late 70s and 80s\\nDepending on your workplace… your colleagues actually see more of you on a daily basis than your own family so it’s not weird that some of then want to say goodbye\"},\n",

Earlier this year I ended my LTR with John and started dating Paul who is polyamorous. I\\'m insecure but I\\'m trying my best. The break up did not have to do with Paul. John moved out but ended finding work in our hometown and I allowed him to move back in where we started dating again. Paul and John know I am polyamorous and am dating both of them. Paul and John do not particularly like one another but are being nice for my sake. I\\'m not forcing them to be in each other\\'s company unless both parties are ok with it. I\\'ve made it clear to both of them that they can leave if they are unhappy/uncomfortable. I will not break up with one of them if the other asks, it\\'s not fair to me or the other party, this is also clear information to John and Paul. Paul is also the one who suggested I could be polyamorous with both him and John.\\n\\nHere\\'s where I need advice; how do I balance two partners, my job, and honestly myself? John and Paul both say I\\'m not giving them enough time, I barely sleep and I feel like I\\'m drowning. I want them to both know I\\'m here for them and care for them, but they both have voiced complaints of not enough me time. I live with John so I literally see him about everyday and will forgo sleep to take him out. I see Paul about every other day and will forgo sleep to spend time at his house or go out with him. Paul is afraid I\\'m going to go back to mono with John and I keep trying to reassure him but it falls on deaf ears.\\n\\nI also need help on how to better communicate that I feel left out on group activities that involve Paul and his girlfriend Kate. I literally have to act like Paul and I aren\\'t dating when the three of us are out. Paul and I won\\'t hold hands, will keep an arms distance between us and try not to talk one on one because Kate will become uncomfortably standoffish. I try to talk to her but she won\\'t speak to me and Paul insists I should go on these outings with them. I get along with Kate\\'s husband Henry just fine, we talk and banter and he treats me like a part of the group. It\\'s awkward and draining and I\\'m not sure if Paul is not reassuring Kate or what is going on there. I don\\'t know if I should bring this to her directly or to Paul. Kate was initially fine with me but as Paul and I got more serious these cold behaviors towards me began. Also, if I decline going out with them Paul says I\\'m a flake or not trying and I have to give up some, what should be fun, experiences ie: festivals, concerts, movies. I\\'ve tried to tell Paul I feel left out but it feels like he doesn\\'t hear me. Paul will also go out of his way to make time for Kate and expects me to just be available so it feels like I\\'m sacrificing more of my time and wellbeing to see him and it\\'s causing a bit of jealousy on my end.\\n\\nIt\\'s becoming exhausting. I feel like I can\\'t keep my head above water and that no matter how hard I\\'m trying someone is unhappy with me. I just want to love and be loved but this is taking a toll on my mental health.\\n\\nTLDR: I\\'m trying to be a good partner to both my boyfriends but they both feel like it\\'s not enough. One of my boyfriend\\'s girlfriend doesn\\'t like me to the point I don\\'t want to be alone with him and her, and I\\'m unsure how to discuss this with him.\\n\\nPlease be gentle but constructive, I feel beat up as is but really want to make this work.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/polyamory) if you have any questions or concerns.*\\nI just want to say.\\n\\nJohn is an adult man. So is Paul. It is *okay* for them to be disappointed sometimes. That is not a big problem you need to fix. If John and Paul need more robust social lives, they can pull on their big boy pants and go make friends. That is a problem *only they* can fix.

       "  'comments': 'In general, I don\\'t think it\\'s possible to stereotype reactions to authority in various parts of the US in this way. And reading through this thread, it seems like what you perceive as a lack of empathy is people being generally confused at why it\\'s bad that students already on academic probation ended up getting kicked out of JHU. Because of this, I don\\'t think they\\'re willing to engage with legitimate concerns like failure to accommodate medical conditions or the refusal to allow grade appeals (if that is normally common practice). It seems like it\\'s a mix of people who might not have been a good fit for the program (or whose mental health struggles may have been a contributing factor in making them poor students) combined with some questionable at best administrative decisions. I guess the question is what you\\'re hoping this post will accomplish. It\\'s a private university so I\\'m not quite sure what you\\'d like Marylanders to do with this information.\\nI really get how complicated this situation is, but as I mentioned, r/Maryland has been uniquely dismissive of these concerns. Reading closely, it’s clear that the lack of checks and balances and the inability to appeal grades led many students to be put into probation unfairly, often for sketchy reasons. For instance, a racist professor discriminated against Black students, and the lack of oversight allowed professors to have unchecked power over their students’ academic fates. In Adam’s story, if Christina Harnett had agreed to give him an incomplete like every other professor did, he would’ve graduated. And many of the students in the story were only forced into academic probation after they revealed disabilities and professors began treating them more harshly as a result. \\n\\nThe systemic issues I’m highlighting—like the inability to appeal grades and the lack of accommodations—are critical to understanding why students are struggling. While there may be individual factors at play, that doesn’t negate the need for accountability and reform within the program. Additionally, mental health conditions are ADA-protected, meaning universities have a responsibility to provide appropriate support.\\n\\nThe program is even having trouble hiring new faculty because these stories are well-known within the counseling community. My goal in sharing this is to raise awareness of these issues and foster understanding, encouraging a more constructive conversation about how to improve the situation for current and future students\\n\\nBtw, people were more sympathetic 2 years ago when it first came out, funnily enough: https://archive.ph/wip/QNSDt\\nHere, just from reddit. Otherwise, a lot more convo in the field goes on outside reddit as you can probably guess. I’m connected with quite a few therapists and therapy profs in the state given my background and yes, the program has a toxic rep. Some local sites even no longer work with the program to do internships now. Loyola’s program even reached out to Katie saying they couldn’t believe what happened to her and invited her to apply to their program. Counselors vote with their feet by avoiding working at the program, hence they had to make some adjuncts fi time just to get their numbers to 11 (was 15 in 2019). This summer, [they even posted a desperate hire for an 1-year-term faculty for this school year](https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/37694968/lecturer/#:~:text=The%20Johns%20Hopkins%20University%20School,and%20Clinical%20Mental%20Health%20Counseling.): **it’s almost October and no one filled the position.** Over 15 testimonials submitted to the Office of Civil Rights too just one this one program. \\n\\nhttps://archive.ph/KWjkD\\n\\nhttps://archive.ph/TmcJL\\n\\nRegarding the original post that caused so much backlash here, therapists subreddit was sympathetic and even got reddit gold from it: https://archive.ph/DwgPx\\n\\nThe backlash on r/maryland also did not occur on the Hopkins subreddit. other posters shared struggles in another department: https://archive.ph/wip/5GQXN\\n\\nOne example, you might\\'ve heard of Sheppard Pratt, a pretty big and well known mental health system in the area. They have big issues with JHU Counseling because the program teaches that Dissociative Identity Disorder doesn\\'t exist, and other problematic things. Also, when we first lost our accreditation our Dean rashly sent an email to every supervisor in Maryland saying that JHU would allow students to graduate early then have them finish their internship credits afterwards so they can be grandfathered into CACREP, which is illegal. After this happened, a lot of JHU graduates had more trouble finding jobs for awhile. \\n\\n**A student who managed to graduate sent me this. She, and many others, were also forced onto probation plans. Even JHU\\'s equity office admitted that the program was giving them out inappropriately:** \\n\\n*I am a student with documented disabilities. I had a terrible experience with a professor last year in my first semester. I was working on a group project and there was a lot of confusion in my group about what was expected for the project. I was the only person that was brave enough to ask the professor for clarity. I wanted to advocate for my group because they didn\\'t feel comfortable asking. I then heard from one of my group members that the professor complained about me asking so many questions. Then I got a phone call on a Sunday morning from the professor in which she said “I know you have disabilities, but not all your professors are going to be as understanding as I am”. I was NOT having any problems in any of my other classes or with other professors. Her class was the only class in which this was an issue. When I told her that I was asking these questions on behalf of other students in the class, she didn\\'t believe me and told me that I was the only one that she was getting questions from. I then told my classmates that I refused to ask any more questions of the professor and that they had to ask them themselves.*\\n\\n*When I shared this experience with other people, they told me I should speak to my advisor about it but unfortunately this professor is my advisor. This experience left such a bad taste in my mouth that I no longer trust my advisor. Now I feel like I am often lost in the dark not knowing about important information about the program because I\\'m too scared to ask my advisor.*\\n\\n*I have a lot of deep-seated trauma from the experience I had as a disabled student in public school growing up. I wanted to become a school counselor so that other people didn\\'t have the same experience that I did. But the way that I\\'ve been treated in this program has been retraumatizing and brings back a lot of memories from my childhood. I hate it when people in my life inquire about my grad school experience because I have nothing positive to share. I would never recommend this program to anyone, ever. I have gone into a life time of debt and have to spend the rest of my life paying off my student loans for a program that has mutilated my spirit.*\\n\\n**A second student**\\n\\n*I\\'m not sure if this can help, but I wanted to share something I went through in my internship that seemed extremely unfair. I do not have a disability, but it was enough to put me on blood pressure medication and anxiety medication which seemed counterproductive for a counseling grad student*\\n\\n*I did the program in school counseling. My internship supervisor was Dr. X. When the time came to make my video, I discussed it with my site supervisor and we decided I would use a student with whom I had formed a good relationship and had ongoing sessions. This student had a long history of trauma and often doubted her ability to cope with issues as they arose. Before the video, my site supervisor and I went over the content we would discuss in detail and my site supervisor was very excited about what I had planned. I had the student come in for the video and tell me about her week, then we did an activity where she wrote coping skills on paper tools and put them in a paper toolbox. I showed the video, and Dr. X called me into her office the next day. She proceeded to tell me that my video was one of the most unethical she had ever seen, and if I ever did something like that again, she \"would not hesitate to kick [me] out of the program so fast [my] head would spin.\" I still don\\'t really understand it, but I guess because I led the student in an activity and didn\\'t just let her ramble about soccer for a half hour, I breached some kind of ethical guideline? My site supervisor was furious and both she and her supervisor said that they would defend me against the university if it came to that. I\\'m now in my 4th year as a school counselor and regularly tell kids \"we\\'re not gonna talk about that - either do this project or go back to class.\" If only Dr. X could see me now.....*\\n\\n*I always thought it was ironic that in a program that was supposed to be teaching us to be compassionate and empathetic professionals, most of the professors had no compassion or empathy. I never felt like I could make a mistake - I felt like the gatekeeping meant I had to be perfect 100% of the time. Since moving to another city and working with interns at other programs where growth and mistakes are encouraged, it makes me sad that Hopkins, with such a great reputation, makes their students so neurotic and fearful.*\\n\\n\\n**Across JHU:**\\n\\nDisabled engineering student: https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2022/09/professors-and-deans-can-do-what-they-like-to-disabled-students\\n\\nAdditional undergrads: https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2021/10/students-with-disabilities-report-exclusion-and-discrimination-on-campus\\n\\nAnd disabled students sharing their experiences in Hopkins subreddit: https://archive.ph/wip/WEMAq\\n\\n\\nhttps://archive.ph/wip/pokyL\\n\\n***\\nAnyway, it\\'s valid to question the credibility of students who couldn’t maintain their grades. However, I think it’s important to acknowledge that the issues being raised go beyond individual academic performance. These students weren’t simply struggling with coursework—they were often placed on probation after revealing disabilities or facing other forms of discrimination, which suggests that their academic difficulties were exacerbated by a lack of appropriate support and unfair treatment. Revealing disabilities made things much stricter and less supportive for them (such as Katie being forced to work with COVID positive clients unlike other students, and the unfair treatment subsequently tanking her mental health and performance).\\n\\nAgain, even the students you don\\'t sympathize with were put on a path to struggle and failure that could have been entirely avoided if the program had been less toxic and more supportive. For example, if Christina Harnett had agreed to give Adam an incomplete, like other professors did, he would have graduated instead of being forced into a situation where he ultimately couldn’t succeed.\\n\\nThe systemic problems I’m highlighting—like the inability to appeal grades, lack of accommodations, and unchecked power given to professors—are broader issues that can affect any student, regardless of their academic standing. The reputation JHU is developing in the counseling field reflects these deeper concerns. **It’s telling that they’ve struggled to hire new faculty, and their enrollment has dropped significantly in just one year since these articles became public. My own advisor is gone now.** \\n\\nWhile I understand your experience with nursing, business, and med students didn’t reflect these issues, each department operates differently. The problems in the counseling program may not be as visible in other areas, but that doesn’t negate their existence. I’m sharing these stories to raise awareness because these aren’t isolated incidents—they’re part of a larger pattern that needs addressing'},\n",

It’s about the collective struggle we’re facing as social workers and mental health providers—fighting a system that continues to turn its back on both us and the vulnerable populations we serve. The issue isn’t about individuals trying to play the savior, but rather the lack of systemic support from lawmakers and organizations like MCOs. This is about advocating for the profession, for justice, and for those who rely on us, while acknowledging the pain and frustration of feeling left to fight alone.\\n\\nThe post reflects the deeper commitment we have as social workers, grounded in our core values of social justice and service. It’s about refusing to accept apathy from those in power and continuing to fight for a system that supports both providers and clients. This isn’t an egocentric fight—it’s a collective one, rooted in our ethical obligation to stand up for what’s right, even when it feels like the world isn’t listening.\\nAh, there it is—thinking in singular. That’s exactly the issue. The overwhelming majority of social workers and mental health providers thrive on collective action. Research consistently shows that collaborative care models improve outcomes for clients—studies from the *Journal of Interprofessional Care* and *Social Work in Health Care* make it clear that teamwork is essential in addressing complex needs and improving health outcomes. If we stick with this ‘I’ instead of ‘we’ mentality, it’s no wonder the system is falling apart. Viewing this work through a singular lens only pushes our profession—and the vulnerable populations we serve—into a deeper crisis. We’re already facing a critical shortage of mental health providers, with demand rising and financial strain increasing on individual providers.\\n\\nYou absolutely have the right to your autonomy and perspective, which I respect—but it’s not just me who refuses to sit back and be silent. There’s a growing movement within our profession that rejects the passive, singular approach. Groups of providers across the country—like *The Behavioral Health Provider Alliance* and *The Psychotherapy Action Network*—are joining forces to fight for real reform. These grassroots efforts are tackling critical issues like fair reimbursement rates, reducing provider burnout, and improving access to mental health care for underserved communities. Providers are recognizing that collective action is the only way to bring about the meaningful changes we all need. Maybe it’s time to look through a different lens—because isolation isn’t going to move the needle, but unified action will.'},\n",

It hurt to watch them fight and him basically be her punching bag. This big strong man who was and is my idol and hero being brought low by my cheating lying whore of a mother. Even knowing what she was doing was wrong, it still impressed upon me this fucked up idea that women are allowed to abuse men all they like and a man isn\\'t supposed to defend himself. And so when a woman sexually assaulted me I did nothing to defend myself. I cowered like he did to my mother\\'s abuse. It took years to reflect on what happened to me and deprogram this idea of never defending yourself against a woman. Against men who attempted, defending myself was second nature, but against a woman I fucking froze and cowered out. THAT is what you\\'re teaching your children, that it\\'s okay to abuse men so long as the abuser is a woman. For your kids sake you need to grow a fucking spine and exit this marriage.\\nThis is a joke, right? Man, you gotta get a spine and tell her to fuck off. This gonna sound rough, but Jesus Christ... You texted him and apologized for running at the car? I get it, he might not have known the situation because your wife lied to him at first, but he damn sure knows  now. I wouldn\\'t even pretend to consider letting my wife be friends with someone that she cheated on my with. I would have divorced her after gathering enough evidence to support me in court and  take her to court for custody. I know that wouldn\\'t be easy, but I\\'d still go that route. Your kids are seeing this play out to some degree, at the very least they are feeling the \"vibe\". Time to show them how a strong man handles business. For your mental health, and for their future.\\nIf your therapist is telling you that a decision is the best one they recommend for your mental health, then listen to them. She doesn\\'t care about you at all. Leave her\\n\\nNTA\\nDon\\'t be an idiot...staying with a cheater is not benefiting the kids in any way, shape, or form. You think the kids want to be exposed to you two fighting and her cheating? You think hurting your mental health helps the kids at all? Divorce the garden tool and file custody for the kids.\\nNTA, what you\\'re actually doing, in \"staying for the kids\", is teaching them to be a doormat and that cheating is A OK. Leave. It\\'s in your and your children\\'s best interest, and best for your mental health and feelings of self worth.\\n>My family, friends, co-workers, and therapist all say divorce is in my best interest.

She has no respect for you. She made her choice long ago, she chose her boyfriend over you and your kids. She blew up the family, not you. Your mental health is important. Divorce her and move on.

It’s clear as day you need to get divorced and get her out of your life! \\n\\nI cannot believe her calling you selfish hasn’t caused you to turn that on her and say she’s the one that was selfish when she cheated and continues to be selfish by seeing this person. She’s at fault for everything wrong in your relationship and is the cause of your divorce. She is the cause of your mental health issues, your wrecked emotions, and yet she has the audacity to go out with this man again and have him drop her off at your house only to tell you not to get divorced for the sake of the kids? Get divorced now and don’t worry about her anymore. She clearly doesn’t respect you or wants you so why should you continue caring about her? Give your all to your kids, to your mental health, and in due time you’ll find someone who will love you and respect you. Best of luck!\\nYour wife and a cold, selfish and disrespectful! She doesn\\'t love you nor does she respect you. To have her love come to your house to stop her off is mind blowing! How dare you call him to apologize for yelling at him!!

And she’s been taking full advantage of it and warping my thoughts. When I barged out to confront him I had a completely different mindset than apologizing for anything. I was going to vent everything at him. Then she and I argued after he bolted off and she did her thing. Where she makes me think I was int eh wrong. I wanted to tell him off but at that point my fire had burned out and that’s the best  came up with. Yes I’m not proud of that response and definitely not what I would have said. But I stated the sheriff will be involved if he shows up again and I absolutely will uphold that.\\n\\nI called the attorney and getting that started up again.  I have plenty of evidence I need to support all my claims. The kids also are definitely mine.\\nHer telling me she slept with this guy right before our anniversary and first couples therapy session absolutely broke me. Like if my mental health was a 80/100 it went down to 3/100 it hurt terribly. We went to the session she didn’t say anything and we didn’t go again after. Then she started getting abusive towards me, started with calling me names, yelling screaming, and moved to throwing and breaking things, wrecking the house and finally hitting me. My left eye has permanent damage. It’s not a lot but it’s still there. I was broken and didn’t know how the fuck to handle anything. I wasn’t like that before just that blow killed a huge part of me.\\nShe has a way with word and turning thing around and my mental health has been in shambles the past year. I’m doing my best to just stay afloat.\\nOnly option.  For the record she is gaslighting you by saying you are being controlling.  Remaining in contact with affair partner when she claims to not want a divorce is the most unbelievable thing I’ve ever heard. \\n\\nAlso don’t take care of the guys feelings.  He can handle it.  Don’t apologize for yelling even if your wife lied to him and said it was open.  \\n\\nYou only have one thing to worry about right now which is your mental health which includes getting your divorce settled.  Kids will be fine, especially given how volatile your relationship is.  You don’t want to model to them that this is ok.\\nOP, this is horrible! \\n\\nFrom now on, record EVERYTHING! Every outburst, conversation, and confrontation. Document EVERYTHING!\\n\\nI’m pretty sure she will accuse you of being abusive and controlling during the divorce to get full custody of your kids so she can weaponize them against you. She’s not your wife, she’s your nightmare, and you must get rid of her.\\n\\nDon’t stay for the kids. What kind of example do you want to set for them? That it’s best to stay with a cheating, manipulative and abusive partner so your kids can live in a toxic household?\\n\\nYou need to do what’s best for you and your mental health.\\n\\nNTA\\nYou rug swept what happened, she never had to face what she did to you. You can’t heal because the wound was never cleaned. If you want to stay then I would suggest you find a marriage counselor who specializes in infidelity and work on healing. If not that wound will fester for your entire life, and when your son is grown it will destroy your mental health, you’ll have nothing to hang staying with her on. It could shorten your life.

It\\'s called **\"The Here and Now Habit\" (2016) by Hugh G Byrne PhD** I got it from the library, actually. Finally reading it this time and it\\'s my new current book project! 😁😀🤩\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSupport is certainly helpful and great but Shanny is missing the CRUCIAL link between accountable accountability, responsibility, toughness and structure that such specific ED and mental health programs would offer (as you\\'ve stated). If she could do it all on her own, she would have recovered years ago. But, she can\\'t, doesn\\'t have to, and it won\\'t work nearly as effectively if she just let down her walls and let someone from the professional sphere of things help her out and teach her the skills she needs to replace the unhealthy behaviors. \\n\\nThat would require some insight, a want to change, a desire for a better life and stripping herself from the parasocial, inappropriate and unhealthy relationships she\\'s cultivated for years with her audience. Which is a hefty task. Still possible though. Just makes it all a little less likely to happen--Shanny might see it as having to give up something she thought she was or wished to be and coming to grips with everything she\\'s actually done to people over the years which could be a lot and rather heavy. It\\'s *still* worth it because her life is important and matters, I just wish she\\'d allow herself to see that, exist in that, BE in that and live in that. But alas, I\\'ve gone on the tangents again.... \\n\\nThanks for reading and stopping by, Alison!! Neuroplasticity is always an interesting topic. 💜💜💙💙\\U0001fa75\\U0001fa75🧠🧠🧠\\nNeuroplasticity is the ability for our brains to form new connections in order to function.  They used to think this ended in childhood, but we form new connections throughout our life.  A good example is when you move houses.  You might drive halfway home only to find out you were driving to the old house.  That\\'s Neuroplasticity - you have a hardwired neuro connection that automatically thinks of home as the place you used to live.  Over time, with repeatedly reminding yourself of your new location, the new house becomes home, and becomes the new \"automatic\" home connection you make when commuting back to your house.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how it works with personality deficits after a disruption, but for physical stuff like talking and walking after an accident, it\\'s teaching the person to reconnect the intact brain tissue to circumvent the damaged parts.  More than one area of the brain works to perform all of our functions, and they work together.  So the person might need to relearn speech through their ability to sing, for example.  They might not remember how to speak, but since singing comes from a creative side of the brain, they may remember that function.  So over time their ability to sing will help them tap into their ability to build words into sentences.  Very fascinating.\\n\\nWhen it comes to an undamaged brain creating new connections, it\\'s all about weakening the existing neuro connections by not indulging in them and actively choosing a new response to the same stimuli, every time.  That\\'s why ED treatment can work for bulimia if a person wants it.  At a treatment center they are given calculated meals catered to their needs, already prepared.  They are not given enough for a proper binge.  They are also being monitored on their bathroom use afterwards, and have staff and other patients to help them work through hard feelings.  But with enough time and real effort and desire, a person can and will recover from anything.  \\n\\nNeuroplasticity is also now being used for mental health, EMDR is a great example - trying to neutralize the body\\'s natural response to certain memories or triggers.'},\n",

       "  'comments': 'The problem with mental health support in this country is that they will flat out refuse to help anyone until they \"hurt themselves or others\" which to me is fucking stupid. \\n\\nYou should report them immediately and they will hopefully get the help they need. You\\'re doing a good thing if you report them so don\\'t worry about it.\\nYou don’t ‘press charges’ in the uk. You alert the authorities and they make an educated decision on how to proceed. One of those routes will be to get them the mental health support they need.\\n\\nYou would be doing the correct thing to report them.\\nYes absolutely you should.\\n\\nFirst, if people are in the middle of a crisis, they still need repurcutions for their actions. If only just to push them to solve their issues.\\n\\nBut really, it should be up to the courts to decide their punishment and if this really was down to a mental health issue then they\\'ll be pushed to fix that. The courts may determine they\\'re not safe to others too and may be taken away from people. Because while tragic and terrible it might be for them, the simple matter is they can\\'t go around attacking people and if they\\'re going to do it again they need to be put somewhere where they can be helped but also not be a danger to others.\\n\\nTheir mental health issues won\\'t be of much concern to the friends and family of a fatal attack victim.\\n\\nIf I was going to be a danger to people, I\\'d want to be put in a hospital or wherever. It could even be my own loved ones that I\\'d attack and the last thing I want is to be roaming around a danger to people. I would want to get the help I need and going through the courts is a way of getting that.\\nYes because its the right thing to do, and may mean that the person can access forensic mental health services.\\nNot a legal mental health professional but I\\'ve dealt with the police in regards to mental health issues and they were never great. \\n\\nI\\'m not a full on religious hippy turn the other cheek kind of guy, I do believe vengeance isn\\'t always a bad thing, some people will never learn and often a kick in the teeth is the only thing they understand and the best form of justice anyone\\'s ever going to get when some waste of spaces are involved....\\n\\nThat being said, I don\\'t view our legal system as a punishment system, I try to view it as a necessary evil in some cases, and a possible path to rehabilitation in best cases. \\n\\n\\nAll you have to ask yourself is, will pressing charges against this person improve their situation in the long term, or keep others safe?\\n\\nIf the answer to both those questions is no, you\\'re left only with vengeance, and does that person deserve to at least suffer for what they did.\\n\\nIf criminal charges aren\\'t going to help them sort their issues out, they aren\\'t a threat to others so the charges won\\'t keep others safe, and you at the very least won\\'t feel good about getting them punished, what\\'s even left to ask.\\n\\n-------\\nThat’s crisis support mainly. But yeah there is a culture of “we won’t help until you’ve proved you’re a danger to yourself or others”. \\n\\nGeneral mental health support, i.e. therapy, for those not in crisis is free on the NHS and anyone can refer.\\nNot necessarily the right call. I know a lady who suffers with mental health issues and was mid flashback when a police officer tried to intervene. She panicked and attacked him and now has assaulting an officer on her criminal record. She\\'s trying to get out of a domestic abuse situation which is aggravating her mental health but nowhere will take her because of her record.\\n\\nThis person needs medical help, not punishment.'},\n",

It’s funny how the moment we start talking solutions, people like you turn off your brain and start spewing the same tired dismissals. Let’s break this down for the folks playing along at home.\\n\\n# 1. “Say something unique for once.”\\n\\nYou mean unique like the innovative idea that human beings deserve to live with dignity? Or unique like suggesting worker cooperatives, universal healthcare, and a Green New Deal as practical steps to overhaul a broken system? Maybe it’s not “unique” because these ideas are supported by mountains of evidence and the lived experiences of people tired of being ground down by a system that prioritizes profit over people. Just because you’ve heard these solutions before doesn’t make them any less valid—or necessary.\\n\\n# 2. “Paranoid leftist”\\n\\nCalling concerns about wealth inequality, climate change, and the exploitation of labor “paranoia” is like calling a fire alarm annoying while the building burns down around you. It’s not paranoia when the evidence is staring you in the face. We’re living in a world where a handful of billionaires hoard more wealth than half the global population, the planet’s on a fast track to ecological collapse, and millions struggle to access basic necessities. That’s not paranoia; it’s reality.\\n\\n# 3. “Gish-gallop slop”\\n\\nTranslation: “I can’t keep up with the arguments, so I’ll dismiss them all at once.” The term “gish-gallop” refers to overwhelming an opponent with numerous points, true or not, to drown them in details. Here’s the thing—each point I made was substantive and backed by real-world examples. Worker cooperatives exist and thrive. Universal healthcare is a reality in multiple countries. UBI has been tested successfully in various places. If your response to detailed solutions is to call them “slop,” maybe the issue isn’t the argument but your inability to engage with it.\\n\\n# 4. What’s Actually Paranoid?\\n\\nBelieving that challenging capitalism means descending into chaos and dystopia—that’s paranoid. Believing that any critique of the current system is an attack on “freedom”—that’s paranoid. Clinging to a system that clearly doesn’t work for most people while pretending it’s the best we can do? That’s delusional.\\n\\n# 5. If This is “Slop,” What’s Your Gourmet?\\n\\nI laid out concrete, actionable solutions: democratizing workplaces, universal healthcare, UBI, breaking up monopolies, and a Green New Deal. If you’ve got a better plan for fixing a system that’s clearly broken, let’s hear it. But something tells me you’re more interested in throwing out dismissive buzzwords than engaging in an actual discussion.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I’ll keep saying what I’m saying, because it’s what needs to be said. If that bores you, maybe take a hard look at why you find the prospect of a fairer, more just world so uninteresting.\\n**Reply:**\\n\\nAlright, let’s slice through your rhetoric and get to the meat of the argument.\\n\\n1. **\"The solutions I laid out are real, actionable, and backed by data.\"**\\n   * **Worker Cooperatives:** Let\\'s start with Mondragon in Spain. Far from being some utopian fantasy, it\\'s a collection of cooperatives that employs around 80,000 people and generates billions in revenue annually. Mondragon competes globally, manufacturing everything from industrial machines to consumer goods. [Grassroots Economic Organizing](https://geo.coop/gleanings/how-mondragon-became-worlds-largest-co-op) provides comprehensive data on its success, including higher worker satisfaction and fair profit distribution. This model isn’t a theory; it’s a thriving reality.\\n   * **Universal Basic Income (UBI):** Various UBI pilots, such as those in Finland and Stockton, California, have demonstrated that providing a guaranteed income improves financial security, mental health, and even local economies. The [Roosevelt Institute](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/the-macroeconomic-effects-of-a-ubi) reported that a UBI could add $2.5 trillion to the U.S. economy over eight years. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s backed by real-world data.\\n2. **\"Most of your claims are political rhetoric.\"**\\n   * If you think calling out systemic issues is just “political rhetoric,” you’re missing the point. This isn’t about ideology—it’s about facts. Wealth inequality is skyrocketing, healthcare costs are ruining lives, and the environment is collapsing. These aren’t abstract concepts, they’re measurable crises. Ignoring them doesn’t make them disappear.\\n3. **\"You are hiding the ball.\"**\\n   * Hiding the ball? I’m laying it all out right here. Your argument that \"workers owning the means of production\" leads to totalitarianism is a weak strawman. Democratic ownership—such as worker cooperatives—doesn’t resemble centralized authoritarianism. Worker co-ops like Mondragon are transparent, democratic, and self-managed. There’s no dictator here, just collective decision-making. If you’re still equating that to Soviet-style control, it’s time to update your talking points.\\n4. **\"Attempts at proletariat control have led to totalitarianism.\"**\\n   * You’re stuck conflating centralized, top-down authoritarian states with decentralized, worker-controlled cooperatives. Worker co-ops are inherently democratic: one worker, one vote. Compare that to capitalist systems where decisions are made by a few shareholders or CEOs, and tell me again which system resembles feudalism.\\n5. **\"You\\'re just a complainer.\"**\\n   * Ah, the old “complainer” argument. Guess what? Critique isn’t the same as inaction. My “whining” on Reddit? It’s called spreading awareness, sharing solutions, and engaging in discourse that leads to action. You might not like the format, but digital platforms are where real activism lives today. If you think the only valid form of activism involves picket lines, you\\'re decades behind.\\n6. **\"I got the data to prove it and you don\\'t.\"**\\n   * Then bring it. So far, all I’ve seen is deflection and empty claims. Drop the sources, show the studies. Until then, I’ll continue presenting real-world examples like Mondragon and UBI pilots that have been studied and proven effective.\\n\\n**tl;dr**: I’m here presenting solutions backed by evidence. If you want to keep shouting slogans, be my guest. But don’t expect me to take your “certified DUMB ASS!” badge seriously until you bring something more to the table than empty buzzwords and ad hominems.\\n\\nThe floor is yours.\\n> Various UBI pilots, such as those in Finland and Stockton, California, have demonstrated that providing a guaranteed income improves financial security, mental health, and even local economies. The Roosevelt Institute reported that a UBI could add $2.5 trillion to the U.S. economy over eight years. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s backed by real-world data. \\n\\nThese are **just** pilots, which are affordable for a small group of people for a limited time. It would be utterly unaffordable to implement UBI for everyone, indefinitely. I think the experience of handing out free money during the Covid pandemic ought to made this obvious. We are going to take years to pay off the debt which was incurred for these programs.\\n\\nIf you want to advocate for UBI, show us where the money will come from - and please don\\'t say something vague like: \"from the billionaires and large corporations\" - provide actual numbers. \\n\\nOh, and your link to the Roosevelt Institute \\'report\\' doesn\\'t go anywhere. Nice try.\\n\\n>Worker co-ops like Mondragon are transparent, democratic, and self-managed. \\n\\nMondragon is worker owned, but not worker managed.\\n\\n>Compare that to capitalist systems where decisions are made by a few shareholders or CEOs, and tell me again which system resembles feudalism. \\n\\nActually, most large corporations are widely held, with tens of thousands of shareholders electing directors, who in turn hire CEO and other executives to run companies. It is **NOTHING AT ALL LIKE FEUDALISM.**\\n\\n>Until then, I’ll continue presenting real-world examples like Mondragon \\n\\nMondragon is the **ONLY** real-world example that you keep presenting, over and over again. I find it notable that you cannot come up with other examples.'},\n",

       "  'comments': 'Ah, the classic “This is just a rant” dismissal. Nice attempt to sidestep the entire critique by calling it too emotional, too long, and too… well, whatever you need to justify not engaging with the actual points. Let’s break down your response.\\n\\n# \"No Argument Given\"\\n\\nThe entire post is a string of arguments. If you missed them, it’s because you chose not to see them. Pointing out systemic exploitation, environmental destruction, and the illusion of choice is not just “talking”—it’s laying bare the mechanics of a broken system. If that’s not an argument, then maybe the problem isn’t my post; it’s your ability to recognize one.\\n\\n# \"No Evidence Presented\"\\n\\nDo we really need to drag out every statistic and citation to prove the obvious? Millions are struggling to afford basic healthcare, the planet is burning, and wealth inequality is soaring. These aren’t fringe opinions; they’re widely documented realities. If you need a bibliography for every sentence, you’re not looking for a debate—you’re looking for a way to ignore the points being made.\\n\\n# \"No End Goals or Pathways\"\\n\\nThis post wasn’t a policy brief; it was a wake-up call. But since you asked, the pathways are simple: dismantle corporate monopolies, democratize the workplace, implement universal healthcare, and prioritize sustainability over profit. It’s not that complicated, but it does require acknowledging that the status quo isn’t working.\\n\\n# \"Too Long to Care\"\\n\\nTranslation: “I didn’t actually read it, but I’ll pretend it’s just too long to bother with.” The length is only an issue if you’re unwilling to confront uncomfortable truths. If you’ve got time to type out a critique of the length, you’ve got time to engage with the content.\\n\\n# \"Agree to Disagree\"\\n\\nSure, we can “agree to disagree” if by that you mean agreeing to ignore the problems and pretend everything’s fine. But that’s not a debate—that’s sticking your head in the sand. If you really think these issues are just subjective opinions, then you’re missing the whole point. This isn’t about agreement; it’s about facing reality.\\n\\nSo, no, it’s not “just a rant.” It’s a call to action. If that’s too much for you, maybe the problem isn’t the post—it’s that the truth makes you uncomfortable.\\nLet\\'s break down your concerns one by one because there\\'s a lot to unpack.\\n\\n**\\'Work or Die\\':** Socialism isn\\'t about lounging while luxuries magically appear. It\\'s about ensuring that everyone\\'s basic needs are met so that we aren\\'t forced into soul-crushing jobs just to survive. When people aren\\'t living in fear of destitution, they\\'re free to pursue meaningful work that benefits society. Economic democracy means we all have a say in how our labor is valued and utilized.\\n\\n**\\'Upward Mobility\\':** In a socialist society, there isn\\'t a monolithic \\'GovCorp\\' pulling the strings. Instead, workplaces are collectively owned and managed by those who work there. This decentralization of power means progression is based on contribution and collaboration, not on pleasing distant corporate overlords or political elites. True freedom is when everyone has an equal voice, not when a few hold all the cards.\\n\\n**\\'Economic Cannibalism\\':** Currently, capitalism has led to monopolies that dominate markets and suppress competition. Under socialism, the goal is to eliminate these monopolies by distributing ownership among the workers and the community. This prevents any single entity from wielding oppressive power. Economic decisions are made democratically, ensuring they serve the public good rather than private interests.\\n\\n**\\'Planet on Fire\\':** It\\'s not paranoia to acknowledge scientific consensus. Climate change is a real and pressing threat exacerbated by unchecked capitalist consumption and exploitation of resources. While nature is resilient, it\\'s not infinite. Socialism promotes sustainable practices by valuing the environment over profit margins, recognizing that our well-being is intrinsically linked to the health of our planet.\\n\\n**\\'Healthcare\\':** You pointed out that both government and private entities can exploit healthcare for profit, and that\\'s a valid concern. However, socialism advocates for healthcare as a fundamental human right, free from profit motives. When the community controls healthcare, with transparency and democratic oversight, it serves the people rather than exploiting them.\\n\\nRegarding the concentration of power, socialism seeks to distribute power more evenly, preventing the 0.01%—who currently hold disproportionate influence—from controlling our lives. By involving everyone in economic decision-making, we dismantle the structures that allow such extreme inequalities.\\n\\nCommunism isn\\'t about handing over control to a tyrannical government; it\\'s about creating a classless society where resources and power are shared equitably. It\\'s about liberation from systems that devalue our humanity. People naturally aspire to create, build, and contribute when they\\'re part of a community that values them.\\n\\nWe need to move past the fear-mongering stereotypes of socialism and communism. They\\'re not dirty words but visions for a future where everyone has the freedom to live fulfilling lives without the chains of exploitation. Let\\'s focus on building a society that nurtures our innate desires to connect, create, and thrive together.'},\n",
