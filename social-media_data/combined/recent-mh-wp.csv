p0001,Neighbour making my home unsafe for my guide dog. Not sure what’s for the best.,20,Blind,Oh he sounds delightful! Not! 🙄 Some people are just so inconsiderate. To some extent it doesn't matter how minor the behaviour is if it's frequent enough then it can still have a huge impact on someone's mental health. Hopefully we can have a nice peaceful future!
p0002,Need some advice on working,7,Blind,I was in a program for clinical mental health counseling. Good luck on the job search and agreed on the online program difficulties.
p0003,My father has done next to nothing for the past two years,1,Blind,"So to start with, I am 54 and became legally blind two years ago. So much of this resonates with me. I am not at all trying to judge your father because this is brutal and I get how he feels.

This all sounds like a form of depression that is very familiar to me, and if a few things were different in my case I could definitely imagine myself getting into the same kind of state. There is a brutal downward spiral effect that just sucked every ounce of willpower and determination out of me on so many days, and whenever it went on for more a day it would get rapidly worse. If things had gone a little differently for me, I could see those days turning into weeks and then months. It is entirely possible that your dad needs mental health professionals helping him at this point, because it just can get that bad. You all might need to get together for a little intervention to get him to seek this help. My prediction would be that he won’t do it independently at this point and will probably be very resistant to the idea. Hopefully you can all come together and show him that you are truly with him and want him to have help.

I went through something similar very recently with another family member who needed that kind of help, and it was not fun. This is going to suck. But from my own experience with these feelings and from what you’re describing, this is probably something that he needs you to do for him.

Now, there is a whole other aspect to this that is also worth investigating, because it sounds like your father needs to cultivate some blind life skills that will help him regain his independence and self identity that he so badly needs right now. I believe that at a certain level of visual impairment you need to develop blind skills or spend the rest of your life thinking everything is closed off to you. I have pretty good acuity for a legally blind person but enough problems to make me have to do almost everything the blind way, as much as possible, so that I can use my little bit of vision for the things it is still good for. I can’t read long text, get very little out of screens and can’t do any fine work visually. I have to use screen readers for everything tech-related and other assistive tech and alternative techniques for everything else. Using these tools is what helps me keep working, keep paying bills, be on the Web and every kind of self fulfillment. Without them I would probably be in exactly the same place as your dad. So, is he using any assistive tech and learning blind life skills? Has he had any kind of assistance from vocational rehab? BESB? Is he using a cane or screen readers?

My guess would be that he is a bit resistant to these things and is trying to do everything like he would as a fully sighted person, which is probably really holding him back. A lot of people our age would try to deny how visually impaired they really are and stay away from all the assistive tech that could free them. This is something that talking to other low vision people could help with, as I’m pretty sure the results are fairly self evident. You just can’t be successful at life as a blind person if you keep on denying that you’re blind.

(I am doing a lot of guessing at he state of his vision here, but even if he is not legally blind he may have enough of a visual impairment that a lot of these things could help him. Canes, for example, aren’t only for the blind. There are quite a few people who are not legally blind but can still benefit from using a cane in situations that require it.)

I think this is a very hard road ahead for all of you, but he needs to get out of that spiral before it’s too late. Please get him talking to other B/VI people and/or mental health professionals. I am happy to talk to any of you in DMs if it will help, but what I really think would help most is real life contact, not a random weirdo on Reddit. (This is also a guess, but I’m guessing that if he was inclined to look for support from Reddit he would already be here.)
Thank you. Your response was very thorough and your assumptions were accurate. I think we do need to bring the focus back to mental health, community and therapy. My step mom is very passive and avoidant when it comes to hard conversations - so I know the  responsibility for dealing with this will be placed on my shoulders. He thinks he is beyond therapy. Have I mentioned I am a therapist? Lol. I do not attempt to do work on my family, way too exhausting. 

He also is very resistant to using technology. I have mentioned screen readers before and he mentions how embarrassing that would be (but shoving your face into your phone to read a text is not? Lol) 
He is just resistant to all of it. We downloaded a magnifying glass app to help him read menus at restaurants and he was telling my husband how embarrassed he is to use it - even though, in reality, no one is paying attention"
p0004,"Looking for support, been visually impaired & a braille reader all my life, used to have some usable sight, lost everything several years ago and still struggling with living in total darkness.",13,Blind,"I was lucky enough to find a great mental health counselor that helped me reinforce using my tools to cope wit vision loss, have you ever tried it?"
p0005,Looking for genuine friends and a support system,23,Blind,"Have you already checked out the r/blind Discord?

Mental health, I'd say, is a struggle for all of us who had vision and lost it. I know my first year, maybe two years was the lowest point I had after almost a decade of becoming healthier, mentally and emotionally.

I lucked out a bit and found a Reddit stranger that helped me through it. Hope that you find one too and you're welcome to reach out over PM. I don't use Reddit chat because it lacks notifications on the browser so I may go days before realizing there are waiting chats."
p0006,Respectful boundary communication with a blind person,32,Blind,"No cheating. Sex is off the table. I think his partner has mental health issues and that is probably the reason.

He had recently completed training with an Orientation and Mobility trainer but he grew up in a wealthier family and I think he is a bit used to people being at his service. I do not intend on doing that.
I understand the feeling of not wanting to be a burden but the world is changing and a lot of people are trying to learn to be more understanding and supportive of people with disabilities. I see this in academia and at the workplace and also among discussions with friends. For me, if I am hanging out with a blind person at a restaurant I don't mind helping get to the sit, reading you the menu (I actually like discussing the menu), walking you to the restroom or getting a glass of water for you. Those are simple things that are more or less basic needs."
p0007,Accessing mental health care specifically related to my vision impairment (located in US),9,Blind,"Honestly I would say seeking out other blind and visually impaired people is way better than therapy from a pretty much guaranteed to be sighted therapist with no real idea what you're going through. And if you've already experienced abuse from the mental health sector, it's not worth rolling the dice on dealing with that again. I personally won't ever be going back to any therapy after the abuse that led to medically induced brain damage. 

Finding other blind folks to talk with, even just online, is so helpful. If you can get in touch with anyone from the National Federation of the Blind or read some of their literature on the power of blind people and our communities, I highly recommend it. There's lots of folks to talk to on the Our Blind Discord server as well.
Find your state's disability advocate/employment aid and discuss your mental health needs with them.

As an example, in Texas, it's known as Texas Workforce. My aide/advocate helped me get recommended into the Austin center's waiting list. There have been some disappointments with loss of communication and missed messages regarding O&M and tech, but that's been on me.

She did help me find a local support group of visually impaired folk to talk about troubles and generally bitch when things like power outages happen or the mute Domino's driver tries to wave a piza in my face so I'll take it...
Yeah- there are certainly lots of great blind/visually impaired folks in the community, and also, there are lots of great therapists. I have low vision and a sighted therapist and we spend probably 75% of our time over the last several years discussing vision-related stuff. I’ve also experienced plenty of issues with medical providers over the years and have my share of trust issues, but blanket statement bad mental health care isn’t a cause or a result. OP, if therapy is a good fit for your needs, good therapists exist."
p0008,New glasses!,15,Blind,"Thank you, I've spent all day stressing about going out tonight and what it might mean for my future. I'm not so worried about me but about other peoples reactions. I've had drs blame some very obvious problems on my mental health before like I was told my continence issues were unrelated to the organ falling outside my body. I'm worrying this will be another thing they choose to build into something it's not. I'm doing all this while at the same time knowing that it might not even be an issue, maybe these glasses have done the trick. But hopefully by the time I tuck myself into bed tonight I'll have the experience/information I need to decide what I need to do going forward. I just want to feel safe and have a reference point of where I am being that a sliver of curb or a drain cover catching the light or that be a cane telling me where the edge of the path is. In myself I don't really care as long as I can still go out when I need to. It's the worrying about other people that's getting to me at this stage."
p0009,"Career prospects for visually impaired, young stroke survivor ",8,Blind,"Oh, [Access To Work](https://phw.nhs.wales/services-and-teams/healthy-working-wales/workplace-guidance/employees-with-health-needs/musculoskeletal-health/guidance-and-resources-for-employers/access-to-work/#:~:text=Access%20to%20Work%20can%20help,practical%20support%20with%20your%20work) will probably pay for a screenreader like JAWS at the very least. I think you have to apply for it rather than your employer but they’ll suggest accessibility related tools and provide the money for it. Sorry if you have already gone down this route."
p0010,Anyone in here with ADHD or autism?,7,Blind,"I have diagnosed ADHD and dyslexia.    

We can make a discord channel under r/blind discord for mental health if you like.  Let me know.
Thank you so much for your feedback. I was diagnosed last year at the age of 36. So I know the feeling. 

I think you are on to something about the techniques working for blind people also benefit ADHD. Before getting my diagnosis, I spent a lot of time reorganizing my kitchen. Basically, made sure everything was within reach and in a good place. I bought kitchen equipment that was easy, fast and fun to use (air fryers and multi cookers) and it helped change my eating habits. 

I later realized that I was creating a very ADHD friendly kitchen too! I need to think carefully about how I can take that concept to the rest of my house (and workplace)"
p0011,Looking for a job,3,Blind,"first of all, are you here in the United States; if so, I might know a job that you could do from home, that does not take up a lot of time, and would be I believe a perfect fit for you. I work at this company, myself, and I know the ins and outs as to what is going on with the campaign that I’m working. And everyone here where I work are either low vision, or Blind. And we have a very very good community of people who help each other and are aware of each other’s needs in assistive technology, throughout the workplace. If you are very interested in this, please send me a private message and I can tell you more about it."
p0012,How is your mental health?,24,Blind,"I was born blind, premature by a number of months. The oxygen needed to keep my brain going was fatal to my retinas, and so I have had no useful vision all my life.

I was very lucky apart from that, though. Despite an apathetic set of parents who didn’t care to get involved with any blind adaptations or organisations and indeed who made it quite clear they didn’t intend to have me and it was my younger, sighted siblings who were the wanted children, I thrived as a child. I was well-supported in education, I made friends. Yes, I became one of the nerds, but the nerds were a group of their own. I didn’t need respect from the whole student body, I was used to not having it from my own parents, after all. I found my niche and settled in, and learning became my thing, backed by technology.

For a decade and a half, this worked well. I grew. I learned. I found ways of understanding things I couldn’t interpret. Proving the existence of clouds to my satisfaction meant a trip in a hot air balloon, because I couldn’t see them and other empirical tests – like covering the sun with another object – didn’t satisfy me. I was curious, polite, inquisitive and excited by the potentials offered by technology to improve my own lot in life, and happy to use my blindness as a teaching tool for others. It became a true part of me, rather than something apart from me. I embraced it. 

Mental health wasn’t on my RADAR at that point. My own health had never brought up any questions in that regard: I’d fallen out of trees and smashed my head on rocks, sprained things and pulled muscles, but nothing other than the physical. The first time I ever really felt that my blindness was a problem was a day when my sighted friends began to take off on their bikes, leaving me behind. I’d been involved in everything else up to that point, and standing outside school, hearing the tick tick tick of their bicycles fading into the distance was the first time I had a bitter upswelling of envy for those who could do what I couldn’t.

I went home. I dialed up to the online bulletin board systems and Multi-user dungeons I’d played for years and marauded my high-level characters through dangerous areas, the thrill of being good at something I’d worked hard for counterbalancing the emotions dredged up by being abandoned. After I’d cooled down, I realized that, for every trip they took out on their bikes, there’d still be more to the cinema, or shops, or bowling alley, just like all the other times. Cross-country biking was an extra to the things they did, not a replacement for the things we did.

My next real shock came when I moved from school to college. I’d had regular access to a sighted assistant up to this point: I’d not needed it often, particularly as I grew more confident in my own use of technology, and the fact that I was left alone by them much of the time served me well in bonding with my sighted peers. Still, the safety net of them being there, plus their ability to fight for accessible work or to adapt it ready for lessons, was a crutch I didn’t know I needed. The 2 years at college without such a level of support was grueling. Being handed print textbooks at the start of a lesson and told to use them like everyone else was … eye-openingly impossible, and began to make me realise just how ablest the word could be, although that word didn’t really enter my vocabulary at that point.

This pattern was to repeat itself throughout my life. For every one job interview I attended in hope, perhaps five or six people turned me away with legitimate-sounding reasons for not employing me, thinly veiling the fact that the real reason was my blindness. Legally, they couldn’t say it, but as a practical matter, if two people apply for the same job and one requires less adaptations or changes to existing working systems, most of the time, the disabled person loses.

Despite all this, I was resolute in my blind happiness. I’d known no different, after all. Seeing was a concept to me, not a way of life. I would have happily given away physical parts of my eyes to help other people see more clearly if medically feasible.  And then we had a child.

Another pivotal moment came during my child’s toddler days. She was an articulate child – she had to be, pointing at things and making noises didn’t get her anywhere. We walked into a fast-food restaurant during the school holidays. I remember vividly the flood of warm air as we crossed the threshold, the roar of noisy voices, the clangor of diners ordering and eating and playing, kids screaming, parents shouting. And us waiting to be seated in all that, and me knowing intellectually that my daughter was only a few small footsteps away from me yet utterly cut off, aurally, from my senses.   This was the point at which I really began to want vision. Getting on or off the right bus, knowing precisely if I was about to walk into the correct building or room, being assured of my place in line – these had all been things I’d previously struggled with whilst out-and-about with my child, where just a little bit of vision could have helped.  I’d grumbled a little about them internally, but accepted it as part of my life. And this entry into the furor of the restaurant tipped me into thinking that, even the smallest chance of some vision, medically, mechanically, computationally or however, would be something to jump at.

This burning desire has faded as my daughter has grown older. The more I’ve done with her, the more independent I have become and the more ability and understanding she has developed, the need has become less pressing. I was already very happy to use technology to aid me, and that’s only gotten better with time. When we left college as a couple, reading print letters required a flatbed scanner and desktop computer arrangement, taking up half our living room and minutes to read a sheet of paper. Now, I can flip through a handful of letters, point them at the camera poking out of my shirt pocket, and have them sorted by recipient before I’ve finished walking through my house. The ability to read handwriting came next, smashing the barrier of identifying who sent us Christmas cards and bringing a major upswing to my efficiency in the office (yes, my colleagues can now leave handwritten post-it notes on my desk). And just this week, we’ve sent our daughter off on a school trip and I am actually looking forward to the photos she’ll send back from her phone, because of the descriptive abilities of the large language models we now have access to. 

For me, blindness is an inextricable part of who I am. I work in the field of visual impairment. I play adapted sports. I read on a Braille display rather than an eInk kindle, although I am always careful to point out that the source material I read is now the same as everyone else’s, just on a different screen. This is a far cry from my own school days, when putting a book into Braille meant physical, mechanical  labour. Being a computer programmer has undeniably helped me through life – I’ve written dozens of tools for my own edification over the years.  And it is that comfort with and power of technology that I think is my mental life line. I am fortunate beyond my wildest imaginings as a teen. If You’d told my 16-year-old self that he would be able to access handwritten notes at work, or comprehend pictures from holiday snaps, he would have laughed at you. ‘No way’, I’d have said. ‘Blind people can’t access that sort of thing.’

I’d have been right, of course. But things change. And the pace of change has never been greater. And this is what keeps me going. The time I’d spend wallowing in misery would be time I could miss these potential breakthroughs. And so for every little niggle of inaccessibility, for every bump along the road, I think about the road ahead. If I can hop over that bump or smoothen out that wrinkle, what might lie over the horizon?  I could no more have predicted the things I can do now back then than I can predict what access I will have a decade from now. But I do know that, if I persist in living a happy and healthy life, engaged with the blind community, using my technological skills to help other people whilst earning a living and bringing up my child to appreciate that a disability isn’t a lack of ability in other areas, I can cope.

Times are hugely tough right now. My income hasn’t gone up, but the bills have. Just this month the mortgage has jumped up by nearly a third. Electricity, heating and food are also on the rise. None of it is blind related, but all of it impacts how much disposable income we have, and that is blindy – because the money we use on taxis and the extra costs of blindness has become squeezed. I guess we just have to remain careful and cautious, pick our way through the difficulties as best we can. But not lose sight of the fact that seeing is by no means necessary to live a happy, productive life in 2023 in this country, and that is something I am very grateful for.
I'm 41, and My mental health was great until I went totally blind 9 years ago, because as long as I had sight, and even though I only had 10% acuity, there were still things, like playing video-games and coding, that I could still do completely unhindered and where I could feel normal. I also led a fully independent life where my only annoyance was that my employer only let me work from home on Thursdays (this was 15 years before COVID made remote work more prevalent). Then I went blind and had a 5 year long dark period in which all I wanted was to die, and even went through a single psychotic break which ended up with me locked up in a psychiatric hospital for 3 weeks due to being considered a danger to myself. While I never actually tried to kill myself, because I was always afraid of surviving a suicide attempt and ending up with even more disabilities, if there was such a thing as a pill that I could take to end my life I would have taken it back then and would still take it right now. That said these days I try to make the best of the hand that life dealt me, and am eagerly yet patiently waiting for my natural or accidental death, or an opportunity to safely exit life.

What made me recover from the darkest times of my life was the realization that I could still code blind as well as the normalization of my current condition. I can still remember how great life was back then, and would love to return to those days, but for some reason, the more time passes, the more I tend to think of my former sighted days as dreams. Able and healthy people don't even realize how incredibly lucky they are, and to be honest I get a little infuriated with the fact that so many healthy people waste away their lifes with futility instead of investing into self development and into making the world a better place.
I’m 25. A lot of issues have been piling up over the last few weeks that affected my mental health mentally. A lot of these issues come from the visual impairment and I feel a little defeated
I’m 62 and was just recently diagnosed as legally blind. The disease is progressive and there’s nothing to be done. 

I already had mental health challenges. Now I am going through the five stages of grief as I lose my vision. I hate losing my independence. I’m hoping to find group therapy to talk to other people about this.

I’m sorry you’re struggling. I am too.
I’m 23 and recently lost a significant amount of vision due to a illness… My mental health is not good at all currently it happened six months ago and I’m still reeling from it. My life has been completely flipped upside down. I don’t know what to do there’s no resources where I live. I can’t drive anymore. I can’t do anything that I wanted to do or had planned to do with my life because of this and honestly Every day I wish that I never woke up… The only thing keeping me together is my family I guess… But everyone’s getting sick of me complaining and being depressed I’m sure I don’t even know what to do. I really hate it here… A piece of me is still holding out hope that something will change, but another part of me is like I need to be realistic and except this is the life I live… I DK how much longer I’m gonna be here, but I’m gonna hold on until I can’t any longer.
Well, I’d say my mental health is stable now, but I’ve had my ups and downs not only because of my blindness, but also because of my upbringing, and the fact that I have been moving from country to country beginning my teenage years, which has left me with no physical friends, and a bunch of good long-distance friends.  I am definitely successful academically, but the isolation that comes with blindness really sucks. Now  20 years old in college I have managed to come to terms with it by reading a lot and playing video games when accessible. Recently, after a long search, just found a quasi job and will use part of the money that I will be making there to travel around to meet up with my lomg-distance friends to see if I can find life a little more enjoyable lol
Mental health? In this economy?!
Wait you guys have good mental health
Who had a great metaphor bench, pressing mental health"
p0013,Dealing with paranoia while blind,14,Blind,"This is a tough one. I've got paranoia in large part because people do watch me when I'm out, they like seeing a blind person doing the thing. I think a big part of managing it is just knowing that you're prone to this kind of thinking and doing what you can within reason to be safe when you go out. Most people are not going to hurt you even if they are watching you, and it can be to your advantage that people are watching because if something does start to happen there are more witnesses to it. Keeping an eye on your mental health for the day is important too. I have days where I know I may not be able to go to some places because I'm just too keyed up. I do a lot of planning ahead too, but that's a general blind life thing; you kinda have to know where you're going and how you're going to get around at that place and then get home."
p0014,How To Help My Blind Friend,19,Blind,"Wow, sounds like you're an amazing and thoughtful friend and it's evident you really care about her well-being. With that said, you're exhausted because you're taking on the work of two people, and that's not fair or sustainable. Good for you for recognizing that things need to change so that you can maintain your friendship while making sure that one person isn't carrying the load for all the practical/logistics side of things. 

While some of what you've described does come down to a lack of blindness skills, I think the bigger issue is anxiety and a lack of confidence in her own abilities, so maybe that's the place to start. She knows how to use the machine to pay for things, but gets anxious and asks you to do it. She gets upset and anxious if you ignore her requests for help. She has an app for reading labels, but asks you to do it instead. All of these things are tasks she has demonstrated the capability to do, so it's not really about skill. You can teach her over and over and over again, but if her lack of knowledge isn't the problem, you're getting nowhere and becoming more and more frustrated in the process. 

Some of these things will be beyond your ability to address. While it's great that you're there for emotional support, calming her down and soothing her anxiety all the time is a different thing entirely. Working through this with a mental health professional will help her to get to the root of what's going on in her life and empower her to make changes. It won't be easy, but it will be so worth it. A therapist or other professional can talk through the things she's struggling with emotionally, plus they can determine if there's an imbalance that meds could help with. If nothing else, it can really help to have an outside perspective, because things have been this way for so long that it's difficult for her to even imagine how they could be different. 

Others have given some great suggestions about making sure she's connected with any blindness services she might need, like a training center or an o&m instructor. While that's happening, think about some small but significant things you both could do to change things in the household. The first step is to sit down and talk about things, at a point when you're both in a good headspace. She needs to know that you truly do love her, but things can't continue this way. She needs to know you believe in her, maybe more than she believes in herself right now. She may become upset or defensive, which in no way means you have done something wrong and should drop it. 

Once you've really got an open conversation going, you could start by making an agreement together on something small that you'll work on. An example might be her makeup. Let's say you've taught her, or she's learned from a tutorial, how to put on her lipstick. You could agree together that if she'd like you to do her makeup that day, she'll do the lipstick. If she's not feeling comfortable or confident enough when the time comes, you could be gently encouraging and supportive without actually stepping in to do all the makeup that day like you always have done before. If it turns out she doesn't wear any that day, no one is harmed and it's not the end of the world, but an important boundary has been established. 

I wish you both all the best in navigating this, and no matter what happens, please do take some time for yourself. You deserve it!
I have to agree. I'm not blind or considered visually impaired (joined the sub as have some vision loss that can't be corrected) so I can't speak from that perspective but have worked in mental health and with people with varying levels of vision. I have to agree that this sounds like a confidence or mental health thing. It sounds like she's feeling vulnerable or insecure so is asking for help with things she's capable of as a way of getting the reassurance she feels she needs to feel more safe and secure.

Once you've started helping someone in this way it can feel tricky to reset the boundaries but if it can be done in a way that demonstrates kindness and compassion I think that would be really helpful in promoting her confidence and create a healthier relationship for them both."
p0015,Can a blind person work as a dishwasher?,5,Blind,Universities have very high entry requirements and no workplace will take me if I'm self taught.
p0016,Why is the world so unforgiving?,49,Blind,"Uhm, wow; I'm not sure where to start. You're a senior in high school, correct? Where are your parent(s) / guardian(s) in all this? I'm not sure how things work where you live but do you have an IEP and a vision teacher (when I was growing up I had a teacher that came in and had a class where I learned braille, O&M, how to do things independently, etc). It sounds like you could use some adult help advocating for you with the school administration and your teacher. By all means you should also advocate for yourself but having other people in your corner is a good thing and you shouldn't be ashamed to ask people that care about you to get involved for you. Some teachers / people just suck and hopefully you get through her class and never have to have her teach you again.

..I can relate to a lot of what you said. Having aniridia, especially when i was younger and my vision was much better than it is now, my visual impairmenr/legal blindness was largely invisible to people, and in a way I never really fit in and was somewhere alone in between the sighted and non sighted worlds. Honestly it kinda fucking sucks and certainly didn't help my mental health lol.

Have you gotten the chance to meet other visually impaired and blind people your age? I remember going to summer camps that were just for those groups and it being fun and a good learning experience. I also got to go to space camp when I was little with other kids like me and it was really cool.

I feel you on the privileges thing, sighted people are way more privileged than they will ever realize or admit and a lot of people just suck and are ableist peices of shit. The number of people that can't drive for shit and don't know the right of way laws from their own ass makes my blood boil knowing that I know how to drive and can't yet these fuckers can and don't know how putting other peoples lives in danger because they don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves just pisses me off so much---anyways! Before I keep ranting lol.

I think that everyone learns differently and you just have to find the ways that work for you. You putting in the work is what matters and so long as you pass a certain grade isn't forever and won't hold you back in life--especially in college you'll find that some professors are easy graders, most are fair and follow the rubric, and some teachers are just impossible with their grading and expectations. You will get out of your degree what you put into it and the skills of how you do that are more important than what grade you get. What I'm trying to say is don't beat yourself up too much and try not to overstress. Try for great grades certainly but at the end of the day be kind to yourself.

I have seen some amazing people in this world and I don't think any career ambitions are necessarily out of the question simply because you are blind. I'm not sure what your career ambitions are but you should definitely do your research and try to connect with blind people that have been where you want to go. I think having examples and finding a mentor would be greatly beneficial to you. If you do have a vision itinerant or whatever they are called in your area definitely ask then for help finding a mentor, they have access to resources and can help you make connections / network.

Best of luck and don't give up. You need your right now.
I'm so sorry that this has happened to you.

None of this is your fault, and there is nothing lacking within yourself. People behave this way when they lack the ability to empathise, and/or refuse to educate themselves properly. As a teacher, they definitely ought to be doing so.

I do not think you are mentally unstable, I think you are a human being struggling with circumstances most cannot understand. School is hard enough without extra needs and challenges to overcome, but I do worry about the impact this could have on your mental health.

Is there someone you can trust and talk to? And does your school have any support for students with extra needs? Ideally there would be a way to report all of this and have it dealt with, but I am unsure about how the school system where you are operates.

For what it's worth you have talent, and you are capable of seeing the world very clearly (so to speak, I apologise). I hope that things improve for you!"
p0017,about to be 14 and starting to realise the negatives of my disability,31,Blind,I teach kids how to use canes for a living. I can’t imagine anyone using one for attention or anyone thinking you’d do that. If someone accuses you of doing that I would assume that they are seriously struggling with their mental health and that has more to do with them than you. So try not to worry about that too much. But I know it’s a big adjustment and just another thing to be self conscious about…My advice to you is to embrace it. Rock the cane! People will be jealous of your confidence. Anyone who gives you shit for it or makes you feel bad doesn’t deserve to be in your life. Hope this helps.
p0018,TO guide dog or not to guide dog.,7,Blind,"Do you mean emotional support animal as in one that goes with you everywhere?

Pets can definitely be good for mental health and emotions, whether that’s a dog, cat, or anything else. And I’m definitely not going to hate on someone who has a pet for the benefit of their mental health. 

The problem with emotional support animals is that there are no training standards. Someone can buy a vest online, and slap it on their ill-behaved pet, and take them places. And I’m talking dog that barks or lunges at other people, dog that poops inside, or dog that is otherwise disruptive. 

Understandably, business owners don’t want a dog in their establishment who is going to poop on the floor or jump up on other customers. And they may, not knowing the difference, assume guide dogs and other service dogs are equivalent, and refuse them service (even when they legally can’t). Thus, the poorly trained ESA makes it more difficult for trained service dog teams. 

As far as I’m concerned, if ESAs were trained to the same high standards of service dogs, I wouldn’t care about them. I don’t even really care if someone takes their well-trained pet with them. As long as the dog isn’t making a mess or being disruptive, it doesn’t bother me, whether they’re doing a specific job, or not. 

However, as long as there’s no training standard for emotional support animals, and people use it as an excuse to try and take their badly behaved pet with them, the whole thing is going to be a problem to guide dog handlers. 

BTW, I’m not a guide dog handler myself. I would like to get one in the future but don’t currently have a lifestyle where I would make good use of a dog.
No, I don’t want one that goes with me everywhere. A service dog that did travel with me on certain occasions would be a benefit, however that’s not something I want every day. I understand the repercussions of having a poorly trained E S A. That is why I want to go down the avenue of a service animal for mental health support rather than a dog guide.
Perhaps emotional support is not the word I'm looking for. There are dogs for mental health, and do bare in mind that laws in different places aren't the same as the US.
If I wanted a guide dog, I would have a guide dog. As I explained in my initial post, I don't always want to be traveling with the dog. There are days when I barely remember to take my house keys and all the other important stuff. If I can barely focus on myself and where I need to go, how can I also focus on keeping anyone else safe? People approaching me is something else I don't handle, hense not wanting a dog guide. If I'm going somewhere, I want to get from point A to Point B with was few distractions as possible.
Of course, your O&M skills have to be good to have a dog guide. I believe that my skills are sufficient enough and provide me enough independence that I don't require a dog. As I stated in a previous comment, there would be times more often than not where I would be doing the dogs work for them, making the job of the dog almost redundant.
If a mental health provider or other medical provider involved in your care writes you a letter stating you medically need the dog as part of your treatment plan, that ESA dog is protected the same way a service dog is, at least in the US. Look up FHA laws on Assistance Animals. Those cover SD, SDIT, and ESAs."
p0019,Seeking psychiatric help,13,Blind,"I've often said going blind is hard but being blind is easy.

Day to day life as a blind man has been way better than I expected but going through all the emotions and grieving that comes with the diagnosis was hell.

And nobody helped. Nobody explained the profound sense of loss I was about to experience. Nobody warned me how much it hurt to realize some of my dreams would never come true. Nobody told me about the jealousy and the anger and the depression in store.

All they told me was ""Call this number for a free white cane.""

It turns out most ophthalmologists don't understand the grief we go through. They aren't trained to deal with it and if we don't bring it up they don't bring it up, either.

It's a little messed up, isn't it? We're handed a life changing diagnosis and just assumed to take it in stride.

The truth is I'd be more worried about someone who didn't have a gut wrenching emotional reaction to learning they're going blind. Anybody who can lose their job and their driver's license and their hope for the future and NOT need a therapist to discuss the turning of their world upside down is scary.

Mental health counseling should be part of the diagnosis. It's unreasonable to expect us to not get messed up when we hear it. But it's not. We have to bring it up to our eye doctors to get a referral or we have to find a therapist ourselves.

I guess this is my way of saying I sympathize, I get it, and you're not alone.

There are counselors who specialize in disabilities and in grief. Hopefully someone in this thread recommends a good one in South Carolina to you,

In the meantime my DMs are always open and I'll link you to the blog posts where I write about figuring my own way through the grief and loss.
Others have addressed things well I just wanted to mention that you may be experiencing Charles Bonette Syndrome, a form of hallucinations created by the eye itself when vision is changing. It was first noticed in cataract patients but it can happen to anyone with enough vision loss. I have it and it took two retinal specialists to tell me what it was; it flares up worse when I'm sick or stressed. If the things you're seeing in the periphery of your vision are consistent, always in the same spot, and it's been going on for awhile, it may be Charles Bonett Syndrome, which isn't dangerous but it is annoying as hell heh. 

And I second what's been said elsewhere here. Going blind sucks hardcore, being blind isn't so bad once you get used to it. I think you may be eligible now for services like Medicaid and Social Security Income and if you can get on any of those you may have better help finding some mental health coverage.
It don’t have practical advice about your mental health question, except to say that I’ve found brief counseling sessions very helpful. With the state of our health care system, I think anyone seeking medical treatment would benefit from counseling support. Maybe look into a teledoc as a first step, if you have access.

I wanted to mention, though, that what you describe sounds somewhat like the visual aura that can accompany migraine in a couple of key ways:
- Visual aura often begin with the peripheral vision, and can be accompanied by other peripheral effects like tunnel vision.
- Mine typically progress to what I can only describe as flashy light worms that dance around my central vision.
- It’s fairly common for migraine sufferers to wake up with the symptoms. They can also be triggered by the whole long list of migraine triggers, from smells & foods to hormonal shifts, sleep deprivation, or stress.
- They aren’t always accompanied by migraine pain. I had weird (& upsetting) aural symptoms for a few years before ever experiencing my first migraine headache. They did, however, respond to migraine medication or sleep.

The Wikipedia article on Scintillating Scotoma has some reasonable artistic renderings of what they look like, although none of them are exactly what I see. Check it out and see if they look familiar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma"
p0020,Maybe a good community?,0,Blind,Certainly doesn't encourage openness; one of the most important parts of any mental health discussion.
p0021,Lost Eyesight Left Eye. Gap Quarter (Gap Year?),6,Blind,"I'm blind in my left eye, been that way since birth, and usually when i go out in public, i wear an eye patch and people usually don't really bring it up or say anything about it. So in regards to that, based off my own experiences, it shouldn't really be an issue. Though if like me, you end up using a white cane to help with ""seeing"" on your blind side and the lack of depth perception, expect people to be super awkward and weird about it and just always assume you have less sight than you actually do and people seem to always notice the cane and never notice the eye patch, at least in my experience. But if using a white cane helps you, don't let how others react to the cane discourage you, though I do realize that's significantly easier said than done. And if others are super weird and awkward about you using a white cane, getting a cane that's customized to be colors you like/to fit your aesthetic will help a lot in making other people less awkward and weird about it and in improving your confidence/willingness to use it. And again, I'm speaking from own experience of being a monocular my whole life, though i didn't start wearing an eye patch and using a cane till last year since my family refused to ever acknowledge and help me accommodate my disability. And I haven't gone to college yet so I can't speak on how adjusting to and attending college would be like with your disability, and I can't speak on how it might affect your mental health. And I also, obviously, can't really speak on the mental health impact of going from fully sighted to a monocular and how the adjustment to that might be like since I obviously never went through that adjustment period."
p0022,Do any other visually impaired people feel like they have some cognitive issues from over-tiredness?,16,Blind,"I've been on and off medication for mental health issues since I was 13, so I absolutely understand how you feel, at least to an extent one can. The other day I cried for 20 minutes because we got the wrong ice cream at the grocery store, which is not an appropriate reaction to ice cream. Please know you have the sympathy and emotional support of this internet stranger."
p0023,seeking braille fulltime.,10,Blind,"You can modify all screen readers to do things similarly to the Braillenote.  For example the students I teach who come from the Touch like to check their power with enter&p, their time with enter&t and so on. They're familiar commands that let them move to Windows or whatever with less of a jarring change.

Unfortunately a Braillenote won't get you terribly far in many workplaces. I'm afraid you do need to consider moving to some more mainstream tech.  For all the Braillenote is a neat idea, they are not a one-stop solution for life. Every app in KeySoft is so cut down as to make it useless for adults who need to lead fulfilling, productive, employed lives. The evidence for this is simple; they had to move from KeyWeb, a cut-down web browser, to something more mainstream to keep up.  
you can probably bury your head in the sand and pass at college or whatever because 1, people may feel you can't move to something new and, 2, they'll believe Humanware's marketing that the BrailleNote is a modern, powerful and all-in-one solution for productivity.  But I've never seen a respected colleague using one exclusively. Sure, some people use them for noettaking, some even check their emails now and then, and a very few people browse the web with them.  But everyone with whom I work as an adult who is blind can also use an iPad, or a phone, or a computer of some sort to do the things where the Braillenote falls down. 
With a Braillenote, you won't be able to collaborate with sighted colleagues on a presentation or a document in real time.  You won't be able to access the vast majority of online training materials an employer might require you to undertake. You'll struggle to react to suggestions from colleagues on your own documents or to track changes and make comments or suggestions in theirs. You'll find almost any online platform - for timesheets, tech support tickets, live chat, knowledge-base work or any number of other things difficult and, unless you're going to lug around a computer monitor, nobody's going to see what you're doing as you do it or work side-by-side with you on something.

I'm not saying give up Braille by any means, but learn to use it with hardware that the rest of the world uses too. That way, if your phone or computer dies, you can connect your Braille to another one.  If there's a necessary upgrade or change, everyone else will be going through it too. And if the Braille device itself dies, you can rely temporarily on using Braille Screen input, or 6key entry on a qwerty keyboard. So many more options if you untie yourself from Humanwares handholding, expensive, underpowered, inefficient and dumbed-down system.
Perhaps we just see things. Differently.
I’m no voc rehab teacher or anything, but you’re going to need JAWS to be successful in college and in the workplace. I would recommend having a laptop with JAWS and a Braille display so you still have tactile feedback. You may need further training to use the computer if you’re not used to it. If you can get a Braille display funded, I would go for one that’s a hybrid like the Brailliant, because I assume you’re quicker at typing with a Perkins keyboard rather than a computer keyboard and if that’s the case, that’ll be really beneficial during lectures.
I don't see what's wrong with humanware system



Maybe it's because I've been raised on it but I kind of love the way the humanware devices work and none of the other screen readers have the three metal buttons that the brown notes have which are the most convenient things ever when paired with a thumb keys and everything I can navigate it so quickly



You brought up key web and how that's proof that they don't advance but I think it's proof they do advance because they did switch over to Chrome and a whole bunch of other things and it works really good on Chrome I've used it so they can catch up and keep up with other technology



What is it exactly that would leave me out of most workplaces honestly someone mentioned the example of needing to play a disc or something but I don't think most workplace is used those



And I'm not really looking for a job in corporate America anyway as I'd rather do something more creative



Besides there's workplace life and then there's personal life isn't there



I could still use one for my all my personal everything and maybe have a backup that I could use for a workplace job if I really needed one




And I'm sure I could work around jobs that would make it completely non-viable I already will have to ask for accommodations anyway  lots of people don't take jobs where they have to do something they aren't comfortable with


There's a whole wide world out there I'm sure I could work with something 


There's got to be something out there I can do
The Braille Note touch plus has full internet connectivity

It can access pretty much any app my phone can

I'm sorry I thought I was facing I guess I forgot to press the line twice every time most Reddit posts seem to have everything they write in spaced out when my reader reads them

As for job it's not about John specifically it's about the idea of a computer without any access to Braille

I can do some basic job enough that I can use the computer and probably an emergency if I need to but I don't want it to be my main device for the rest of my life

Especially not for anything important I might want to do they say I might not be able to use the device I want for every job but ... Well the field I want to go in I I probably be a better writer if I could use braille and not a computer that made me uncomfortable so if I want to be a writer Braille would be more beneficial than a computer
And if I want to be a voice actor which is another career path I've been considering since people have scared me into not wanting to write anymore I don't see how a computer would change me being able to record myself I could do that just if easily on the Braille device

It's hardly a slate and chisel as mentioned it connects to the internet and runs every other app just fine it's not as if I'm deciding I'd rather run on a Perkins or even a mountbatten or even an apex or even a braille Note touch all of which are somewhat outdated 

The brown Note touch Plus is a perfectly usable modern device that they don't want to give me because and I swear I'm not making this up

I won't be able to change the font on PowerPoints I'll need to do for college presentations

At least that was the argument the use for switching me to job mid-school year

Just about the only important thing that that device wouldn't be able to do we have to place a phone call and I do have a phone for that

Anything else it wouldn't be able to do probably isn't important to my day-to-day life

And therefore for the personal device I want to live the rest of my life using I don't see why I couldn't use this one other than the fact that the provider won't give me one because they say it won't be useful for as you said every possible job

I guess this resource is very specifically about getting a job but I thought part of it was also about living independently which this would apply to

And I could look for jobs I could do with it

If a blind person I'm already used to be idea that there are certain jobs I won't be able to do because of me being blind and me using advice that couldn't do a certain thing I'll just add to the list of reasons why I couldn't do a certain job

But you'd think if they weren't going to let people use these devices they wouldn't actually provide them and raise kids on them their entire lives

I need to have a physical connection with my words in order to write and feel comfortable with it audio only doesn't really work with me even now I'm using my microphone on my phone to dictate what I'm saying and I'm worried that it's not working because it has a history of sucking but going back to edit it would be a pain I'd have to go line by line word by word character by character with individual little swipes if I was using Braille I probably could have written and posted this comment minutes ago I'm much faster at it it's more convenient it works better and I feel more comfortable with it and safer it

If I was stuck on a computer for the rest of my life it would pretty much destroy my sense of Independence and make every interaction with technology uncomfortable which isn't what I want for the rest of my life

I know it's pathetic but yeah the specific devices actually important to my mental health it always gets worse on summer break when I have to use my phone and don't have access to Braille

Call me a dinosaur if you'd like but I do think that device is relatively modern and in fact I'm pretty sure it's a lot newer than Windows computers or the Jaws program
I did use double lines


And there's plenty they can do


I've been on one for years trust me there's a lot you can do with them if you know how to use them correctly plus they might have changed it a bit since whenever you did did it since they do adapt




And there's a difference between learning to adapt and completely changing your entire system for no real reason



And personal preference and mental health aren't just excuses I mean it's so much more than that 


If the position was reversed and they you were told you could only ever use a braille note and couldn't use a computer you wouldn't be thrilled is that just a preference or would you learn to adapt



It's one thing if there's a reason to adapt like I said I've gone through about five different stages of device through my lifetime


But it's another thing to switch all together notice those five different devices I'll use a Perkins keyboard all you similar systems all you similar operating


Lord adapt means to alter something to fit a new environment not to throw away everything for something completely new that has nothing to do with anything else and no connection to the previous anything whatsoever that's more than adapting


Looks like expecting someone to go straight from a landline to a smartphone without something in between or sometime to get the hang of it



What is it exactly that you think this device can't do that's so important that I need to change everything to get it instead



Cuz it can access the internet and work with a good amount of speed it can send emails it can access any app on the Android play store and it has a really good keyword editor that allows me to save and monitor and access all my files that I have on my flash drive
It has Braille and an accessible and easy to learn system with the thumb keys and the cursor routing keys and the e chords and everything else that another device from another system wouldn't know wouldn't have
It's faster and more convenient and doesn't have a slow robot voice
It has a neat screen under the keys that a fighter person could look at or that you could use touch Braille with if you needed to so it wouldn't cut you off from any sighted people
It can connect to a large monitor if absolutely necessary if the screen is too small
you can use apps like Google sheets for when you need to make PowerPoints although I admit it not great with PDF but a PDF is kind of recited people anyway and I can just get it changed to a keyword document if I need the information
It can download attachment from emails easily
It comes with a neat book reader and you can install any others that you want to get a hold of
You can turn speech on and off and still use braille if you don't want there to be any sound so you're not locked to audio only and you can actually multitask and listen to music or something while writing which with any device that wouldn't let you use braille you wouldn't be able to do because you'd have to have the audio
It provides fast neat and convenient editing you can move through lines quickly or jump straight to whatever word you're looking for pop the cursive around wherever you need to and don't have to swipe character by character up and down with a fingernail or by pressing the arrow keys
I could go on but seriously what is it lacking but so important that means it's a device I can never use for the rest of my life?


what is it about the life-eyed lead that would be so impossible that I have to change and get a computer that give me anxiety


Please I'm very curious to know if these people who say I'm living in the past have a legitimate argument or not because so far I haven't heard one that actually made sense


And if you had brio you could probably read at a different pace and not have to deal with your screen reader apparently not being able to read spaced out lines maybe something's wrong with your screen reader because I am using double lines as you requested seems like your screen reader is not great

But go on please tell me why your screen reader is better than being able to read what's on screen so you can tell where the punctuation is and how the words are spelled and which words are being used

I'm very curious and would love to know since I haven't found any major problems in my life that I think I need to fix and so far there's nothing really big missing from it other than the fact that some fighting things I can't do like look at pictures and play video games but I don't think that's something that can be solved by changing devices
It's not childish


I don't like my mom then anytime you get sick or upset I'm just making it up in my head


Okay I'm not making up the fact that whenever I have to use the computer I start getting nervous and my chest hurts tightening and I breathe faster



Huge screen gives me trust issues before anyone's even near me



I'm not making up the fact that I'm faster trail or feel safer with a braillenote


Just because I know my limits and I've considered them and I'm going to try and work around them like how any disabled person works around any form of their disability doesn't mean I'm being childish


Or is it childish truth refused to get surgery to get their your eyesight back rather than staying blind


Should we all just get cured and change our entire life because I'd be more convenient for everybody else right


Control no one's going to hire a blind truck driver so if you want that job you better go get eyesight back


And if that's not the job you want for your life that doesn't matter you should do it anyway



Do you hear how dumb that sounds



This is the same thing okay



It's not being childish to take the few steps necessary to preserve some of my mental health when I'm definitely not going to be getting therapy because it's too expensive and probably won't do anything anyway


But instead I can work on it myself and try to take the stuff to necessary to make sure I'm actually happy



I can work with or around what I need to I've been doing that my entire life


Why should I stop now


I'm not going to become excited even though my mom wants me to is that also being childish and refusing to change cuz she thinks my life would be better if I could see


Send how many people are upset by the mere concept of forcing someone to have their disabilities erased even in fiction for some reason I doubt that


So how about we stop shoving mental health aside like it doesn't matter and treat it like it's just as valid as the any physical disability


Thanks
This is a sighted world. How a document looks makes it easier to read which is very important in the workplace. Actually, it’s very important everywhere. I hear your various arguments but the bottom line is if you’re planning on being a successful adult you are going to have to make some changes. It is not easy learning things that we have no interest in but, if you’re planning on joining the workforce , knowing JAWS is a necessary step to getting a decent job in an office environment for most visually impaired people. You don’t have to do it. But don’t expect the world to adjust to your stubbornness. We all like to use the devices we like to use, but if circumstances call for us to change we have to adapt.

p0024,"Inspired by u/brb_28 I need to leave my country I think, but I have no qualifications?",3,Blind,"Oh, wow, I am so sorry that you are struggling with mental health right now, and I am so sorry your family thinks so little of you and your abilities. 

You said you lived in the UK for four years before? I’m not sure what passport you hold because some are stronger than others, but were you on a student visa? I only ask because sometimes when it comes to trying to get to “indefinite to remain” or “permanent resident” type visas, the time accrued under a student visa doesn’t count toward your “time in” if that makes sense.

Obviously I am not super knowledgeable on this matter. I do agree with u/bradley22 that going for a month and trying to talk to someone there would be a great place to start."
p0025,Eight years of total blindness and I'm yet to find a reason to live,50,Blind,"Well if I have ADHD, it hasn't been diagnosed yet, and I've been through a lot of mental health specialists during the last 8 years.  I've also Googled ADHD and at least the description in the featured snippet doesn't sound like me at all.  I'm not impulsive, don't struggle with paying attention, attempt to predict the outcome of all my actions, and am not very energetic.  The reason why I used to play games was twofold: I liked to immerse myself in another reality and be the hero in single-player games and I liked to help others achieve their objectives in cooperative multi-player games.

As for my motivation, I lose it because I can't perform as well as I like.  For example I just bought another Raspberry Pi along with its official touchscreen despite being totally blind because I want to play around with computer graphics on Linux and want to dedicate my first Pi to serve content on the Internet, however I will most likely get demotivated once the project for which I bought it is near completion because little things that I cannot pay attention to due to being blind will affect the final experience and I will only learn about them too late.  I've been through this before, but keep acting like I still have sight or this time it will be different.

I'm a creative person, and attention to detail used to characterize me.  My goal in life used to be to provide memorable experiences that people could feel unconsciously even if they couldn't appreciate.  I feel good not when people compliment me but rather when they try the same kind of product made by someone else and complain about things they hadn't even thought about while using my creations, and to that end I don't mind to put more effort into making things than most would, but I also expect quality as a result.  The problem is that right now my extra effort is only compensating for my disability, and in addition I think I've reached a plateau from which I cannot progress no matter how hard I work."
p0026,how did you make the decision to get/not to get hearing aids as an adult? (mini vent),4,deaf,"I have been HoH my whole life (28F) and got hearing aids two years ago. It did change my life. For a long time, I just didn’t think I “needed” them. But it was very isolating and anxiety-inducing being left out of conversations at home and in public, not to mention how exhausting it was to try and keep up with conversations I couldn’t hear. There’s also a lot of research on HAs and brain health (minimizes risk of dementia), so that alone is a big factor for me too since my hearing is progressively getting worse. 

As for the internalized ableism, your family, and the stubbornness: I’m sorry your family hasn’t been supportive of your other disabilities. I had to learn how to be my own advocate over the years. I feel that I am still learning too. After I got HAs, I followed a bunch of Deaf advocates online. You can have HAs and still continue learning ASL.They have really nice ones that are very discreet. I work with children and families as a mental health therapist, and almost all of my families have never noticed my HAs.

Good luck to you ❣️
My mom is the only family I’m connected to, I’m estranged from my dad (who raised me), my sisters, and his entire side of the family for various reasons. There was a period of time where I was no contact with my mom but for the past year and a half we’ve been trying to rebuild our relationship. I feel like I can’t get her to work on all of the issues at once (queerness, gender, class, disability) so I’m taking it one step at a time. I have boundaries for my mental health’s sake, but it is hard to know when to continue holding on to a relationship if it’s holding me back from doing things that are positive for me.

I’m definitely going to bring this up in therapy, would love to find someone who is well versed in navigating this experience but right now I’m still “shopping” around for therapists so we’ll see."

p0028,Deaf peer helper around the world,7,deaf,"Yes I do understand that's how it is all over the world. There is absolutely no tendency to include all deaf people under one umbrella here. If anything, I see a lot of Deaf (I play deaf sports so I know a lot of Deaf people) vehemently against HAs and CIs because somehow they are threatened by them. A Deaf friend once told me he did not 'let' his wife go for HAs because... Anyway that's how it is here and I feel uncomfortable about people advocating on whether one should get CIs or not, unless they are ENTs.

On the livelihood part - the government does a lot actually. We have so many schemes that let's someone take loans for bare minimum interest to set up their own businesses. We don't have anything for housing though.

Mental health in general is not taken seriously here :) we all just wing it or get married and have babies. So I don't think the government does anything for it. 

Private organisations on the other hand does have a few things in place. But they are only for their own employees.

For most companies based out of India, making the workplace inclusive is all about making it inclusive as long as it doesn't cost them anything extra."
p0029,Husband going deaf,11,deaf,"ASL classes are definitely a good move, not only will he learn a new way to communicate but he will also meet fellow deaf/HoH people. One thing that tends to worsen mental health in late-deafened people is isolation, so getting out of the house and interacting with people on a regular basis can make a difference.
I started losing my hearing in high school and I am now 35 with severe hearing loss in my right ear and profound hearing loss in my left ear, coming to terms with having to live life without one of your senses is a big adjustement but it's nothing that can't be overcome with patience and support, and as it seems your husband is lucky enough to have a supportive spouse.
As far as other resources are concerned, I would recommend downloading LiveTranscribe apps and maybe Lingvano (which is Duolingo but for ASL) in order to start with signing before he starts studying the language in depth during his classes.

Good luck to both of you."
p0030,How to cope with a difficult job while being Deaf,5,deaf,"Does your job or insurance offer counseling, Employee Assistance Program, or mental health services? I would reach out to them for assistance.
I don't mean to disregard your desires here. But if staying there is causing so many issues, I would rather walk away with my mental health intact, than to suffer just to ""win"". Stress and other impacts can lead to lifelong issues.

I've had two cases go through the EEOC, and both times the final determination was that no discrimination happened (even though there was lots of documentation). I don't know the specifics of your situation, but I know I held on for much longer than I should have. If I could go back, I would have walked away much earlier. I'm in a much better place now.

Quitting will be YOUR decision that they have no control over."
p0031,Do mental hospitals allow hearing aids/BAHAs,24,deaf,"I did a bout of inpatient in high school, and I still wore hearing aids at that age. I can confirm that they WILL let you keep them. It's medically necessary both for your physical AND mental health. Taking it from you would only add more anguish to the situation, which would not even be conducive to helping you in a critical moment like this."
p0032,Mental Health Question,7,deaf,Maybe talk with Deaf Wellness Center.  It's in Rochester and they have Deaf therapists and resources for mental health for deaf people.
p0033,rant about this community,61,deaf,"I'm so sorry you received so much negative energy.  I missed your first post, so I'm not up to speed. 

It sounds like you need immediate help in the workplace.  A CI isn't going to be immediate help.  But CART can be!!!

I had a similar experience in college and I dropped out because of it.  Years later, I decided to take a chance and the school disability office introduced me to CART. It changed my life.  I honestly never world have made it through college (let alone been on the Dean's list or getting a graduate degree)  if it hasn't been for this.

 CART is basically someone typing out every single word that is being said during trainings. And the best part is that you don't have to worry about taking notes! The whole transcript is emailed to you afterwards.  This allows you to focus solely on listening instead of taking notes but if you miss hearing a word, you just look at the computer screen, and you are all caught up.  Your brain can focus on what it is leaning rather than focus on understanding words.  

This is considered a reasonable accommodation under the ADA in America.  Your company's cannot argue about trade secrets or anything to refuse providing this. 

This may be something you use your whole life or out may be something to help bridge the gap between now and when you have adapted to your CI (which can take months and exhausts you).

Now that being said.  I had my CI surgery on my 30s. I love it but there are still some downsides.  Group conversations and nose encircled are easier but it's not perfect.  In many ways, you'll still rely on old habits because they are so ingrained.   Getting my CI did make me more comfortable and accepting of being deaf. It helped me advocate for myself, and it made coworkers really understand just how deaf I am.  I became more confident in demanding others do their share of the communication burden.   That may or may not be what happens for you.  I still use oral speech as my primary communication tool.  A CI is a tool to help you reach your goals. Nobody can tell you what your communicating goals are and who you have to be.
* Are you able to get a CART service at your college if you are still in college? The CART service made a huge difference on my end. I always had ASL interpreters in my college classes, but it did not help me because I had to focus on the interpreters. I didn't have time to translate from ASL to English. So, I couldn't write down any notes at all. The CART service exceeded my note taking needs. 
* Please let your professor know the benefits of wearing a microphone / transmitter. Hopefully, he will change his mind. 
* As for the internship, were you able to get your retraining at this time with your accommodation needs being fulfilled? How long are you staying at this internship? Are you getting paid at this internship? 
   * If yes, you are entitled to reasonable accommodations at internships and jobs in order to thrive in this workplace. There is no way for employers to decline your reasonable accommodations. Please don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. 
      * Please make a list of your reasonable accommodations in a professional manner and email the HR department (copy this email to your personal email address too). Work email addresses can be deleted permanently. So, you could have enough paper trails for future lawsuits, in case they turn down your reasonable accommodations. 
* Getting CIs is up to you. It's all about you. It's your decision. It will be part of your life permanently. You just need to ensure that you will not have any regrets in the end. I'm Deaf and ineligible for getting CIs. I have a couple of friends who have CIs. They say both good and bad things about having the CIs. 
   * Cons 
      * CIs giving static background (They can be corrected by your audiologist specialized in CIs) 
      * Hearing fatigue (You can just release your transmitter from your head whenever you take a break) 
      * CIs failed, they were not functioning at all (You can just see your audiologist to fix this issue. If your audiologist recommends removing CIs, you would spend money again for the surgery) 
      * Insurance might not cover the CI costs (Keep looking for different insurances until you find one) 
   * Pros
      * Able to hear sounds that you never heard when you wore hearing aids
      * Able to listen to music if you are a big fan of music (connect via bluetooth)
      * Able to swim with CIs (Hearing aids don't work in water if it stays submerged too long)
      * Able to hear your voice better when you speak. Adjust your voice.

When you turn off your CIs, you are still deaf, right? I treat CIs as one of the most effective communication tools for people with hearing loss. 

I wish all the best to you!"
p0034,How do I deal with loosing my hearing?,11,deaf,"Hey op the other comment left here is super negative and I’m sorry that person feels that way but it is not the outlook that you also have to have if you don’t want to. Totally normal and okay to have a lot of big and negative emotions about your hearing but it doesn’t have to be so black and white like the other comment made it seem. I’m not going to say suddenly losing your hearing at a young age is easy. I suddenly lost a good chunk in one ear when I was 8 and it has progressed slowly until that ear has lost all hearing, im now 22. There are things that I face due to my deafness sometimes that will make me sad but over time those have become less as I’ve learned about how to accomodate and the things I can’t do anything about I’m getting better at just accepting. Because not everyone can do everything, we all have limitations that we have to accept. And having a good support system is helpful because a good support system is the type to learn sign language with you or find other ways to still communicate with you as you lose hearing, they don’t allow you to just get completely left out. Having a good support system means having people that may not understand but that you can vent to, and connecting to your local deaf community can give you both of those things. Having a good support system means having one that believes you when you say you didn’t hear them and makes adjustments to help you. I think it may be easy for some to say that a good support system does nothing because they’ve never had a bad one and don’t know how much that would have worsened their situation. It’s more common than not for families to not even attempt to learn sign language for their deaf family member. It’s also super common for deaf kids to have been told they were faking and not received any accommodation as a result. People who have healthy support systems are lucky even if they don’t realize it. Eta: obviously based on what you shared you are experiencing both. Your parents aren’t being the best support system currently and are adding to your feelings. Have you tried talking to them directly about it though? Maybe things are being misinterpreted or maybe they need to be talked to to even understand the struggles that come with losing your hearing. And you also have your good support system that’s there for you but you struggle to depend on. Also normal. The more you can accommodate yourself the better it often is for your mental health and it’s also good to remind yourself that everyone needs help with things sometimes. 

I’m not going to pretend being deaf isn’t a disability though. It does disable you from interacting with the world without at least some accommodation. That does make life hard. I’m not downplaying that. I’m just saying that it doesn’t have to be the end of your life being happy or good. Life can still be beautiful and happy without your hearing. It’s of course a big adjustment and doesn’t feel fair and it’s normal for it to be a lot to process but it’s possible to make the adjustment and live a good life. It’s normal to have anxiety or even panic at the loss of a sense and it’s possible to work through the emotions and find comfort in your other senses.
I'm 57.  I've been HoH since I was 7 years old and wearing hearing aids.  I'm profoundly deaf now as speech comprehension is greatly diminished and retired.  

First of all, don't beat yourself up.  It's not your fault.  You aren't a liability.  

I can relate to your anxiety of losing your hearing.  It's frightening and you feel very alone.  
Believe me, things will get better.  A lot better.  It helps to have local support and I would  
encourage you to attempt to make friends with others who are HoH / deaf.  

If you have an iPhone, I use Group Transcribe that turns speech to text.  It's quite useful  
in noisy environments where hearing aids are pretty much useless.  It's very good at  
picking up conversations.

Also keep your mental health in check.  Depression will over-take you if you wallow in  
your despair.  I had to start taking anti-depressants once I went profoundly deaf and  
had to quit my career that I loved.  It's important to keep those dark thoughts away.  
Don't give up.  

My hearing aids are bluetooth and I can stream all phone calls and music directly into  
my hearing aid.  This alone has been a life saver for me.  Also, if you want to feel the   
music -- look into SkullCandy's Crusher EVO headset.  It has haptics so there's no   
damage to your ears, but the bass will rattle your skull and you'll love it.  

Yeah, it sucks, but you'll be fine.  Lots of people out there with some type of disability,  
so you're not alone.  The advancements in finding a cure for deafness is improving, so  
keep your fingers crossed.

Stay strong.
are you able to wear the headphones over your hearing aids??? the haptics alone sound interesting so i definitely would love to give them a try.

I agree with keeping your mental health in check.. for years I could get by normally with my limited hearing until the day came where i couldn't. When you realize you can't go about your life the same as you once did, it's a hard adjustment.

**OP, keep your head up and make peace with this new normal. Lean on this community and know that you're not alone.** I'm sorry about your parents, just chuck it up to ignorance. They can't comprehend your experience without having lived it. Just focus on looking forward. It takes time for your brain to adjust to all the sound coming from your hearing aid, but if you feel that some things are too loud that's definitely worth talking to your audiologist about, they can adjust everything to a reasonable level. Once you start feeling comfortable with your hearing aids, concerts shouldn't be an issue although I'd think about getting some hearing protection of some kind (i read eargasm is a good brand for that)."
p0035,Advice needed - is being exhausted from listening normal?,52,deaf,"It really is. A lot of people don’t realize how much work it takes just to seem “normal” in the hearing world without an interpreter or communication accessibility.

This situation happens nearly every time I go out: Hearing person starts talking, I quickly interrupt and let them know that I’m deaf and can read their lips. They either start yelling at me because they think louder means comprehension (when it just messes up lip movement and makes it even harder to read them), or they give me a pity party: “I’m so sorry…”

I deal with it by basically staying within my circle of family and friends that I can communicate with via sign. I’ve turned down a lot of invites to go clubbing, parties, any social event if there will be more than two or three hearing people due to how exhausting it gets to follow the conversation.

You’ll just stress yourself out if you keep dwelling on how it makes you feel. Find an outlet that allows you to feel included and involved, not as easy to do as it is to type that, but that’s a method that’s helped me a lot.

I’ve been Deaf for 40 years now, and I’m still finding stuff out on how to deal with situations or people and how it affects my mental health. If it’s causing you that much emotional turmoil, then I would recommend going to a therapist/counselor to vent to so you aren’t carrying that burden around all the time."
p0036,Anyone want a friend to video chat with?,5,deaf,"Hi! I am in my early 30s and a mental health counseling grad student. I would be open to video chatting if we have some interests or things to talk about in common :) 

Also, there are still some active ASL Zoom Chats out there. The nice thing about Zoom is that you can join ASL Chats hosted by ppl in other states."
p0037,"Are Deaf people supposed to just... not have mental health issues? (half vent, half ""please help me"")",40,deaf,"Yeah, see, THAT to me, is the greater problem. You NEED a GREAT internet connection. Is there any way to access better Internet? 
 It would be impossible for me to survive without the internet. With the internet, it doesn't matter if I'm Deaf, and it doesn't matter if the other party is hearing and speaks. Google Live Captioning is a GAME CHANGER and has transformed my life. I cannot tell you enough how wonderful it's been for me, also a long time consumer of mental health services. Through Google Love Captioning I'm able to participate in tele-health AND Group therapy as well as a hearing prison, and better than I could IRL and F2F, this includes twelve step groups, as well."
p0038,Does anybody know how I can find a therapist that I can communicate with?,21,deaf,"Definitely talk to your deaf services agency.  In my state,  we have a particular mental health group that is contracted for all Deaf mental health services in the state.  But you may not see that of you just search for asl therapists.  

If you go the VRI route,  you'll need to ask about licensing in your state and if insurance will cover it."
p0039,"The older I get, the more I realize Hearing people are the ones disabled and not the Deaf people.",0,deaf,"I agree with your usage of the German word behinderung, ""being obstacled (sic)"". However, you are directing it in the wrong direction. Hearing people are the one suffering from behinderung, that is, via creating policies, procedures, laws, medical models, and many other environmental harms that causes normal Deaf children to become literally cognitively and/or psychologically disabled from linguistic deprivation and/or educational deprivations. 

Don't believe me? Here is a simple snapshot of a disabling world Hearing people created against the Deaf people: 

Google Scholar - [Deaf mental health language deprivation](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C24&q=deaf+mental+health+language+deprivation&oq=Deaf+linguistic+deprivation) 

It is the Hearing populations failure to understand the world in a proper way that causes no harm that makes them disabled and we need to assist them with their disability. One way is by creating threads like this to address it, especially addressing misconceptions such as yours. 

Example: 

1. If Hearing people get bored because of no sounds while driving, then they have been taught poorly on how to drive properly and how to keep themselves properly simulated via environmentally appropriate coping skills that doesn't rely on sounds. That's not the Deaf people's fault but solely on the shoulders of the Hearing world. Even ASL interpreters (mostly CODAs) agrees with this perspective, thus adding weights that even a Hearing person can correct the problems by using Deaf visual solutions. 
2. ""Bigger screens"" = more problems? It actually led to less problems because the screen is big enough to quickly glance at it to grab more information before looking back on the road. The smaller screens were causing a lot of problems, hence the change to bigger screens. Do your research first before making strange claims. 
3. Do you know why I ""generalized""? Because I cannot write a whole thesis on a Reddit page. I expect educated people to understand why I generalized by being able to extrapolate prior point of views and use creative thinking and abstract reasoning abilities to obtain new thoughts and ideas. If you had to accuse me of generalized statements, that only goes to prove that you cannot broaden your own horizon by your own efforts, thus defending your own status quo by making accusations towards people like me who CAN create those kinds of broad ways of thinking. 
4. In fact, here is an example of being able to extrapolate. Is the fact that you socialize with people that can think on a broader horizon because you're unable to do it on your own and need to depend on others to do it for you? 

Those are simply food for thoughts. I can easily serve a whole meal course full of scholar information but I don't want to do the dirty work for lazy people, regardless on if they're Deaf or Hearing."
p0040,Hearing therapist who wants to provide services to deaf people,2,deaf,"Yes Deaf Community need more mental health therpaist, first of all if you dont know sign language start taking classes you will need to be fluent in sign language first before you can provide your service to Deaf Community otherwise the therpay processing wouldnt be effective. It would be more effective if you are fluent in Sign Language. Not just Sign language you need to be also very familiar and understand Deaf Culture too
Not in the US but yes we took my daughter to a play therapist who knew BSL. I think everyone should have proper access to mental health services."
p0041,tips on improving accessibility and inclusion,6,deaf,"If this hasn’t happened already, I would suggest training for everyone on Language Deprivation and its effects on mental and physical health in the Deaf community. Our local deaf mental health  institution contacts me and others in my circle several times a year asking for advice in working with their clients who have “low language competence”. I would also suggest having ASL fluent staff (preferably Deaf) who specialize in working with clients who are Language Deprived."
p0042,Question about mental health support for the deaf community,10,deaf,signed by stories on youtube has videos of deaf people sharing their mental health experiences. would recommend checking it out to gain some perspective
p0043,Mental health counseling student looking to improve counseling services for Deaf/ HOH Clients,10,deaf,"My experience is rather limited, as I intended to start therapy again right before pandemic hit, and my experience are from the times I was severely depressed, so it didn't really cover a lot of my life.

But... what I can say is that I have noticed that not only professionals aren't aware (or understand) the Deaf cultura, they also aren't aware of how much society can be ableist and how that can compound with other mental health issues and identities, as well, not understanding how capitalism is extremely oppressive and problematic for disabled people (not only deaf/Deaf/HoH), or even how society can teach us a lot of subtle messages in ways that a non disabled person doesn't even realize. And of course, they tend to not be aware of any disability history.

Many professionals are like ""oh yeah, but that doesn't really have any relation to..."", being extremely dismissive, as if we can just turn off our disability in our daily life and not be affected by it or as if our disability is just a minor detail that can't be connected to everything or anything at all.

I remember when I started looking for psychologist, one of my criteria was understanding how my HoH identity can tangle with other identities (such as being queer and non binary, as well asexual) and struggles and possible mental health diagnosis. For example, I have a couple of suspicions that I might be on the spectrum, however, when doing some tests, a lot of it feels familiar, but I don't know if those experience and feelings can be 100% due to my hearing loss (and all the consequences plus a lot of how society treat me) or if it's a mixed bag and so on. (Not sure if that made sense, let me know and I'll try to find a better way to explain, as English isn't my native language).

And to be honest, I didn't get far with that criteria. It's easy to find professionals that can understand how racism is deeply tangled with other stuff or even how LGBT+ identities can be tangled with other stuff, but it's extremely rare to find someone with minimal knowledge of not only the culture, but as well the disability history, and all the subtleties of the disabled/Deaf/deaf/HoH identity.

Recently, at an event, I ran into a friend's sister who is a psychologist, and one word lead to another, I mentioned that I have never felt as the main character of my own story, due to how I grew up, lack of representation, lack of understanding, as well how society teaches us that we aren't worth of affection, love, but instead, disaffection, disgust and so on, and the face of realization she had was a massive one, and even said something along the lines of ""That is so mind-blowing, I'm surprised that in no moment of my education or even afterwards, I never once stopped to think that treating patients that are disabled or Deaf/deaf/HoH is as complex as treating that are Black, queer/LGBT+, women and so on."" She wasn't aware of how deep the issues can run in the disabled community.
I'd suggest polling around NTID if you can, the mental health resources at the university sucked in more ways than one so you may get some good answers there.
Ugh that's unfortunate to read. I would have expected NTID to have mental health resources specifically geared towards supporting their students. Thank you for the comment, and suggestion I will definitely check it out!
It's more that the mental health resources suck campus wide, not just for NTID. Lot of mediocre to bad counselors from the experience of my group."
p0044,Have a hard time learning sign due to my other mental disabilities,18,deaf,"You got this! Honestly I was the same way.

p0046,Psychiatrist question,0,deaf,"If you want to work in mental health in the Deaf community, I cannot recommend Dr. Neil Glickman and Dr. Sanjay Gulati highly enough. Dr. Glickman is a psychologist and is hearing but has signed for decades. Still, he uses a Deaf interpreter (CDI) when necessary, and he is experienced enough to know when he needs one. The same goes for Dr. Gulati, except that he is a psychiatrist and he is Deaf himself. He has made it his life's mission to get Language Deprivation Syndrome added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. I hope he can, it needs to be there. Search these names and read these articles and watch these videos, and it will give you an idea of what's going on. There are others as well. One name will lead to another, they often work together. I will tell you that this is a unique subfield, and it can get very complex. This is because psychology and psychiatry and just therapy and mental health in general is the most linguistic experience a person can ever have, probably. And many of the patients have been victims of a society that does not recognize or promote their language in its natural form, something the rest of the world doesn't have to worry about. Most therapists, for example, have never encountered someone who can't readily converse with their own parent or sibling or colleague, for example. The average practitioner doesn't know the first thing about this community. It's not their fault, it's just the way it is. But I'm glad to see when people want to learn more. The doctors I have recommended use American Sign Language, used in the United States and most parts of Canada. I am not familiar with such practitioners in other countries. However, I'm sure they exist."

My family is in Georgia, but being a gay man I absolutely refuse to live in the south again. There are other options that are sunny, but they don’t have the beach. Legally you are allowed to pull your mask down to communicate with a HOH or deaf person, but it just isn’t happening at my workplace, at least for me, I’m not sure about customers as I generally work the bar. You’re right this is a very divided issue and I’m not really advocating for no masks anywhere. I just can’t stomach the idea of working for $20 an hour or less. Fortunately there is an end date to this, as someone told me in this thread. So that is a very big relief."
p0048,Would it be okay for a hearing person to access a crisis line with vrs or something similar?,5,deaf,"I work for a call relay center and strongly agree with u/surdophobe 's comment. The appropriate call type for you OP, is HCO through the TRS (text-based relay service) not ASL with a videophone through VRS. HCO is designed to be used by any people who are able to hear over the phone but for whatever reason are unable to speak. Some common examples of people who use this service are autistic individuals and people with selective mutism but a mental health situation resulting in inability to speak would certainly qualify as well. I have the contact number and email for the relay service and I will DM you with those details.
I would recommend you use a TTY or text relay service as these are used by both DdHH people and those with speech difficulties or who are non/semi verbal (I fit both categories and it works well for me, especially since I'm not fluent in my country's sign language and English is easier to communicate with).

I don't know if this is available in the US (I think it's available in some places?), but over here you can register to text emergency services which could also be helpful when there is a crisis and you cannot talk or find it difficult. After the quick registration, you can text them from your phone.

There's also a text crisis service called SHOUT here which is the same as a mental health crisis helpline but in text messages and it works fine for me. Maybe there's a similar thing in the US.

These services are not exclusive to DdHH people afaik, I've never used VRS due to my lack of efficiency in my country's sign language. They are useful to have and free."
p0049,is it possible to not admit or struggle with deaf identity?,21,deaf,"It's called different things because it manifests in different ways, but basically yes - it can be hard to feel like you identify with a group that you've had so little contact with.  You've been mostly muddling by through making yourself fit in with your hearing peers because that was your source of social interaction etc.  Now that you're getting older that's not quite working and your social worker's noticed something in your interactions. 

Honestly it's not a bad thing to go talk to a psychiatrist or counselor.  Mental health is important and it looks so different for different people.  It's not like they're going to immediately say you need medication or you're weird, or you're going to get thrown into 24/7 mental unit or whatever.  It's just to help you sort things out in a safe, educated way.
It's hard to admit to oneself that you have a disability. At most, you want to look at it as an inconvenience or annoyance that you can just cope with. Because, for it to be a real thing, feels like an admission of weakness.

And also, a lot of people just don't know what to do about their deafness. They just think they're broken. And it's easy to get stuck in that rut.

Sometimes you need someone else to help you see past the immediate problems and find whatever the right path forward is. Deafness can be a big barrier, and a lot of people need help knowing what to do next.

So, definitely recommend therapy for anyone who struggles (hearing related or not). A mental health pro can be the level-headed person that helps you get through your emotions to get through whatever's blocking you from living your life."
p0050,Just a vent over feeling curtailed professionally,6,deaf,"Thank you for your feedback and thoughtful response! It meant a lot to have someone respond. You bring up a good point in recognizing the long term. 

I guess I feel a juxtaposition for my preference to work pretty independently (without a huge dependence on captions) with a desire to work on more complex assignments that seem to only be available in a teamwork setting. It seems like it would be best to go after opportunities that do not challenge me to interact with people in a way that I either can't or don't have the patience for right now even if it cost me opportunities that are not the right fit.  

I've had the CI checked, there isn't really anything they can do. :( 

To be honest, I think I was looking for a few people to say ""Yeah, captioning (while helpful) doesn't put me on even footing with hearing people within leadership roles"" to help feel better about my choice to not take on the that kind of challenge. I don't think it worked, but maybe that is good thing, that means that some people here really did find the right fit of accommodations to thrive in their workplaces and my expectations are either too high and/or I haven't found the right fit. 

Thank you for writing!"
p0051,Relationship advice: deaf husband/hearing wife wanting more efficient communication,56,deaf,"I’m deaf, my husband is hearing. I’m glad you’re being proactive learning ASL. The largest struggle for me was having to adapt all my life in a hearing world. My parents were told not to teach me ASL because I wouldn’t be successful. Well this led to years of isolation. Family gatherings I play on my phone as well because people tend to get awkward when I ask them to repeat themselves. They also like to tease I responded incorrectly from mishearing info or I am just plain exhausted trying to keep up in groups or background noise. I’m fine playing on my phone, I find it relaxing, I also need it to decompress. For some reason there’s always someone that finds it rude but hey, my mental health and being is more important than a little social gathering. 
Learning ASL after so long feels so unnatural, it’s difficult. Using ASL, the sentence structure is different form verbal so I find that challenging as well. It’s also discouraging going in person. It ends up feeling like an all day event just to learn a bit of ASL. However, when I took ASL online, at my own pace. I enjoyed learning. Gallaudet offers free courses online. See if he will start there. Then I highly recommend taking the the ASL and Deaf Studies certification. Again, the online and convenience of it I think will help.
Edit: some typos"
p0052,"Apparently, finding interpreters is impossible.",86,deaf,"This is absolutely unacceptable.  I am an interpreter, and I have worked in mental health settings in a supervisory capacity (not as an interpreter).  About 30% of our residents were deaf.  There was an interpreter at EVERY junction of the residents’ mental health therapy and care, AND the faculty and staff (including me, a supervisor) could sign.  A facility like the one I worked at is not the norm, but it certainly exists. Where are you in the states? Also, look into remote interpreting if there are genuinely no interpreters in your area (unlikely, and not optimal, I know).   Yeah, technically a private facility can just say no.  But there are private places that will be accommodating, as well as publicly run options.
I'm truly sorry about what you're going through. It's bullshit. 

My wife is a deaf therapist, and we live in a deaf mecca (Rochester, NY) and she's very frustrated with the mental health system here. There is a serious lack of residential treatment facilities that can accommodate deaf patients. It's even worse for difficult patients, because they typically get kicked out of RTF's due to serious behavioral issues. And that basically means they have absolutely nowhere left to go.

If it's that bad here, then it's likely much worse everywhere else. Hearing people basically don't give a damn when it comes to mental health services for the deaf, and deaf therapists have difficulty trying to push this issue through the hearing-centric system. 

Funding for deaf mental health services also is a joke. Everything is run on shoestring budget."

p0055,Finding mental healthcare for coing with disability,10,disability,"I find from my experience on disability. With mental health being one of my disabilities , all any of my docs do is push meds . I’m on my 4th antidepressant :(
During COVID times, i devised a online platform concept where people can get counseling and holistic care for their mental health issues. I am not aware ( have not researched online) if such a platform exists even today, but its something i feel will address the issue of scalability in providing mental healthcare .  
Can you please explain more what you exactly mean by a 'disability informed' approach ? It is not clear from your post.
For years the mental health services place I was in would change my therapist every 5-6months each one it took me a long time to get established with near when I suddenly hear they are changing me and it’s made it really hard to find anyone who understands.

Last year they did a switch and thankfully have not been removed from this therapist as they happen to understand me on both the ADHD front (we both have that and I’ve got autism too) but on my physical health stuff and how it’s impacted parts of my mental health and vice versa. She’s helped me make a lot of progress and really work on advocating for myself more as well as not getting so stuck in doom brain mode like I used to whenever something bad happens.

First therapist in years I’ve ever made any genuine progress with towards a better quality of life.

It reminds me of all my past ones and makes me quite sad, the old ones were always the quite ones who sat there and waited for me to say something or just go “how are you today?” And never try leading anything to make the conversation easier and more natural. They also rarely bothered to learn about my disabilities and how they effected me so I never really opened up to those ones about me and my stuff and what effects me what works and what doesn’t etc."
p0056,"I am in desperate need of advice, I’m still getting used to everything ",2,disability,"FND and conversion disorder are both very real and the symptoms can be very disabling. Have you seen a neuro PT at all? I'd highly recommend getting in to see one. They are pretty amazing and the one I got to shadow could pretty quickly work out if it was something organic or if it was something functional. She also has an awesome success rate with her fnd patients.

I'd also highly suggest seeing a psychologist. Dealing with unexplained symptoms is tough and you need to look after your mental health as much as your physical health. Poor mental health can make your symptoms a whole lot worse no matter what the diagnosis turns out to be, but if it is fnd or conversion disorder then it'll really make things a lot harder to recover from."
p0057,"Donald Trump labels his opponent, Kamala Harris, ‘mentally disabled’ in latest rhetorical escalation",220,disability,Well obviously no one has ever considered trumps mental health issues either.
p0058,"I’m becoming bitter at a friend calling themselves disabled, and I don’t like it",152,disability,"I always say ""it's not the disability olympics"".  It seems like for whatever reason your friend feels the need to compare your situation and symptoms to theirs every time you bring something up, and I GET why that makes you uncomfortable, and pushes you further into being uncomfortable with them labeling common dx that would not typically be considered disabling by the medical community as disabling to them. It probably feels like they are coopting that identity for themselves, when you've just barely gotten used to it for you.

A few things that might help- you seem to be pretty certain this friend actually does have pain and isn't simply malingering. Remind yourself that they may be clinging to your symptoms so hard, because their own common dxs that they have been given so far might not adequately explain the volume and type of pain they perceive. There might be more going on for them the they are able to get dx'd at the moment. There may be mental health complications that are making the physical issues they experience significantly more difficult to navigate.

Most importantly though, I have found with people like this, it's important to validate their experience repeatedly and obviously: I tell them that yeah, that really sucks and must be difficult, that I can't understand their particular pain/symptom because mine is different, but that that doesn't really matter because pain is pain symptoms are symptoms, one type isn't worse or better than the other because any kind of pain or symptoms make life hard to navigate. That I can't compare my pain to theirs because that's apples to oranges BUT that I empathize that they struggle with pain, and all types of pain suck. It takes time (months often), but usually the person stops competing their symptoms against mine, instead simply discussing what they actually struggle with, and asking what I do.

Sometimes, none of that works and I just straight up refuse to discuss my health with the person any more. If they bring it up, I say thanks for asking but I'd rather not discuss it right now and would prefer to discuss only happy topics. Then I immediately change the subject (its very helpful to have anyone else you hang out with also on this plan if you go this route- my husband knows the people who fall in this category and backs me up). If they bring up their own health, I also politely say, I'm sorry you are dealing with that--and then immediately change the subject. They eventually figure out the topic is off the table.

It's about THEM and ultimately has very little to do with you. The reason they choose to identify as disabled isn't something you are entitled to or can change - even if they are genuinely malingering - but you can change how you respond to it, and in no way are you required to participate in the disability olympics. That takes way too much energy!
Something to keep in mind is doing the appointments themselves and not keeping up with the homework might just be all they’re capable of doing. Especially if they’re neurodivergent consistency issues is probably a part of them being disabled. It definitely is for me and I had to quit PT because of the amount of shame/guilt and annoyance I got from the therapist for that exact issue. It really sucks cause I definitely need the therapy.

Idk what their exact issues are but a lot of things have to be self diagnosed in order to get a formal disagnosis as access to practitioners is difficult and sometimes impossible. If I hadn’t self diagnosed my autism I probably never would’ve gotten an official appointment.

Idk if that helps the emotions or not but I hope it at least helps with some perspective.

You also might just be providing actual information they don’t know how to get otherwise so they see it as really helpful and are saying it partially as a “hey thanks I didn’t know about this. It feels familiar”

I think talking with them is an important step cause it sounds like they’re not aware at all. And maybe talking with a therapist as well if you haven’t already. I can understand it being annoying and downright distressing so taking care of your own mental health is important also.

It’s not necessarily anyone’s fault or “problem” you might just need additional emotional support around it which is really important. And they might need an explanation cause they sound oblivious and are likely unaware of the harm it’s causing.

Even just something simple like “hey I’m glad I’m able to help with perspective and information but when I talk about specifics like this I’m usually looking for emotional support instead of comparison and sometimes the immediate jump to how you feel about it can be hurtful when I need support.”

Your feelings are definitely valid either way also like your feelings are telling you important stuff and it’s important to listen to them fully and figure out what they’re trying to tell you even if you don’t talk directly about it to your friend.l about the specifics.
While I agree that disability isn't a competition (I think we can all agree that would be one crappy comp), it sounds to me as if they might have just one mental health disorder. One super-specific one. I won't mention it here, because I'm not a PhD of Psychology, but it sounds as though this person should get checked out for their mental health for this exact reason. 

Encourage them, tell them that the psychologist would love to hear about all the diagnoses they've gotten, how they're taking care of themselves with them, and how much of a struggle it is to find out that yet another new ailment they've never heard of has been ""found"" to be affecting them. Trust those of us who have been to a real psych doc, there's no way your friend will get out of that room without the diagnosis of this one particular mental health issue. 

After that, for them, it will be far harder to convince any doctor that something else new is happening with their health, unless the doctor comes to that conclusion themselves. And you will finally have the peace of mind in knowing that your friend is actually disabled, so I guess you ""win""?

Or the easier way, stop being friends. You aren't in a good headspace to handle them, and they just want a sounding board for all their perceived ailments. It's unhealthy for both of you, and since they're obviously more needful of your time than you are of theirs, you have to be the one to cut the cord.
That’s happened to me too.  I’ve had multiple mental health professionals fire me as their patient because they said I was too difficult to work with.  It honestly really triggered my PTSD.  When I think about it, I try to tell myself that the real problem wasn’t that I’m too difficult, but that they clearly didn’t have the experience/expertise/education on my specific conditions to properly help me.  When a mental health professional says something like that what it really means is that they’re not good enough at their job to treat you, not that you are a bad person or a failure somehow 
That's really cool. I'm glad you enjoyed the experience so much. I prefer reading books and stuff to dealing college campuses though. lol. I think although going the psychology special interest route might be a particularly challenging path, I'd say it becomes invaluable. Versus learning communication skills without having as much foundational understanding of why it's effective on most people.

Granted, it's not really fair to expect every autistic person to devote years of their life to studying human psychology to mesh better with society. So I feel like I've gone around in a circle to some extent where the original intent was to essentially get really good at masking (even in private out of internalized ableism), and now I understand enough about psychology to know that level of masking is detrimental to my mental health and so I do it less.

I'm still trying to strike that balance between being safe and being myself because while ex: rocking back and forth when stressed hurts absolutely no one, it absolutely does draw a lot of unwanted and potentially even dangerous attention.
You’d hope so, but unfortunately mental health professionals aren’t always as ethical as we’d expect them to be"
p0059,How to Get a Mental Health Evaluation Abroad Recognized for U.S. Disability Support?,1,disability,"If you are talking about Social Security disability, there are two different programs.  The first is SSDI - Social Security Disability Insurance.  This is the disability coverage your FICA taxes go toward.   Generally, an adult who has never worked or paid into the Social Security system (and thus never earned work credits) is not eligible for SSDI.  There is a limited exception called DAC (disabled adult child) benefits, where someone who became disabled before age 22 can draw SSDI based on a parent's earning record.  However, DAC benefits can only be paid if the parent is already drawing SS disability or retirement benefits, or is deceased.  So even if it were established that David became disabled before the age cutoff, he still would not receive benefits until you start drawing retirement or disability benefits yourself, or you predecease him.   

The other disability program is SSI - Supplemental Security Income for the blind, elderly and disabled.  It is a means-tested program with very strict income and asset limits for eligibility, and the most it pays is currently less than $950 per month.   He will not be eligible for SSI unless he was actually living in the U.S.  

I'm unsure of the answer to your question about disability evaluations conducted by a non U.S. physician, but I suspect the answer is they would not be enough for Social Security purposes.   To qualify for social security disability, the claimant needs very complete, compelling medical documentation.  This is especially true for mental health issues.  

There are other programs such as Medicaid for which David might become eligible if he lived in the U.S., but these programs vary a lot by state, so you would need to look at what's available specifically in your state. 

Given the complexity of David's situation, I would highly recommend that you consult with an attorney knowledgeable about disability issues, especially about estate/life care planning for the needs of a disabled adult child.  

Have you talked to David about whether he wants to come to live with you, or to live in the U.S.?  It seems like this would be the most important first step to take.  As David would be considered an adult in the U.S., you would not have the right to make decisions on his behalf.  If you believe he is unable to make his own medical, financial and legal decisions, you may need to consider seeking guardianship or conservatorship.  At minimum, you would need to hold his power of attorney and health care proxy in order to apply for services on his behalf or be involved in medical decision making."
p0060,Is this Disability Discrimination (UK)?,0,disability,"I am unsure if it's discrimination, but comparing a non physical access need to a physical access need doesn't help your case. I'm not saying PTSD is easy, or not an impairment - but you are able to physically access the building, and a physically impaired person is simply not.

It'd work better to frame this entirely within a mental health accessibility context, as these are simply different problems with different managements.

I'll also say under UK law, it's about whether or not your access requirement is deemed ""reasonable"" by the organisation providing the access. They'll argue that they have provided reasonable access measures most likely, so going forward with discrimination is unlikely to get you anywhere.

Hopefully PALS can help you find a solution though!
I am in the US so I'm not talking about UK law, although we share a common legal ancestry and sometimes share precedent. I am only sharing my experiences and what can be, in my country, considered undue burden. Your legal system also uses the same ""reasonable"" terminology as the US and your Equality Act explicitly states that discrimination is unlawful *unless there is good reason*.

My husband died in a hospital in my city. It was deeply traumatizing. I need to receive a specific medical treatment there every quarter. When I asked it be moved to a different hospital in my city, in the same hospital system, I was denied. My provider doesn't work at the hospital and the treatment I receive isn't provided there - I need to go to the specific specialty clinic to receive my treatment. I worked with my therapist at the time to develop coping strategies to learn to manage being in the same hospital where he died.

I think it's worthwhile to ask if there is a reason it needs to be at this specific hospital, but I also think it's important to be aware of hierarchies of power, whether we find them just or unjust, and function accordingly. If you need this medical care and the people with the power to provide you the medical care will only provide it at this singular location, it might be an option to work with your mental health care team to develop coping strategies around this specific trigger (grounding techniques, EMDR, being accompanied by someone to support and guide you through the current moment, etc).
I don’t think you fully understand, and to be fair that’s my fault for making not making it clear. I have tried to access the building with support of mental health professionals and suffered a psychotic break in the process, harming myself and trying to harm others. The building is not only inaccessible for me, it’s dangerous to myself and others.

There have provided no access measures at all to tackle the issue. It’s not an issue with the department or what will happen at the appointment. It’s an issue with the building. So don’t know how that would be considered reasonable.

I think the comparison to physical disabilities is a tricky one, personally, I think they are often taken more seriously than mental disabilities and it helps me get the point across that in the eyes of the law they should be the same.
I’m way past the point of grounding techniques helping. Being there with someone does not help, we have tried. I have suffered a psychotic break trying to get into that building supported by two mental health nurses. It’s inaccessible for me. I also know an ECG can be done at almost any hospital around here, it’s not a specialised test.
Thank you so much. It absolutely sucks that things like this happen and I’m sorry you were in such an awful situation. I’m the same with not being able to drive past the building. Unfortunately as I’m in Wales I don’t have ‘right to choose’ so I have any right to swap my cars to another place without extremely good reason. I just really hope PALS helps me in advocating that my mental health condition is good reason.
Personally, I don't believe that comparison works well - coming from both a physically disabled person, and as someone who worked in accessibility for a number of years. Whether we like it or not, the organisation is placed in power over the individual in these situations, therefore it's less about the principle and more about what they will accept as an argument.

That is why I would advise to avoid the comparison, as the easy retort is ""This isn't a physical accessibility issue"" because it isn't, and that can stop the discussion there and then.

What you have outlined above about danger is way more in line with what they may accept. They are unlikely to accept the building being the issue - as the issue is the building may add to a certain response, the response is what is denying access.

I don't know what they may argue back, but they'd probably say that the support of mental health professionals constitutes a reasonable adjustment. Regardless, I stand by my point that I don't think comparison to physical impairment is helpful - and in the eyes of the law, it's not about the nature of the impairment, it's about what the organisation deem ""reasonable"" and that does change based on accessibility needs.
If you don't get anywhere with the cardiologists, it might help to talk to your mental health team about the issue, since they seem to be very involved in your care. (I didn't want to assume - from my understanding it can be very difficult to get mental health care with the NHS.) They are going to be infinitely more informed about your challenges and what has and has not worked for you in the past than me, an internet stranger.

If they're in the same hospital system, perhaps your mental health team could advocate on your behalf to have your testing moved to a different building?"
p0061,About to give up,3,disability,"I left my job because I had a manager who would not accommodate my mental health I have serve anxiety so I asked for different hours and a place to go to calm down but they didn’t said I go in to office but people come and go then they feel obliged to ask if I’m ok and burst out crying they run away so I started going to my car and calling help lines and mangers didn’t like it. I got signed off and I wasn’t told I need to have a meeting if off for month so I missed a call and got accused of being on holiday and faking my anxiety, I now suffer with agoraphobia and scared to leave home as fear people think I’m faking and should be working. I just quit I miss working but our health is more important so I choose health. You can go back when you are better and ask her to make these arrangements to on your return."
p0062,People believe depression is disabling until you actually show signs of being disabled,202,disability,"Society is victim to capitalist propaganda. We've been conditioned to equate human value with ability to work. With making money. If you aren't doing those things, people perceive you as a deadweight, a mooch, a leach, a parasite, etc. But there's a huge difference between sitting around doing nothing because you simply don't want to work or contribute and not working because of a legitimate reason. I honestly think people get jealous. That they want a break from their daily grind, and that's why they're so eager to accuse disabled people of not trying hard enough or ""faking"" it. Oh, the irony, right? Jealous of this??? They truly don't know how much we suffer if they feel jealous of us. Their feelings are so misdirected though. What they should be doing is getting mad at their employers for exploiting them and unionizing the workplace if possible. They wouldn't feel so jealous if they actually had decent work hours, decent vacation times, PTO, paid sick days, and actually good benefits.
I try to not care when others say things like this to me. But it’s so hard. Where I grew up many people didn’t believe in mental illness (Bible Belt of America).I feel terrible when I am unable to do anything I feel like I’m supposed to constantly be doing things but I can’t. 
When I got approved for disability I felt so validated and seen. I thought I’d be trying to get approved for years fighting because I have mental illness. I have BPD, MDD, ADHD, NSSIB, EDNOS, GAD, CPTSD IBS and “marijuana abuse”. People think I’m lazy but my body is in constant pain, I take 4 daily medications, have side effects, extremely poor memory, can’t focus on anything I dissociate all of the time, just took a shower yesterday in I don’t know how long and I’ve lost 20lb in 2 months. I want to do things but I can’t, why do people think we want this? It is miserable. I wish I could just do things, I’ve lost my life to mental illness. I’ve missed spring and summer because I can’t make myself do anything. I wish I could enjoy my life but that’s never happened. I wish I could’ve gone to the beach this summer, smell the flowers in spring, i wanted to swim and go on hikes. I want to be outside for autumn but instead I wake up crying and have the energy for nothing, I sleep because it keeps me safe from myself. I’ve lost my only friend because they don’t understand and would compare their physical illness to my mental illness. 
I try to tell myself “who cares what others think” but it’s so hurtful to be judged by my mental illness and lack of ability to take care of myself. I can’t do my ADL’s and I just wish they would have sympathy. When I get bad and reach out for help, I get lectured and yelled at by people who are supposed to love and care about me. 
Mental illness is illness and I will never stop advocating for us. No matter how many people judge/dislike me. Everyone deserves access to have a roof over their heads, everyone deserves accessible mental health care. It’s not our fault, we did not choose this.
Substitute severe anxiety for me, which leads to depression because of inaction. I feel so seen. I toiled and hated it for 30 years. I can't seem to do it anymore. I've never heard that term bedrotting, but I feel like this is what I'm doing. My bed is my safety zone. I'm so poor, but I live with a friend who understands. I try to do Gigwork, but I feel so scared to go ""out there."" It's avoidance of discomfort to the point of great fear. I failed again yesterday. This is probably one of the worst developed countries to have mental health issues in. This is a pull-up- your-bootstraps kinda country. Hard work!! Make money!! Don't be ""lazy!!"" Do whatever it takes to get ahead and be successful or die!! I hate being like this. I have lots of help and meds, but there is no magic bullet to fix my mind. I am put off by the oversimulation of the work day, business hours, The Rat Race, Hustle and Bustle, etc. Something happened to me over time. This society seems to have very little tolerance for debilitating mental health. It's only helped by SSI or SSDI, which people can barely survive off of without help from loved ones and friends. That's only IF you win Disability. I hate being like this, but I HAVE contributed to society and want to live a good rest of my life. I'm 55. Fear keeps me at home, and that depresses me. I didn't used to be like this, but I've had massive, traumatic life changes over the last 20 years.
Sorry if it's too personal, but were you diagnosed with a mental health condition and then also diagnosed with CFS?

I have a mental condition and I realize it (and the medication) can make a person tired, but sometimes I can hardly function. My mother was also diagnosed with CFS, but I never took it seriously until now.
Yup, I've gone two months a few times without showering and doing quite well if I can make it once a week. I have schizophrenia and the negative symptoms can look a lot like severe depression and are worsened by meds. Avolition, alogia and anhedonia are big ones. My life isn't something to be envied when I live in poverty and can't manage to clean myself or my house and rarely even get any enjoyment from video games or my old hobbies and don't have the concentration for a movie. For years I had musical anhedonia. Of all the ailments I've had mental illness is the worst and the cruelest, I don't know why people actually take it less seriously. Mental health is health."

p0064,How to bring up disability to therapist?,5,disability,"Therapists love getting this information early on.


You could write a list to hand over during the appointment, send an e-mail in advance, give a PowerPoint presentation, make a diagram.


The first session will start with your therapist going over their terms of service, and making sure you understand their duty of care/mandatory reporter responsibilities, and consent to be their client.


Then they'll ask why you're seeing them, and that's when you give the rundown of all the stuff going on with you.


It might help you to prepare a timeline in advance that you can refer to. (When various conditions/symptoms became obvious to you, when you received diagnoses, key periods of abuse or traumatic events, etc.)


I honestly don't know what role your therapist could play in ""helping with my disability and struggles with the medical system"". What do you mean by that?


They can help you find and trial strategies to protect your mental health, build resilience, and get stuff done. They can help you process trauma and heal, help you learn how to build healthy relationships etc. 


They probably can't help you with paperwork unrelated to therapy or navigating the system, advise your decisions or advocate for you. 


But they can help you work out what decision you want to make, and some therapists do have lived experience navigating these systems and can tell you what worked for them.
I apologize if this is untoward, but I do not understand this question.

Of course we can tell our providers that we are disabled! A mental health therapist is not necessarily going to be aware of the physical health conditions. In my experience, it has only been therapists who are in a clinic in the same hospital system as my physical health doctors who have access to my diagnoses and medications. Every other therapist, I have had to tell them about my diagnoses and medications. Even when the therapist is with the hospital system, I generally need to spell out what my diagnoses mean because even most medical providers are not familiar with what I have and even then, they are not familiar with what I experience day-to-day unless I tell them.

OP isn't talking about applying for disability benefits - I assume your comment is aimed at folks who are applying for government disability benefits like SSI/SSDI since you mention ""that this has been going on for at least a year."" OP is just seeing a therapist to cope with a traumatic experience regarding their mobility aid and thus very much should be in a position to talk about the need for that mobility aid."

p0067,Almost homeless… what do I do? ,14,disability,"That sounds about accurate. 

Bed in DV shelters are at a premium - last I knew, my city's DV shelter had a waitlist and they only accept women (and young children) abused by a male partner. 

Waitlists for public housing are very long. Prior to the pandemic, I briefly dated a man who works with HUD in public housing and he said (out of frustration) that people had better odds of winning the lottery than in getting into public housing. Some cities have a pipeline for supportive housing through the shelter system, but that does require entering into the generally homeless shelter system, not the DV one. (This can be a real concern as the shelter system is often quite dangerous, especially to women, people with physical disabilities, and people with mental health disabilities.)

Finding roommates is likely the path of least resistance. Lots of people live with roommates and if you find people you get along with, it can be a long term situation. You would need to share your space, but I personally prefer not to live alone."

[AskJan](https://askjan.org/) can help you figure out job accommodation. Your local Office of Vocational Rehabilitation can also help you out in figuring out work that you can do with your disabilities. 

If you want to apply for SSI/SSDI, that's with [the Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/). There is a page on their website where you can calculate what you might be paid if you are awarded disability. Marriage can affect SSI payments.

If you need health insurance, you can see what you might be eligible for under the Affordable Care Act in your state. You may or may not need to pay for it. Some states, like Pennsylvania, have carve outs for Medical Assistance for Worker's with Disabilities. Health insurance includes behavioral health coverage. While you wait for health insurance, you may be able to find a therapist who works with a sliding scale or in community health centers. 

You may have a Federally Qualified Health Center near you. They can provide health care (including mental health) if you are uninsured. They will likely have resources to help you access insurance coverage."

Note: I am in no way saying that because you have pain in your leg, that you'll end up in a wheelchair. So please don't read what I've said & panic."
p0072,"I don't want my disabled ex to be homeless, but I need them to move out. ",115,disability,"Group Home. Try your local mental health agencies. They may have emergency housing.
I Was In Your Ex Situation Unfortunately. I definitely Understand that Especially Financially and Emotionally 

As Taking care of a Disabled Person is Very Mentally Draining 

And Society is Individualistic and Ableist so it makes it no better 

I Tried to help my situation. I reached out to every organization for help

I have Invisible Disabilities as well so people can't see it so therefore I look abled bodied 

I worked jobs Lifting 300lbs 400lbs barrels of water and fruit and vegetables 

Crowded job had panic attacks blurred vision lightheadedness and dizziness 

Everyday at the jobs

Till the fact my body couldn't handle feeling like that everyday 

Plus it was messing with my mental health 

I felt like a burden on family for a issue I didn't ask to have.

Like I understand people Houses and if I can't keep a job 

Which I couldn't I tried but always quitted 

So I got kicked out a lot by family and friends of the family 

Which I understand and stuff 

Really Don't Agree With The ""Learned Helplessness"" thing 

I understand it has some valid points 

But I just personally feel like it's a Individualistic approach or judgement 

To someone that is trying to get their situation atleast for my situation 

I was trying to work jobs getting headaches and Panic attacks just being on the phone 

And I worked a lot of public open jobs 

Which I wished people seem my disabilities so they wouldn't call me lazy or such

Or say things like ""Learned Helplessness"" and stuff 

Because I actually was trying to help myself 

Just I can't control the Disability process 

I can't put a gun to nobody head and say approve me for disability in less than a year 

Or tell a job to get me accomodations that actually benefits me and not the business 

It's so easy to go to Jail than actually trying survive in society

But I understand my Family and friends kicking me out 

Wasn't anything personal it's capitalism 

If I can't bring in a profit or benefit individually to a household or someone life.

I'm a burden and I understand that. Can't Force nobody to help you 

And I understand people mental health just taking someone else in 

Or caring for a disabled person 

Even though I didn't ask to have a disability 

But if it's making you comfortable evict them don't feel guilty 

I understand taking care of people with a disability or just anyone is difficult as well 

Atleast for me I didn't get evicted like that 

Atleast in the black community we don't do all that legal stuff 

They just put a Gun out on you or make physical threats to you 

From my experience 

I left the same day 

Remember my uncle making a threat 

That ""My Shit Better be in the Garage By Saturday"" it was a Thursday that week in 2018

Had to Leave unfortunately 

Which I did plus living with people that doesn't want you there 

Is very mentally draining 

I was scared to leave my room

Because I got threats violent threats 

Because I couldn't keep a job 

Just Disability takes years for people 

Especially non invisible disabilities 

So it took years 

I was seeing my Mental health workers 

Which I was in Georgia so I didn't have insurance 

So they kept supplying me with the same medicine that didn't work 

And I couldn't afford to get the new medicine my doctor prescribed 

I understand you have to do what's best for you 

I know I was trying 

Like I felt like I was a burden and unaliving myself at. That time 

Because I didn't want to be a burden 

I hate being a burden on people 

That's why I'm scared to get in relationships with women 

Because my disability is something I'm trying to figure out 

But I didn't ask for this

Feel like Eugenicists want me dead 

Not trying to trigger anyone 

Just your ex situation sounds like my situation 

But you have to do what's best for your mental health 

I didn't take it personal.

Even though it was family members 

That I couldn't reach out to 

Disabilities in my life is just hard 

Just people don't realize saying Learned Helplessness 

They don't realize it's not too much help as you think 

And plus it's a very huge waiting list 

Sometimes years long

Just getting help is not immediate

Just not enough resources 

Especially for a person like me that couldn't keep a stable job 

Which I felt bad I couldn't 

But people wasn't in my body they couldn't see how I was feeling 

Not trying to trigger anyone
At the end of the day, it isn't your responsibility.  They need to make an effort to either get a job or file for SS disability, section 8, food stamps, Medicaid, and find housing.  You didn't indicate what the disability is.  Are you actually caregiving, like feeding, bathing, etc, or just financial?  You're not family.  Even if you were, it's not worth sacrificing your mental health for this.  It sounds like you have your own family in the home as well.  So they're dealing with this as well?

It's very easy for someone with ""learned helplessness"" to give up and just rely on someone else.  My VA therapist introduced me to that term.  It sounds like your ex is experiencing this.  

""In psychology, learned helplessness is a state that occurs after a person has experienced a stressful situation repeatedly. They believe that they are unable to control or change the situation, so they do not try, even when opportunities for change are available."""
p0073,D.C. Can’t Dismiss Lawsuit Over Police Response to Mental Health Crises | Attorneys say the district’s practice of sending armed police officers to mental health emergencies violates the Americans With Disabilities Act.,37,disability,"Here is a major problem no one wants to look at regarding these mental health issues.  
A. We don't have enough mental health professionals to begin with for non-emergency issues.  
B. There isn't enough incentive or pay to attract people with the training to law enforcement.  
C. Current law enforcement is not setup to deal with the issue.  
D. In many locations even an Ambulance will not approach or provide help until law enforcement has confirmed an area is clear.  
This is all adding to the problems we have right now. None of this makes it acceptable for law enforcement to be stepping on peoples rights, or killing innocents. And it's the people suffering and in need of help most who are the victims because of it. But until we really look at the most basic building blocks causing the problems, nothing is going to change. Even if we get rid of things like qualified immunity."
p0074,“Respectful Disability Communications” in regards to patient care,114,disability,"Exactly. With how varied people’s opinions are, and how many more important issues we have, fussing about terminology just detracts from the real issues. They want to talk about communication with disabled people? Learn to take us seriously when we have problems or concerns. Confront your own biases about disabled people and other marginalized groups. Train medical professionals to communicate with D/deaf and HOH people, cognitively impaired or language impaired people, people in the middle of mental health crises, etc etc. I don’t know, even just work on presenting pain scales in a more accurate way for people with chronic pain! So many things I can think of that would be much more impactful and important, and yet it always comes back to able-bodied people fumbling around the word “disability”."
p0075,Anxiety/doubt despite approval,4,disability,"I have LTD through my employer on the basis of mental health. The constant medication changes and having the insurance company monitor my every shit is getting to be too much.

>>It’s like every “you can do it” cheerleader over the course of my life convinced me that I just need to try harder.

I feel this one! Sometimes I think this is all my fault because I'm not trying hard enough.

Although LTD can be a relief, the hoops they make you jump through is like a full time job."
p0076,Am I secretly ableist? And if I am how do I change?,19,disability,"I’m disabled and I’m sure I’ve said inappropriate things to other disabled people, it’s just part of being human.. sometimes we put our foot in our mouths! And I’m sure I’ve parked my wheelchair in people’s way in shops, or had my walker in a spot that has annoyed someone - but taking up space in the world means occasionally being in the space someone else wants to enter too. 
You’re human, treat yourself with the same gentleness and compassion you would others, and instead of living with the fear of being ableist try and put that energy into what you could do to assist disabled people (including mental health advocacy) 💜"
p0077,Work has my loa request pending and listed me as ineligible for short term disability ,10,disability,"Many short- and long-term disabilities have an exclusion period for pre-existing conditions.   You may want to double check your policy for any exclusions.   If you had a previous mental health diagnosis, they may be treating your current diagnosis as pre-existing, even though it's a result of recent trauma.

I am so very sorry for what you've been going through.  

Your doctor may need to submit additional records to show that your current need for leave is related to the trauma of losing your home and pet, not part of a preexisting diagnosis.  

Also, check to see if your employer has an type of employee assistance programs that may help you out financially.   Also, the Red Cross often has emergency assistance programs for people who lose their homes to fire."
p0078,"You're on disability? Let me guess, depression and anxiety?",947,disability,"Oh totally - I use a chair, am losing my hearing, but the mental health issues, especially SI are by far the worst bit. Hope you find some peace.
You look so lovely! love your dress, it suits you perfectly!

And thank you for helping me feel validated and less like a fraud. I’m on disability for multiple mental health reasons and sometimes o feel like my family, friends, and doctors look down on me for it but my therapist has been helping me combat that. Mental health issues can be debilitating and dangerous, I’m glad it’s a valid reason for disability even if it’s a hard battle to be approved.
I’m on disability for mental health reasons (panic disorder with agoraphobia). I just wanted to thank you for posting this. Mental health struggles are no less valid or debilitating. It makes me feel a bit less depressed to know that others (like yourself) understand.
Right! Like, I'm disabled for mental health reasons (ive been on it since i was 8) and its not like i just get a little sad and anxious sometimes. i have severe breakdowns when im under any sort of stress to the point that i could not work a full time job, even though i really wish i could!
I hate you Had To go Through with that. Just tired of ignorant Ableist people sometimes 

Yeah Your Reasons For being on Disability is Valid 

Just Made me Also think about my personal experience with people like that 

Like it makes me Very Sad that Some people don't understand 

How Much Non Visible as well as Visible Disabilities effects people 

Well for me I have Severe Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder 

And bipolar disorder and unspecified PTSD, And recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability 

Just get tired Of The Abled body making disability like the Olympics 

Like people have to compete with each other to see if they Disabilities are severe enough for disability 

Which true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function 

Which this does 

Which I have Agoraphobia I'm the opposite I can't Be Around people 

I can't even go to the Hospital without having a panic attack 

like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent 

Because I still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function 

Only time I leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult 

But I live alone don't really have support 

Since I look so Normal and functional unfortunately 

Plus people think because I'm a black man I'm immune to being disabled or having a disability 

Just kinda hard Because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community 

It effects me daily 

It's detrimental on my economic status 

It's hard to just text and talk on the phone 

Even right now I'm getting a headache 

But it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability 

Try to explain to ignorant people that are Ableist like you dealt with 

I'm quite the opposite I can't stay with people I would have a panic attack unfortunately 

It's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis 

Like they force you to share rooms which aggravates my disabilities.

And aggravates my anxiety PTSD symptoms as well 

Just everyones disability effects people differently 

Mines kinda severe to me 

Like Hate the Competition Thing abled body people created 

Sound like people have to compete with each other like freaking capitalism 

Just for Disability payments 

I hate that 

I wouldn't apply for disability if I didn't need it 

I felt so much guilt younger

People saying my disability is not severe because they can't see it 

Or people always assume you faking it 

Since mental illness they quote you can fake 

Which makes me very upset 

Because they will never know how I feel in my body and mind 

If only that knew they wouldn't be saying that 

And by the way Disability payments can't even cover Rent payments 

A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is over 1500$ for the worst area 

So probably pushing 2000$+ for a good area

Just make me upset and triggered 

Because I have no reason to make up how my disability effects my life daily 

People are so ignorant with mental illness 

They assume because I'm laughing at a movie 

Or taking a selfie 

I'm faking a mental illness 

Which makes me upset 

Like My therapist tells me to watch television using coping mechanisms to distract 

Like they don't know people with disabilities don't always have bad days 

Have a bunch of bad days 

Which I do but 

I like doing the coping mechanisms my therapist taught me 

Just make me cry a little 

Because Disabilities people can't understand what they can't see

Not trying to get emotional 

Just your post resonated with my life 

Bought up bad memories I guess 

Like people think because I workout 

Which is at home by the way 

I can't handle public commercial gyms by the way 

But people assume because I'm trying to use a coping mechanism 

To cope with my disability 

That means I'm faking it 

Or using reddit as a journal like now 

Which I'm anxious as well typing this 

Just people don't understand disabilities effect people differently 

Just Ableism in society 

Might not be to abled body person that has no problems leaving their house 

Or a person that doesn't feel like a lion is being chased after him for just talking or talking on a phone 

Like I live alone but my with my disability I couldn't live with people that would make my condition worse 

I had anxiety just living with family members 

Just because I live alone people think my mental health is not severe 

That really makes me upset 

Because Disabilities effects people differently 

Mines just as severe or life altering as anyone else 

Just because I live alone doesn't mean I'm independent 

I still can't keep a job and stuff 

I don't think being independent is until I can live a functioning life 

And people that have jobs still have disabilities 

Disability effects everyone differently 

I hate this grade scale stuff 

That Ableist people use to say you not deserving of help

Just Ableism sigh

Which I tell distant family and Ableist strangers on social media sites 

I don't have to live in a group home unfortunately 

Because my anxiety would get worse and turn to a crisis 

Just I really relate to your post op 

I guess I got triggered by you quoting Ableist people that said that to you 


But hate people feel like mental illness is not taking seriously 

Which I'm not physically disabled which I definitely respect and understand 

But speaking from a Ableist person perspective 

Like they think people with mental illness or other invisible disabilities 

Should not be considered for disability 

And they always say we lazy or faking because we lazy 

Which I would love to keep a stable job 

But capitalism doesn't value that capitalism values efficiency and profit 

And doesn't value disabled people fitting in 

Not trying to rant on capitalism because I know everyone opinions is different 

I would love to work it's just hard with my conditions

Because due to Ableism they really think People getting disability checks 

That doesn't even cover a full month of rent 

Is a luxury.

Which the Lowest paying minimum wage job pays more than disability pays people.

Like This effected me for a long time 

My whole life 

Just because it gets me emotional knowing because you don't see me walking in a cane or wheelchair 

Or a Down Syndrome or something more visible 

Like I don't have those conditions I'm still disabled as them 

Autism you can't see, learning disabilities you can't see

Even some physical illnesses are invisible 

Such as Sickle Cell and Lupus 

Everything is not visible like blindness 

But my mental illness effects my life as much as any other disability effects people lives in society 

Just because I have muscle or tall black and 6'2""

Keep myself groomed 

I guess I have to look unhoused to For people to understand how my disability effects me seriously 

It's so flawed 

Invisible Disabilities doesn't work like that unfortunately 

I'm deserving of disability as much as anyone that has a disability 

Sorry for the rant OP
Absolutely. I'm tired of the nonsense that mental health disabilities are less disabling or acceptable than physical.
Is it typically easier to get on disability via mental health or physical ?"
p0079,New job and already discriminated against?,13,disability,Please provide any verified legal evidence of this claim. Because I lived in a two  party consent state and had an attorney tell me the opposite while I was in a workplace discrimination situation. The advice I gave is the advice my attorney gave to me if I ever had a meeting with my superiors or HR.
p0080,"What do you do when both partners in a relationship are disabled, and you both need help, but you can't help each other?",24,disability,"I am not saying that it is impossible. It depends on the disabilities the couple has and their severities. You obviously love and care for your partner, that doesn't mean it's healthy. The original info you gave sounded of desperation, this now sounds more like it's all financial, rather than disability related.

I suggested couples therapy in my previous response. Are either or both of you getting therapy individually for your mental health / physical issues? On medications? Have family or friends that can help?

I actively participated in growing up with both of my parents dealing with mental issues struggle through love, hatred, abuse, marriage and divorce, depression, grief, manipulation, neglect, bargaining, drug use, alcoholism, resentment, anxiety, animosity and progressively deteriorating health for nearly 40 years before cutting almost all contact with them both. They were soulmates and life partners too.

Now I struggle dealing with the aftermath after 53 years of being emotionally, mentally and physically abused. My wife has childhood trauma of her own, but no physical impairments. We make it work, but just barely. I am on 100% disability and do bi-weekly psychological therapy. I am in to see my specialists once a month for my physical issues.

We have gone through couples therapy multiple times and barely managed to avoid divorce twice in just over 23 years of being together and married for 16. If it wasn't for being lucky and getting approved for full disability we wouldn't have made it past our fifth year of marriage no matter how much we love and care for each other. It's just too much. 

Any of this sound familiar? I would like nothing more than for things to work out for you and wish you luck. I really do. But it's a crapshoot and two emotionally or mentally broken people rarely stay together in the end. The truth is the percentage is high that it will fail, but I would rather be honest with you than blow smoke up your ass or try and convince you that everything is unicorns and rainbows.
Honestly, none of that sounds familiar. We don't take it out on each other, we don't fight or use drugs to cope, we don't hurt each other. We also are a gay couple who doesn't want kids. So we aren't abusing or neglecting any kids. 

It's all connected, disability, financial, mental health. Because of disability and mental health, he's been having to take more time off work. Now my physical and mental health is getting so bad I have to take time off work. Our mental health is getting even worse due to financial stress and our failing bodies, 

I'm desperate to find a way for both of us to get the care we need and stay together, as well as be able to afford things like rent and groceries. 

As for your questions, we are doing our best. I have a therapy appointment next week (but I've been struggling to get that set up due to my therapist not having availability, so I'm about a month behind),  I've got a doctor's appointment to go over the migraine I've been having in 2 weeks, and an mri next month. My medication list is 3 pages long if you count non pill related things like needles, glucomoleter, inhaler, etc.  Healthcare is just sometimes sporadic and takes a while. He's got therapy next week, and I'm trying to urge him to see a doctor for his leg. We're doing thr best we can."

I had to put my whole life on hold. I had to pretty quickly go onto shots as a treatment option too because of medications for my mental health. They shots definitely helped a lot. I’m now on an infusion every three months instead which is a stronger version of the shots. 

Migraine is a lot to deal with. I definitely understand where you’re coming from."
p0083,Has anyone here suffered from MASSIVE imposter syndrome after being recognised as a disabled person?,28,disability,"I also have mental health conditions and constantly question myself. If other people with bipolar and generalized anxiety are out there thriving, it must be because I'm a phony and have to try harder.

I don't know how to get rid of these feelings but I relate 🫂"

p0085,My physical health is taking a massive toll on my mental health ,28,disability,"Have you been diagnosed with a medical condition? This sounds very much like the autoimmune neuromuscular disease that I have (Myasthenia Gravis).

Otherwise make sure you submit the information from the OB's office in writing. If they deny the claim, request a claim file, consult a lawyer in CA, and appeal on a timely basis."
p0087,would you consider an ED a (partially) physical disability?,21,disability,"I was on SSDI for my anorexia as an adult in my 20s for medical/physical reasons. not mental health. Got approved almost instantly. 

Now im 35 and no longer recovering-- have a SEED of 23 years now-- and on SSDI for completely different reasons (albeit probably caused in part by my ED, but I no longer tell medical providers about my ED and don't have a treatment team any longer).
Eating disorders are mental illnesses and they can lead to physical illnesses but I would not equate having anorexia to having Multiple Sclerosis. Feels like comparing apples to oranges in my opinion.
But I wouldn’t be so concerned what others consider a disability as in a lot of ways that’s subjective, what might be disabling for me might not really bother you. 

Reading this breaks my heart though , I’m praying that you’re in mental health care on a regular basis and that you have encouraging and supportive people around you. Focus on healing your mind so your body may follow.
Yeah, but applications for those things require way more than actually having a disability, you have to prove that it's disabling to the level that you cannot cater for a lot of things. Some mental illnesses can be classified as such, but most are not. Nonetheless, many discussions are addressing mental illnesses as disabilities.

The boundary you are trying to set between mental/physical is a bit hard as well, depression can impair your physical abilities, but it is pretty much on a cognitive level. EDs can make you physically weak/sick, but it is also pretty much about treating your mental condition. In my opinion, all mental disabilities can affect your physical health because we are not disconnected. In the same way, physical disabilities can impair your mental health."
