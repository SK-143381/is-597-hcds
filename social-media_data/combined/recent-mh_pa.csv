p0001,Taking the mystery out of traveling alone,28,Blind," This is great!
Have you had or will you get orientation and mobility lessons?"
p0002,Weight lifting is one of the best sport for people with a visual disability,37,Blind,"I agree.  With that said there are a few exercises I was curious about given I can't see videos and demonstrations.  If you were to explain to someone blind what is or how to do the skull crusher exercise how would you describe it?  Thanks in advance, hear this exercise is great.
For allthe people that talked about the fact that weight lifting is not recommanded for people with a glaucoma :

  
First of all yes, you should always ask your ophtalmologist before starting any new program/sport

  
I did that with two differents doctors and both told me that the small increase in the IOP due to the weight lifting/exersise wasn't something dangerous, that you can lift weight  without any issue but you should just try to avoid exersises where  you are on your head, so basically just the handstand push up in our case
Weight lifting alone could get boring, I speak from my experience. The best, in my opinion is to lift then use it in an active sport or marshal art. Every week you’ll feel stronger and more capable. For me, I lift 1 or 2 times a week and train BJJ twice a week. And do blind hockey on a biweekly basis on the weekends. I speak from my experience,  everyone is different.
Hey, I also have glaucoma and am quite into fitness.

I tried lifting weights for a while too, but i found it kind of boring. It is nice to get into, but it eventually gets boring when you realize the only thing you can do is put on more weights. Maybe that floats your boat, but I personally didn't find it fulfilling enough.

  
I started calisthenics though, and I have found so much more motivation to do my workouts. It feels so much more satisfying to learn how to do a skill like L-sit from the ground, toes to bar, pistol squat and pseudo planche pushup. Those are just kind of beginner moves, I want to progress into the even more cool ones. You do need a bar though, preferably one for pullups/hanging.

As for the people saying it is dangerous to do lifts due to spikes in IOP. I think there is definitely merit. I think the best way to keep yourself safer in that context is to never over-strain yourself (close your eyes tightly because it is too hard), always maintain your breathing, and of course never do handstands. That is the one thing that I really wish I could do is handstands, because the handstand pushups and presses are so cool.
Yes, weight lifting can cause IOP spikes. Aerobic exercise is more recommended for glaucoma/ocular hypertension.
Then the problem of going to a gym is finding someone that will go through the trouble of explaining new workouts well. IDK why but most people seem very shy and awkward doing that lol."
p0003,Handling Mean Comments About My Disability,48,Blind,"Aw you are really going through it.  Some crappy people are doing a very good job of making you feel like a laughingstock, which by the way you are not.  I know the school has responsibilities to encourage you to be independent, but they don't seem to have the full picture.  

I was resistant to starting to use a mobility cane myself, I was already anxious being in public and the cane made that feeling worse.  Like you, I've walked into things and smacked my head into immovable objects.  That ghot me thinking about the kinds of risks I now face in terms of personal injuries.  This became a more pressing concern after I hurt my shoulder walking into a bike I didn't know was there.    If I keep hitting my head, there's the possibility I could break my nose.  I personally like my nose the way it is, so I started making changes that dropped the opportunity for injuries.  Mishaps I was having one out of every ten times I did something, I worked to drop that to one out of every hundred times, or once every thousand times.  If I'm walking at speed and miss a curb, that can result in dental damage I'm similarly not interested in experiencing, same as with breaking my nose.  

Like I said, you're dealing with a huge amount of concerns and fears.  You're a teen, you're dealing with decreasing sight, and those are two scary things imo.  Has your school already opened a conversation of ways to accommodate your situation?  They will be concerned about students who have been left to fend for themselves the way you kind of are describing, they will be concerned if you are injured on their property and it's later revealed they dropped the ball and did not intervene with proven resources to help you.  

It's really great how you described the way you feel and what your experiences are.  That is a really good skill.  You raise a lot of really good points; maybe consider showing or sharing this post with one of your parental figures as a starting point?  It sounds like you underwent a lot of sight loss in a relatively short time; having gone through less sight loss than you, I found my brainpower took a big hit because all the formerly visual pathways needed to reroute the circuitry for the change in conditions.  If your school has learning support services, I would expect this is something they are trained to work with.

The people who are mean and enjoy punching down on others, they are a vocal minority, do your best to tune them out, they are really unimportant.  You will meet plenty of people who are impressed with your strength and resilience.  You also may grab the attention of the adult version of the folks who like punching down on others; let your expeirences with them in school help further temper your risk assessment.
1) You need to confront the people responsible head-on. I was bullied in grade school (for something other than blindness). I finally “snapped” one day and shouted “Stop it!  You think it’s cool to pick on me because I can’t defend myself?!”  I said it LOUD. Everyone in the cafeteria stopped talking and looked over. It definitely got the teachers’ attention and they had to acknowledge there was a problem. 
2) Report the issue to the teachers and staff. Part of their job is to keep you safe. 
3) Work on building your confidence and poise. If your body language screams “victim” you will be victimized. If you can, participate in a sport or marshal arts. It will improve the way you carry yourself and balance."
p0004,I'm trying to locate a physical calendar that can read aloud,3,Blind,"i’m completely blind, I live by myself, I use my phone as a calendar, and my Alexa, because I also have to set reminders in my Alexa, so I can make sure I call from my Transportation for pair of transit, for my doctors appointment, on the days I’m supposed to call for them. It’s really wonderful. I am 64 years young."
p0005,Anyone move to somewhere for public transit?,30,Blind,"I have RP and so does my cousin. I strictly live in large cities with public transport and would never live anywhere I couldn’t get around myself. I am comfortable with the cane at night when needed. I am very much happy being independent but do rely on others for certain things. 

Conversely, my cousin also has RP and lives in a rural area close to family. He is not happy and often finds himself frustrated by having to rely on others for almost everything. He doesn’t seem as happy and doesn’t know how to use the cane.
I fully moved countries for the public transportation.  Although originally I was interested in the country I'm living in for other reasons, what changed my mind about staying permanently rather than come for short visits was the freedom I found here that I had never experienced before.  

To be fair though, I couldn't say I really *fully* enjoyed living in the US because, y'know, I was never going to be able to live independently.
Following this thread, wondering the same thing as I plan to move soon due to vision loss and want to maintain independence through public transportation 
I also have RP, and post-undergraduate degree have lived multiple places where having public transportation/walkability was one of my top priorities. My position is different than yours, as I was legally blind by 18 and had to make these decisions as a young adult rather than an established adult with working vision, but from my experience, I would absolutely recommend moving somewhere/living somewhere with public transportation that  allows you to be as autonomous as possible. I would never consider moving somewhere where I can’t be independent and navigate, at this point in my life
Paratransit in some progressive cities are getting better when they utilize the micro transit services sometimes offered by third-party, subcontracted programs that are not the clunky short buses they pick you up within a 30 minute window and then you can be on the bus for up to 60 minutes each way. Again, the micro transit would be a city where UZURV or via transportation operates.
This is a deeply personal decision! I am totally blind and have had made every choice about where I live based on public transportation. I live in a big city and bought a condo less than a block walking from the nearest subway stop. For me, paratransit is not really a functional option Because it is so unreliable and can take so long   Also, for what it's worth I find it easier to make friends in big cities because there are just so many people around
Where are these places y’all live with public transportation and walkable places? I’m in the same position and trying to move.
Have you reached out to a local blind organization? Maybe they will have strict strategies in orientation and mobility for navigating your specific area. I cannot promise you strategies will work for you/be affective but they would be the best people to ask. Especially because I bet you are not the only blind person in your area to have that same kind of issue
I live in Massachusetts in a suburb of Boston. There's decent public transportation and Boston is a pretty walkable city. Many of the suburbs have commuter rails and busses, and all public transportation is free for the blind. I also get subsidized $40/day in Uber or Lyft rides, if I need it. This is all through the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. I am very recently legally blind so I haven't actually utilized some of the benefits yet. I just got an electric bike and that's been really helpful. The only setback is that it's a HCOL area.
I also have RP, and grew up in a very rural area. I feel for your cousin, after growing up I immediately moved to areas that are walkable and have public transportation/are more urban, and have a much higher quality of life. Rural living can be challenging for anyone, but from my experience it’s just not feasible for anyone who is blind/low vision.
> Rural living can be challenging for anyone, but from my experience it’s just not feasible for anyone who is blind/low vision.

I am in my 40s and have never been able to drive. Since becoming an adult I have spent half my time in a large suburban town with no public transport and half my time in a small rural town with no public transport. If I had to choose I would say the rural town was better. It was walkable and had bike lanes and sidewalks and people I knew that would give me a lift in the pouring rain. The suburan town had no sidewalks, no bike lanes, and everything was miles apart.

For the first time in my life I have access to public transit and I still want to cry with happiness everytime I can choose to go somewhere and really be independent but it's still a limited service that doesn't give me the same freedom as a large metropolitan transit service.

I think that we are less limited by geography an more limited by car centric locations and lack of full services and lack of connected communities."
p0006,"Visually impaired and losing sight - MO, US",10,Blind,"if you were declared legally blind by your state. Your first step should be contact department of Blind services in your county, they will then turn you case to let’s say maybe lighthouse or something similar like that where they do classes to teach independence for the blind, and they could assist you with mobility training, the way that you specifically would need it. That’s where I suggest you start. It is just my opinion. I’ll be praying."
p0007,What the hell am i?,33,Blind,"I agree with everybody else. I am blind, I have no usable vision whatsoever in my eyes. The right eyesight is gone, from a stroke when I was but say about seven years ago, I’m 64. I have a four multiple brain aneurysms, my eyesight has slowly been going for over 40 years. I am now I am blind, I live by myself, I take mobility lessons to walk back-and-forth to the stores, I can walk back-and-forth to the post office. your best bet is to contact the division of Blind service, make sure you have paperwork from the eye doctor, and they will start helping you, look for places that you can go for independent living, braille, most of all mobility training. Whether I’m blind or not, I love my life. I wouldn’t change it for a minute."
p0008,Am I holding my visually impaired younger brother back?,15,Blind,"When you are in the workforce as a blind person, unless you are working  from home, you need a good amount of determination.

Between having to make adjustments any time something changes in the place, staying on top of transportation, and all the other BS, there is a lot of extra effort we make.

Unless you got the determination and a set of clear goals that you want for yourself, a sustained career of any sort is pretty unlikely.

You and your mom are talking about your brother like you are discussing how to place the new couch in the living room.

I am sorry to say that if you are at the point of asking others for help with your brother's direction in life and it does not occur to you to think of his opinion one time while writing  the post, then neither piece of advice is gonna do anything for him."
p0009,Learning to use a cane before O&M,12,Blind,"if you would like to talk about how to use a cane before, you actually get orientation and mobility training, send me a private message, and I can try and help you out."
p0010,"I need help.  Blind since birth, 55F, alone, need a reason.  My life has been pointless.  Not suicidal, just alone, grieving, kinda rich, confused, no kids, I live very rural, and I'm just out of ideas on what to do with my meaningless life.",9,Blind,"Move to a city. You say you got the money for it so go for it, buy a place, then you can perhaps look into these blind organisations in America, then maybe sports, you could try rock climbing, cooking, force yourself to go to events youmay not  want to, put it this way, you can sit and be sad  in your house, or you can get out off of  your arse and try and live.
 I’ve been completely blind, my entire life, might I suggest learning to do things non-visually, because I feel like you’re limiting yourself by the small amount of vision that you do have. I know you mentioned you don’t like gardening, but have you thought of doing things like, making your own jams? I do think some therapy might help, just to help out with the grieving. I too lost a parent. The reason why I say learn to do things non-visually is because I am completely blind, and I have done plenty of sports in my life, as well as dance, and a few other things that you mentioned that you said blind people couldn’t do.   a change of location might do you some good. It will give you a fresh start, and it certainly helped me when I lost my parent at the age of 19. Perhaps take up some thing like cooking or baking? Origami is also very interesting, you can get into LEGO building, all these things are accessible for blind people nowadays. In fact, there’s a whole world of accessible things for blind people nowadays.  You’re never too old to go back to school.   Also, what’s this about having a rich man to support you? I want one of those? Ha ha… Seriously was that  something your parents told you you needed?
Maybe you can try an AirBNB in a few different cities and see if you like any of them? I don’t know what the lower age limit is, but there are pretty awesome bus tours set up for retirees that take you all around the country. Might be a way to travel and meet new people. I can appreciate that it might feel too hard to leave given how many animals you have, but maypbe you can use that money to hire someone you trust to look after them.

There are also some organizations that do blind events, like my relative who did blind golfing and glind skiing. I myself don’t have the money to go do a specialized trip like this for blind people, but this sort of adventure does exist out there for us. 

The loneliness and the high value you put on being with people in real life really stands out from what you wrote. It would be uncomfortable at first, but maybe you can find some achievable goals on the path toward including more people in your life. This sort of thing doesn’t pay off right away, but you have time to include more people in your life, maybe through travel or relocation. Maybe you can afford to have a house in town and one in the country. You could alternate lifestyles. There is a lot more occupationsl therapy and mobility training in town centers if that’s an issue. I love the app “voicevista” for exploring new places. It even tells me when there’s a drinking fountain nearby, and identifies a lot of the buildings and parks that I’m passing.

I’d say a goal in my life is to do enough things that I have crazy stories to tell afterward. I have social anxiety, but sometimes this goal is enough to get me out of the house."
p0011,Is there technology that can help us learn how to dance?,3,Blind,"I would say this is a very good opportunity to talk to your friends, see if anyone is interested in teaching. Further, a quick dancing lesson from a professional can help allot provided they understand your requirement correctly.

No tech product can come closer to that feeling of dancing with someone, enjoying the moment, the human touch.

I did think about GPT 4O, but it is yet to be in consumer's hands, and I wouldn't suggest doing any physical activity with that thing just yet, getting injured is a high probability. Look up GPT 4O on Google if you don't know what it is. It was announced on May 13th 2024."
p0012,What is your mission in life?,6,Blind,"As someone who loves languages, math, and puzzles, I’ve found learning braille to be really rewarding (after a learning curve at the start). I had a bit of vision left and was able to memorize the characters visually very quickly, but it took a while for my fingertips to re-wire. Anyway, I think just having something that I’m gaining, instead of everything that I’m losing or that’s getting harder, has helped lift a bit of depression that had the world and all my goals cast in a shadow.

Braille displays also have their own word processors so I’m hoping that will help me as I edit a novel I wrote.

I get what you’re saying, though. I too have a job that was more interesting to me when I could just sail through it. Now I think about quitting every day. I find it so stressful to use screenreaders on a laptop, but I find voiceover with an Ipad to be ok for somethings. I like how I can use gestures instead of memorizing a million key combinations that you can‘t even perform properly with fingers at home position. (For example, control and the letter “q“ at the same time to exit NVDA, when both of these buttons are used with the left pinkie finger. If only I had two left pinkie fingers, I guess.)

Anyway, a lot of  blind coders use braille to code. I find that braille activates my visual cortex and I sort of see the words I’m reading. Maybe that would be more rewarding for you.

If you are patient and enjoy teaching, you could look into joining an assistive tech service (probably state occupational services) for the blind. Then you’d have motivation to learn the tools since you’d be teaching them to others. As I’ve met more and more older blind people, I find that there are many who haven’t gotten very far with learning to use phones or computers and could really get some functionality back just learning and practicing the basics like emailing and texting and being able to chagne the speaking rate and turn the screen reader off and on. I enjoy teaching an older friend how to use voiceover on her phone, but it does take a lot of patience and repetition. 

I love exercise and I’m looking to get a guide dog that the trainer has agreed to teach to run. It‘s a small company though, and they might not have all the dogs for the demand. 

I do a bit of running independently with a white cane and high-mileage roller ball tip. I also am getting back into practicing soccer with a bell-ball. Exercise does help with the dark haze of depression that I”m always fighting off. It doesn’t quite lift it enough for me to want to try hard at work though. Maybe I just need another job for that.
Keep your options open for OSes. Having both Windows and Mac machines, or a dual-boot Mac is a good choice. Some time ago my work machine was a dual-boot MacBook since I was developing for Windows and for Mac at the same job.

For writing, consider using a dictation app and then having the recording converted to text. I'm sighted, but I use speech to text regularly, especially when I'm walking or driving a familiar route. 

For OS control there's a new app called Cephable you might want to check out. Just a week and a half I attended a conference where Cephable presented, and it looks like the software could fill in the gaps not address by JAWS and NVDA. During a short chat with the founder I asked if the software could be adapted to find and dismiss modal dialogs, and he said it could, though it's unclear to me whether that would entail additional work. In the presentation he mostly emphasized accessibility for people with limited mobility. At some point I'll create a post about it. 

MIght I try to convince you to reconsider coding? Software management and project management are options, but ticket trackers are a mixed bag when it comes to accessibility. My team and I settled on Jira but needed to tweak it. If the key barrier to keeping and maintaining an interest in coding is accessibility, then that's something we could discuss."
p0013,What do you guys do forexercise?  ,14,Blind,"I used to go on very long – as in 6-8 miles long – guide dog walks. I’d just start off somewhere, drop a waypoint in my GPS app and walk. We’d often get lost, but that was the idea.

Sadly the dog got older and I got a lung disease. It got to the point where bending down to pick something up from the ground caused me to need to sit for a while, which was dreadful.
Now I use an exercise bike; I either make a playlist of songs for a set timed workout, or my book player can pause between chapters, so I look at the timings of those and tend to go time over distance. Sometimes I will use my Fitbit when cycling to compete with my family, particularly if my daughter’s doing some other sort of sporting activity.

I play tennis once a week, swim when I can, walk the dogs, and that’s about it really. I have no desire to be overly buff and nobody to buddy with at a gym anyway, so I just have to take things as they are. I average about 10,000 steps a day, although on a quiet workday that’ll be 4,000 and during a cycling session it might hit 12,500 or something. I also tend to pace about a lot to think or when I’m on a phone call or meeting where I don’t need to type; I’ve done at least a mile just going round and round my garden.
There’s usually tons of camps for blind kids in the summer. I wish tgere were more for adults haha. 

I try to walk and do my physical therapy exercises but I’m pretty cooped up and sedentary myself.
I mostly work out at home with a Nintendo Switch game called Ring Fit Adventure, which I started using before I went blind. It is a fantastic fitness game with a wide range of workout options, and I loved it until my vision loss started.

However, its visual accessibility is on par with your average video game produced in 2018, so… not great. I can still do it because I learned all the moves with normal vision, but I have a lot of problems with obstacles that I can’t see anymore, and it gets harder and harder as my vision loss continues to progress slowly.

I have been thinking about getting a stationary bike and listening to audiobooks while I cycle.
Primarily weight lifting and walking. I dearly miss cycling (tandem is not an equivalent). 

I've both a home gym and gym membership down the road, but primarily workout at home. Absolutely *love* weight lifting.
As someone else mentioned there are lots of camps and organized things for kids, at least there are here in Michigan, I'd be happy to recommend some specific ones if you happen to here.  

I am visually impaired and my duaghter is blind but we are very active reguardless.    We both run, bike, swim, ski (downhill and cross country), kayak and lots more.  We use a combination of different strategies to make things work for us, its all totally possible.   If anyone wants to talk about specific activities I'd be happy to talk.  

Specifically for workouts / training there is an app called Revision Fitness that was developed specifically for blind users.  It's great.  The person who started is a blind Paralympic athlete so he know his stuff.
Our local blind club is looking to get a swishboard. It’s sort of a mix between ping-pong and air hockey, and there is a blinder in the middle so that sighted people can play with blind people without having to wear a blindfold.

If you live in a big place, you might look into goalball. It’s an indoor soccer-like game made for blind people and all the sighted ones wear blindfolds.

  
I go on long walks every day, and when the path is empty, I run for portions using my white cane. I also have to do a lot of stretch band exercises for a surgery rehab.

In the pool, I often do water jogging with one of those floaty belts that people use in water aerobics. You can get a pretty good workout without moving forward all that quickly. That gives people time to get out of my way. (I don’t do this in lanes, but in the open swim area. If I get an empty lane all to myself, I’ll mix this with regular swimming.)

I’ve been riding a tandem bike, and it’s alright. I also go paddleboarding, but almost always with a sighted person. 

I have lived in one place where there was a group that offered sighted guides for exercise for blind people. I don’t live in the right part of Australia, but there are a few places with organisations dedicated to helping blind people do sport.

Maybe start by looking up if there is swishboard or goalball in your area.
I do have some vision.

I like to ice skate, and I used to go once a week until I broke my arm last year (I'm. A little scared to go again haha). A couple of months ago, I got a tricycle, and it's been really great. There's a bike path along the beach near my house. I got it because you need to go fast on a bike to stay balanced - too fast for me to be able to see. So the trike is really nice because I'm balanced and I can go as fast or slow as I need to. It's so much more fun than walking  I'm thinking of making a vest to let others know I have low vision, since I can't have my cane out obviously haha 

Before I got it, I was also looking into getting a tandem bike. They have places where you can rent them for an our or so! My dad took me to this park in the city, and he rode in the front, steering us, and the only thing I had to worry about was pedalling. It was pretty fun, but those bikes are EXPENSIVE...

I dont know if those options are suitable for you, though. There ARE blind sports, and maybe there are groups in your area! My favourite is goalball. Not sure how exercise-y it is, but I thought I'd put it out there haha.

It can be so hard to find a way to exercise that's accessible as a blind/visually impaired person and fun... good luck, I hope you find something you enjoy!
Outside - I enjoy walking when someone is able to accompany me and lend an arm. 

Inside - I enjoy Yoga and Pilates using videos from YouTube that are descriptive (some instructors are better verbally than others). I also LOVE trampolining, I purchased a Bellicon for in my home (I think that is how you spell it) it has a bar on the front, also you can pay a subscription for videos that I do intermittently. It is amazing how many exercises/stretches you can do just using a trampoline also, it is very versatile. Occasionally I enjoy a skipping rope in the sunshine too. 

I hope this helps or at least puts some ideas out there…."
p0014,I don't understand the concept of dancing.,30,Blind,"I have been a ballet dancer for quite a few years now. When I began dancing, there was an initial period where I did find the concepts of dance movements to be a bit abstract and hard to comprehend as an observer because of my visual impairment. However, the more I danced, the more I was able to appreciate the physical aspects of dance and all of its subtle nuances because I had an easier time relating to it from personal experience that I had gained as a dancer. Dance is a form of communication for me. It's about expressing who I am and how I am feeling emotionally, mentally, and physically. It also improves my physical and mental state of being. I love how it feels! When I started dancing, much of my training was very hands-on, and my teachers did have to show me how to place my body into positions. Verbal descriptions helped me as well, especially because ballet is so structured and has set terminology for each and every step and direction of the head, shoulders and body. Ballet even has terminology for the quality of movements (in other words, how a movement is supposed to be performed in order to convey a certain quality or artistic element). Because ballet is so structured and is based upon foundations that you work up to more advanced movements and steps from, it's easier to comprehend how a step should be performed when you have a basic idea of how your body should move in space based on the style of dance you are doing. As I progressed through my training to more advanced levels, I could listen to my teacher give an exercise combination and be able to perform it without having to be shown because I knew how to move my body and I knew which direction to move. There are unfortunately times when I still struggle as  a visually  impaired dancer, however. Creating a mental map of the environment and  navigating it in a patterned, planned fashion without getting disoriented can be a challenge at times. I don't care though. I still dance. To conclude, dance is often a rather visual art form, so I can certainly see how a non-dancer, or even someone who is just new to dance might have a harder time relating to it. Although dance can be quite visual in nature, if you choose a style of dance based upon who you are as a person and really immerse yourself in its history, movements, steps, evolution, music, and its different styles, you can learn to appreciate it in your own way. For example, I love the sound of pointe shoes as ballet dancers move across the stage or studio floor, I love the smell of the pointe shoes, I love the music, the atmosphere, the perfectly timed, precise movements, the history, and I love being a part of it all. Dance is a very poignant, sensory experience for me, and it's a big part of who I am as a person. I love dance! Sorry for my dancer rant! I'll stop now. I hope this is helpful.
I’m really impressed by the thoughtful series of answers you received to your question, OP.

I do a variety of social/partner dance styles and have dabbled in some solo dances like ballet. For the partner dancing, I love the physical movements in time to the music, but also finding new ways to respond to the music and the movements of my partner. There’s a give-and-take to the inertia and the movements that gives a visceral satisfaction. I also improved my physical fitness significantly when I started dancing regularly. 

One of the styles I love is called contra dancing. It’s a traditional dance form that requires sets of partners arranged in a line. They then perform a dance choreographed by a caller. The dancers perform the dance sequence in each set before progressing on to the next set to repeat the same choreography. One of the reasons that I particularly enjoy this style is what I think of as the puzzle factor. Each dance could be described as a new set of sequences that get you from one end of the room to the other, but there’s a lot of creativity that can be involved in how you get there. There’s also a lot of social fun to be had along the way; community, togetherness, laughing at our mistakes, enjoying friendship.

For ballet, I fell in love with the minute efforts that go in to mastering a dance sequence. Like any art form, it requires a great deal of practice and concentration. I found a completely new understanding of how my body worked through learning to make it do new things.

Thank you for sharing your question.
So I am completely blind, the only types of dancing I enjoy are tap dancing or like clog dancing. My suggestion to you is what if you found described video versions of old musicals and watched those to get an idea of that dancing style since you used to watch musicals live with your mom? 

I know I will never fully understand dancing, I do like the metaphor of music for your eyes. My sister studied dance when she was young so had to sit through a few recitals with no idea what was going on. 

But then again there are several things which I will never understand. I rarely get enjoyment over sports, I will never see paintings, and I only know some about the art of dance. But I once went to a production of the Nutcracker Suite ballet just to listen to the music while my friends enjoyed the dance and music, and did not feel like I only got half the experience."
p0015,Am I being too sensitive?,35,Blind,"She will crush your soul at some point,  I’ve been there and I divorced her. 
There’s only so much judgement and gaslighting a person can take. 

The work thing I understand,  it’s exhausting.

At night I use a mobility cane and I’m at the point, maybe beyond the point where I want to roar with anger at people interrupting me, turning their cars around to see if I need help.  I’ve been followed in my neighbourhood by a woman yelling at me I was walking the wrong way, when I was walking to a friends house. She was yelling and yelling at me.  She obviously knew where I lived.   
I have had a cop damage my retinas and accuse me of lying about my vision and refusing to take a spotlight out of my eyes, and getting hostile I was covering my eyes. 
I had a security car pull up on the footpath in front of me and demanding to know why I was walking alone on a street.  I wasn’t even near their business.  

It sucks… people don’t know when to bite their tongues. "
p0016,My partner is going blind at 30,17,Blind,"Has she had any kind of skills training? She's going to need orientation and mobility, Braille, assistive technology, and other life skills training to be able to function independently.  

If you're in the US, you need to contact your state's department of vocational rehabilitation to see about getting her enrolled in training. There are some immersive training programs that blindfold all participants, and get people functioning without sight pretty quickly. 

Blind people can be parents - I know a blind woman who has raised 4 kids, including one with autism. She does everything that any mother does, except drive. I also know a couple of blind women who raised children as single parents. It's hard - parenting in general is hard, and parenting with a disability is even harder - but it certainly can be done, and done well. If she doesn't have independent living skills though, she's not ready to be a parent. She needs to be able to take care of herself first. 

We also can have educations and careers. I'm 2 semesters away from completing my masters in computer science, and I work as an accessibility test engineer. Blind teachers also exist, and not just in schools for the blind. (Although teachers are quitting right and left at present.) 

Her world definitely doesn't have to shrink down to YouTube videos, but she's going to have to do the work to learn new skills. 

You should be aware that a lot of people who are losing sight show resistance to learning those skills at first. They tend to go through the stages of grief - denial, anger, depression, etc. So if she fights you at first on mobility training, Braille, etc. - that doesn't say anything about her as a person. It's a very common response.
I’m sorry, but as someone who plays video games, saying many are blind accessible is not true.

If you’re saying many might be accessible if you’re visually impaired, I wouldn’t know, but completely blind, no.

There are some that are accessible, on the PS5 there’s the last of us series,  God of war, although that isn’t fully accessible, mortal kombat 1, And one or two more,  I’ve missed.  The Xbox 360 I think it is? The latest one? Has Forza motorsports.  There are some games on steam that are accessible, but the unfortunate reality is tons of games aren’t accessible to us.

Personally, if you’re gonna go for a games console, I’d go for a PS5, it has the best screen reader in my opinion, although I haven’t tried an Xbox but there seems to be a couple more games on the PS5 anyway."
p0017,Failed attempts to overcome my vision/hearing disabilities and improve my life,11,Blind,"What about trying to look into hearing aids/cochlea implants? Someone else who is way more knowledgeable on This has already mentioned stuff here so that’s all I’ll  say on that.

As hard as it is, we’ve got to get off our arses and advocate for ourselves because no one else wi do it for us.

so look into hearing aids and see if you can get some grants or something and then maybe you could look into mobility/ o and m training to get outside more."
p0018,Life After High School Advice,5,Blind,"Get with his local state agency for the blind or his Lighthouse for the blind and they can help get him the services he needs to become a successful independent visually impaired adult.  Depending on his state, he might have a school for the blind that he can attend where they will teach him independent life, skills, and orientation and mobility skills plus things like reading, braille, and accessible technology for the visually impaired.  If you get a referral from your state agency for the blind, or the Lighthouse for the blind, most of the schools for blind individuals are free.

How good is he at using a computer, a tablet and a phone on his own knowing that he’s fully blind?  For all those devices, the screen, reader, software is free and built-in to the phone in the tablet and for the computer it’s also free and offers a lot of support for visually impaired and blind people.  Getting used to the screen reader on his phone is key because that’ll help him understand and be able to navigate screen readers, and what he would want to do for the future is get very comfortable with using the screen reader on a computer.  I know I mentioned the tablet and I don’t think the tablets too important, but just keep in mind that’s gonna be pretty much the same experience as using the screen reader on his phone so that’s not necessarily important as long as he has a decent phone, that’s he can use.  Just being honest here, but the Google pixel phones on the android side of things, and pretty much all the iPhones on the Apple side of things are super accessible when it comes to accessibility and their screen readers.

The NFB or the national Federation for the blind, will give them a free cane once a year, so you might want to get him signed up for one of those. That way he can learn to use it and become way more independent and be able just to walk outside safely and efficiently, if you so desires,.  Normally your state agency for the blind or the Lighthouse for the blind can assigned a orientation and mobility specialist to teach you how to use a cane, but I do know and rule situations it’s kind of hard to get one of those people out there.  If he manages to attend the school for the blind, which we pretty much all would recommend he does, they would teach him orientation and mobility skills there.

So yes, from afar, those are the two major things you can do for him is just make sure he has a decent, smart phone and he knows how to use it and it’s very proficient at using it and also he has access to a cane that he can use to travel And learn to become more independent one just being able to walk around on his own.  There are a few videos on YouTube, which you can listen to on teaching somebody how to use a white cane to help navigate but again the best thing to do is get them somebody in person to teach him.

I think that’s a good starting point and please let us know if you have any further questions.  Finding work as a visually impaired or blind person is very very very very difficult but it’s doable with a bit of effort.  He should just make sure he’s fully comfortable with using a computer blind

p0019,"Need advice. Struggling with studies, finding work, and life in general. (Also vent/rant)",6,Blind,"I can't help you much with most of your questions, except to wish you well and all the best, and it's a tough slog ahead.

a few things/ tips, might be totally wrong, so take them with a grain of sault.

Don't rely on your vision, use it as an extra pare of hands as it were when necessary, and instead of using read aloud, start using screen readers for both the PC and mobile. The sooner you do this, the better off you will be in the long run, could also give magnifiers a go, should they be of any help with the amount of vision you have.

Unfortunately, whilst screen readers do work with pdfs, and do not necessarily need to be converted to word, the flowcharts and tabular information is often screwed up. Don't rely on what your uni is teaching you, just see the topics they have, and learn them online through edx, khan acadimy and so on.

 The content will still likely be visual, but there are alternates to learning those or try and gain understanding through context/ other books materials.

&#x200B;

Studying offline is always a better idea, there's a slight chance you'll end up making friends there which will help a lot, but again a greater chance of you just ending up alone and ignored.

Expecting accessibility accommodation's from any uni in India is like expecting politicians to be saints, so you have to have work arounds for most things and most expenses are out of pocket for any and all assistive tech/ help that you might need/ require.

They do allow you writers for exams though, people who read the questions to you and will write what you say( don't get me started on how horrifyingly bad and or wrong this can and does go at times), although now they might also allow you to take your exams on a pc with a screen reader and or magnifier.

&#x200B;

When it comes to mobility and going anywhere alone in India,

Forget walking on the roads, it mostly consists of walking about and asking for help from people to get to where you want to go. to be fair the People in Mumbai are lovely, but asking for help of any kind has always been very difficult for me, at least.

Uber and such help a bit with mobility though, as long as you can afford it.

&#x200B;

Organizations in India to help the visually impaired or those going through vision loss do exist, but they are most often than not toxic, very rude and very likely of not much help unless you can politic with the best of them, in which case there might be some hope.

There's NAB (Has different state branches), TTI( in Pune), AICB and so on.

[eyeway.org](https://eyeway.org) is a decent resource for a list of organizations and a number where you can call and take help? from a counselor for the type of questions you have.

Hope this helps.
Hi, hope you are doing well, I have lived in India my entire life, recently moved to Australia, but I can tell you that I shared same sentiments as you while I was there.

  
For context I have ROP and Amblyopia and extreme myopia I don't know if it's as bad as your situation but I pretty much can't see from one eye and have very bad vision in my working eye.  
Now with the issues.  
Colleges in India are absolutely crap when it comes to accessibility and I realised it now after coming to Australia, one semester I spent at college in India 10 years ago was nightmare and I pretty much had to drop out cause I couldn’t understand anything in class I often got bored and left the class cause I couldn’t see the board or projector and teachers never uploaded lecture files on the learning platform, same problem with books as well I didn’t know much about screen readers back then so never used them.  
Just like you I always felt very lonely in India most of my adult life cause most of my existing friends moved out and making friends was really difficult, I couldn’t find any local groups or anything either, I did make an discord server before but that server is now dead but you can join discord server of this sub reddit of which I am a part of as well and it’s a chill place.   
For physical activity since my doctor told me not to lift heavy weights I resorted to walking that too mostly inside my house cause I can’t see much in night time.  
Now about going out and stuff I used UBER and OLA a lot but I know it’s not the most affordable options.  
in recent years right before I moved here I used swiggy for pretty much everything from ordering groceries to send stuff to people’s houses again depends on availability, I used Urban company for getting haircuts etc.  
If you don’t already have UDID get one it’s important.  
now the job part,  
I am fortunate enough to have a family business, but after dropping out of college I learned web development and started freelancing I didn’t make substantial income but it was better than not making anything, since I want to have good financial future I started inventing at very young age as well.  
I am not sure how much this reply helped you but hope you feel better feel free to message me cheers."

He could never get over the ""shame"" of me not being a sportsball champ when I was 6. 

But the funny thing is it is all him projecting. He is the king of making medical excuses. He has claimed to have many maladies and conditions so he can get out of doing things he detests. He claimed he had ""da shits"" once so he could avoid taking Mom to a doctor's appointment. He claimed he caught it off a child. The child was lactose intolerant. Yes, he claimed he caught being lactose intolerant. It was just a lie. He is so used to lying he assumes everyone else does it as well. So I would be screamed at all the time. He would assume I was just putting on an act.
Use it, if he starts yelling, oh well. Tell him to get over it because you need to use this aid and it is not his life.

The more you use it, the better you’ll be for the future. You know what, get mobility training, and tell them what he’s saying in front of him, and see what happens then because they won’t take shit from him."

This is going to be long and please forgive me if you have been there done that but maybe if I share it will help if not just disregard it 😊

Have you had genetic testing? I assume you have because you are soo frustrated with testing but at the same time in my experience I thought all the tests had been done but at the same time there is more value to having the right people interpret those tests. I’ll share my experience with my son and if you’ve done all this I still think you are valid and I don’t want to give unsolicited advice or disregard your frustration.

But It might help if you have not?

My son has a disease that is so rare they call it an orphan disease. Even though it is genetic it is recessive and there is no family history on his father or my side of the family because it is recessive. It also wasn’t even properly correlated to a gene until one year before my son was tested at 2 so 8 years! Meaning if you had genetic testing more than 8 years ago there may be newly discovered things to test for.

My sons disease causes the retina to “not work” but the retinal imaging shows as you said “immaculate” retinas. 

There is no evidence of any damage or dysfunction in his eyes and the disease actual is more dangerous to his kidneys though they are stable now and also not damaged.

I’m not sayin you have the same thing as him but some of the “best” eye specialists were the most pompous dismissive assholes when he was a baby and I was trying to find out what was goin on.

In fact I knew he was blind when I gave birth to him I just knew even though his eyes “looked” typical.

I stupidly assumed doctors would be interested and yet I was totally lied to and in fact made to feel crazy the first year of his life because there was no “evidence” even his dad didn’t believe me til he wasn’t making eye contact at 6 months and still maintained that “maybe it’s cataracts but he looked at me when he was born” 
My ex was caught up in himself and ego. So no he didn’t look at him or me (the mom who he would have look at the most when born) he even had trouble breastfeeding because of it…because he can’t fuckin see!

I was blamed for this as well ! doctors can be so divorced from their patients experiences.

 He has light perception that is it nothing else he has never seen my face.

However when we did get the genetic results he ended up being recorded into the NIH as being the “first recorded” to have this who is ALSO blind from birth.

Usually it seems in the cases they have studied about this disease, kids are born with normal vision and there is no indication of an issue. It’s degenerative in nature so everyone they have on record before my kid usually starts to have issues with one eye onset anywhere from 5-18 years of age on average and it usually presents in one eye first and the other much much later. So obviously they don’t know shit about it if my son presents totally different.

So real long way of sayin as someone whose gone through the doctors gaslighting me about what “I know” because they can’t or won’t accept how little “they know” about is excruciating. 

I can’t imagine dealin with it from the perspective of being the one with vision issue. 

I am so so sorry. You are not in the wrong to be at your wits end. I hope you know your experience is valid no matter what some jerk who is also a doctor says to you.

I did not mean to scare you by suggesting genetic testing but I also know how different these things can present and my son only got a doctor who is his advocate and listens to me once I had genetic tests done because as you said “must be faking there is no damage”.

So ruling that part out might show a path to understanding and proper care. Once he started seeing doctors at CHOP in Philly I legitimately wanted to go beat the shit out of everyone in my state my son has been seen by who called themselves a fucking doctor. 

The difference in treatment was staggering. 

Perhaps reach out to them? Even though they are a children’s hospital they see adults because of how much research they do on visual impairments. It felt a lot more comfortable to deal with doctors being so open to how much they don’t know about the eye. So the team there would not be the type to say “you are faking” and just dismiss you.

He also had his vision tested in an intensive way you might benefit from. 

Over the course of a week (and now once a year since) he had MRI, cat scans, ultrasounds, macular photographs, retinal imaging, orientation  and mobility aptitude tests where a sort of “safe” obstacle course is traversed by the patient at different times in their day and different light settings,a bunch of other stuff too. 

The results are then all combined and looked at over the course of a month or two after you leave then they speak to you about findings and recommendations. Then you continue to have this stuff monitored. 

There was a woman there who actually had never known it was not typical to have clouded depth perception and had assumed everyone had the same experience until she brought her child in for issues w his eyes. 

It broke my heart to hear how dismissed she had been most of her life when she ever did bring it up with a doctor.

I hope you get the answers and validation and care that you deserve. You sound like you need some piece of mind and care and I hope I can give a little of that to you right now 🤗

It seems like you have really tried to build a good life for yourself regardless of the difficulties but it seems less about lack of vision and more about the stress from the unknown and lack of care from the people who are supposed to care about these things.

I wish you the best and I hope you are more gentle with yourself. It’s really not your fault and yet seems like you’ve been shamed enough by doctors to almost feel as though it is.

That is not ok and you don’t deserve that type of “non” treatment. Wishing you the best of outcomes as you seek answers, and don’t let some jerks who happen to have a medical degree stop you from demanding proper care and an answer to what is happening with your vision.

❤️🤗

I've had them before, but it's been a while. I was supposed to see an optaneurologist in a city an hour away, but never made it in because of transportation issues. I'm getting another referral to the doctor next month, and I'll hike there if I have to."
p0026,"tips for when you don't ""look blind"" in public?",19,Blind,Yeah of course the best way is having a white cane. They have short ones that are not for actual orientation and mobility called identity canes that are smaller and will help let people know that you can't see. I'm in the same boat as you and I don't look blind either. Sometimes I close my eyes And keep them closed which always makes people wonder why would he do that and then they noticed my white cane and they don't ask anymore questions about the obvious situation. I've tried wearing dark sunglasses but I live in a hot place so my face is always getting sweaty and who likes that? I use a long white cane which is pretty big and hard to miss especially in crowds as the handle sticks up above my shoulder and people behind me can see that I have the white cane so they don't try to push past me when I'm in line or walking in a group. There are options to get free white canes but I guess it depends where you live. Good luck
p0027,"For those of you who don’t know, you can use an apple Magic Keyboard on your iOS device",10,Blind,"What i meant by the layout is the form factor of the board. Having the function layer but missing out on all the less useful parts of the full sized keyboards like a numpad and other such things. I use the laptop layout on nvda even with a full board because I just prefer most hotkeys to be within arms reach. So I am basically saying that I prefer the 75% layout of the apple keyboard over other layouts like 60%, full sized, TKL, 65%, etc. It is also very lightweight and easy to transport. Sure, I probably could have found something cheaper that does the same task fairly well, but this board was right there and so I just didn’t see much of a need to do something like that is all."

Orientation & Mobility, Vision Rehab, any sort of adaptive tech services. That will introduce you to lots of strategies and resources.

p0030,Deaf- friendly yoga,22,deaf,"How structured are your classes?  If they are structured very well, you could have a powerpoint type presentation on a screen, showing the pose from different angles than the participants would see you AND some text describing it.

If it's heavily unstructured, then you have some issues to tackle.  You could make an index of all the different positions you are likely to do and have someone click through and show the above as you transition from one pose to another.

> Are there any good voice to text devices I could have available?

There are 2 kinds:

 * Ones with humans involved that tend to cost a lot, but do a great job
 * AI driven ones that are cheap/free and tend to do a better than nothing job.

The AI driven ones change all the time, and some do better than others, you need to try various ones to see which will do the best in your particular situation. They are not 100% accurate. Most of the time, given good voice input, they are reasonably accurate, but they tend to lose out on anything complicated or out of the ""normal"". They also almost never get nuance correctly.  For your application, that might not matter, but you need to try the different ones and see which seems to work best for your situation in your classes. To help it succeed, wear a microphone and use that as the input.

Also, if you haven't seen Apple Fitness+, they do some ASL at the beginning of the class, and have captions. It might give you some inspiration, and teach you some ASL you can use in your classes.
This is exactly why I've never been able to enjoy or get into yoga. I can't hear the instructor, can't wear my hearing aids, and can't follow along. It has just felt like an exercise in frustration every single time. Like - I've left every single class just feeling depressed and irritated. 

Maybe if I were already experienced or had more of a baseline of yoga knowledge it wouldn't be so tough, but for me, there are just other forms of exercise I enjoy more, so those are what I do. 

For me personally I think it would require very small class sizes (5 or 6 max) with more time for 1:1 attention and instruction. But I don't know if that's financially viable."
p0031,Waardenburg Syndrome,11,deaf,"""That happens with tinnitus""?! Does it? I've never heard of that!  
I'm assuming we're both in the UK so the ENT dr prescribed initially.  I must've got referred to the hospital with sudden 'idiopathic' hearing loss and literally the only treatment they have is steroids. (I have a dead left ear and mod/severe loss in the good ear so when that pops off its total silence).

As it's so hard to get an appt in an ENT emergency (I've gone through A&E at one point)  I got the ENT to write to the GP with the prescription so I can just obtain it when it happens and give myself the dose. They can also administer injections straight into the cochlear but I've never had that as I really don't fancy it. All ENT drs assume you can just stroll in and get your appt which is never the case. 

I think they should be treating your losses as sudden hearing loss, an emergency. For your reference my dosage is Prednisolone 5mg : 60mg for 7 days, 40mg for 3 days, 20mg for 3. They've no idea how it works,  it either brings down inflammation or it switches off the immune system in case your body is attacking itself.  Either way, it seems to work and I won't risk it without it. I take it the moment my hearing drops off.
 
With the vaccines the loss hit more or less 30 days after the jab each time so there was a question mark over it till I saw the pattern. The vaccines were designed to fire up the immune system so I think mine got overfired but m not alone, there are many reports on the net of this happening, even down to the 30 days later. Prior to vacvines  it seems to occur when I get a virus, but not always. Next time it happens they want me to go up to ENT as its happening to get an audiogram/ blood test etc but honestly I feel so awful when it does I'm reaching for the steroids straight away. 

Obviously they'd have to weigh up if OK for you to take them if you're on any other medications but I don't see why not. Rather tolerate horrible steroids for a few days than lose a bit more hearing permanently. 

Oof on the mould! I'm not a fan of audiologists in the main from previous experience. I have open fit but even I know with severe  hearing loss you need a closed mould. It sounds like you haven't been helped at all.  I didn't get a hearing aid till my 30s and according to my notes should've had one from 5 years old for my good ear - wasn't told. Its hard to aclimatise later on when you've just got on with it. 

Yes dominant gene. We're just discovering it now but it seems noone else in the family has exhibited any traits.   My dad has just been telling me how he used to have to do ankle exercises as a child to straighten out his legs...hmm!

I have an implant but I got really lucky I had a great knee specialist who was able to correctly figure out what I tore based on what happened. Only thing we didn't know was how bad the damage was and what needed to be done until he actually got in my knee on surgery day. Anyways. A torn knee can be hard on an athlete and it's unfortunate that your daughter had all those other things happening to her at the same time. She has gone through a lot in her short life and probably is processing everything.

Recovery time is a great time for you all to practice some sign language if you don't already know it. Make sure she sticks to her physical therapy.

p0037,How do those who are deaf feel about the word “disabled”?,5,deaf,"Lots of opinions. Lots of points and counterpoints. I'll give you a scattershot of a few;

pro deaf=disabled

 - It shows a form of internalised ablism and attempt to disassociate, making disabled people ""those folk over there"".
 - As per the medical model (even 'nicer' versions) disabled people lack an ability to do a thing that is statistically normal and normalised. 
 - As per the social model, society still clearly disables deaf people.
 - Most points against deaf=disabled can be critiqued with ""isn't that true for all disabilities?""

anti deaf=disabled

 - Disabled (as per the social model) is about whether your community or society disables. While broader society does disable Deaf people, the community around Deaf people does not. Once given access to community, language and communication - there is no disabling factor. There are also many global templates of what Deaf intetrated societies look like.
 - Its a trait variation that carries ability, sure, but so is ability/aptitude to do various sports or needing glasses and niether of those are considered disabilities. It can (and should be) completely normalised, or given its own cultural space, and therein be not a disability but just something that some people have like haircolour.

Personally - I think you either have to accept deaf as part of disability or use it to critique the ideology of disability completely (with the aim of bringing other disability groups along with us into whatever comes after). Doing just ""I'm deaf not disabled"" is a half-job.

p0038,Special educator- HOH/deaf Assistant,8,deaf,"Some ideas, and really, these help all TAs, not just the deaf/hoh ones…

-For any emergency information and procedures, especially for students with specific medical needs, type them up on one sheet, the largest font that will fit, laminate it onto red paper, and post it by the phone or the door. 

-it is helpful if you introduce her to people and fill them in on what they do and privately share who is good to work with and who is… not very supportive. 

-Ask if she has a preference for communicating information. I once had a TA who preferred to have a checklist of things to do each day. It was annoying and tedious to write it out, but it really did help the day go much smoother. 

-Find out what she likes and her skills. Is she a good artist? Ask her to make a bulletin board. Does she like to get outside for exercise and you need someone to walk a kid around to calm them down? Give her that task."
p0039,Any deaf-friendly way to learn Japanese?,2,deaf,"I’m just lurking because I made a new deaf friend, but this is a question I can really answer!

I think the issue is more that you haven’t found a study method that works for you rather than apps. I hardly use audio exercises myself, and since you can’t hear well, you’ll likely only need to focus on writing and grammar skills. I recommend Genki. It has audio exercises, but they’re optional. 

Most importantly, you need to find an exercise that you enjoy. Playing matching games, reading comics, writing posts online. I like those methods. I follow many Japanese people on Twitter and it keeps me sharp! What interests you? Find a way to get that content in Japanese."
p0040,I’m terrified of my own sister.,4,deaf,"This is your mom's responsibility to handle. Explain it as calmly as you can, don't call your sister names, have a solution ready. Maybe sister can play in a different room with a door closed. Maybe she can limit her gaming time to when you're at work/school/with friends. Maybe she can relieve that frustration some other way, like outdoor sports.

She is going to have to learn to regulate her volume and anger sometime, so other people don't get upset. She is going to have to learn that she can't just ignore other people's feelings and physical pain, if she wants to have any friends or a job in the future.  But it's not your job to teach her those things, it's your mom's. So:

1. Mom, I'm concerned about sister, she seems very angry and easily frustrated
2. Her frustration is causing me pain and I'm afraid it will affect my hearing
3. I've tried talking to her about this but she doesn't seem to understand
3. Can we have a family meeting to discuss how to resolve this?

Good luck. It's hard being a teenager and hard learning how to approach situations where the other person is not respecting your needs."
p0041,Help with cultural (?) divide/getting pushy deaf coworker to bugging me to learn sign language,5,deaf,"Well then.

To start off, who decides whether a person is ""normal"" or not? 

https://www.philosophytalk.org/shows/what-normal

This link goes to a more philosophical discussion (uncaptioned, but I read the listening notes). 

""Statistically, normal is the average or median of a set of data.  In a normative sense, norms are the standards by which our behavior is measured, such as morality and reason. ""


Here we can see how normal can be systematic and structural within a society, and how ""normal"" here differs from ""normal"" in Australia. Normal in America is not having healthcare, and normal in Australia is having universal healthcare, for example. 

Deafness as a whole is not the norm. Therefore, irregular or not normal! However, is that our fault? There are usually 2 paths of ""treating"" deafness, because of its inherent irregularity within society. Medical or cultural. This article divvies it up as ""pathological"" or ""cultural"".

https://www.verywellhealth.com/pathological-view-versus-cultural-view-of-deafness-1048594

This immediately makes me, a deaf person feel like I need to be ""fixed"" for a society that is not structured for people like me. I believe this is what one of the points that OP's co-worker was trying to drive home, but their approach was (seemingly) aggressive and harassing. 


Moving on to the term ""Hearing Impaired"". We all know what hearing is. I am more focused on ""Impaired"". Impaired is defined as... 

-""weakened, diminished, or damaged: to rebuild an impaired bridge.""

-""functioning poorly or inadequately: Consumption of alcohol results in an impaired driver.""

-""deficient or incompetent (usually preceded by an adverb or noun):
morally impaired; sports-impaired.)""

https://www.dictionary.com/browse/impaired?s=t

This gives us the idea that we all SHOULD be hearing. This is hugely detrimental because that assumes we all had hearing and lost it. That is not true. This gives an inherent assumption that not having full hearing is ""less than"". I understand that by default, there are limitations for us because of our hearing, because of the entire framework of society is based on hearing people!


Are we ""less than"" people that are automatically normal in society just because they can hear because it was built for them?


Ironically, I can't watch the philosophical video because its not captioned! Thats because majority of viewers are hearing and would not have a problem watching, and I am irregular. Is that my fault?


I think not.

p0043,I think most of us can agree we would be happier if we didn’t have  a chronic illnesses/disability (vent),51,disability,"It’s kinda like, well be grateful you don’t have to stress about bills or rent. That doesn’t make me feel any less depressed. In fact, I envy that’s what able bodied people have to worry about. Not that their health is declining or they are losing mobility year after year. 

I think I just need to sort out my thoughts and feelings on my own and not come to her. I hope eventually I can get to a point where my disability doesn’t bother me as much but it will take a long time.
My doctor had told the same thing. MD doesn’t cause pain. In a sense, it is true. It doesn’t cause pain directly but it does causes other muscles to compensate for the weak ones and that what causes the pain. Yet if we didn’t have MD we would not be in pain at all. So the way I see it is MD does cause pain no matter how you look at it. 

He won’t prescribe me anything either. He said to try and use mobility aids and see if that helps. I wish doctors could experience what it is like to have MD and see if they could do their job without pain killers. Would they even be able to keep up with their job with MD?Probably not!"
p0044,"I’m becoming bitter at a friend calling themselves disabled, and I don’t like it",155,disability,"I had to fall and hit my head twice before I started using the mobility aids my doctor wanted me to use. I don’t go out in public due to being embarrassed and afraid I’ll fall in public. I’m sorry you feel the way you do, and I’m terrified for you falling in public and hurting yourself any more than you already have. I really admire how you have become comfortable with the label and being disabled, I still really struggle with it but I’m working on it. I read you use your wheelchair, walker, and braces, maybe you could have someone help you get around when you have to go out? I dint mean to sound insensitive, i just know falling on top of everything else can not be good and sounds so scary.

There does seem to be some weird thing going on now people want to be or claim to be disabled. My friend said it must be nice to get pity and sympathy and have people try to accommodate me best they can. I was completely taken aback by that remark, and have put a lot of distance between us. Maybe have a serious conversation with your friend how insensitive and tone deaf they trying to one up your disability makes you feel. If they disregard your feelings, maybe it’s time to take a break from the friendship.
It's hard, because they probably don't realise what they're doing, and maybe they're responding to you in the way they would like to be responded to (if you catch my drift). I think some other people further up the thread had some good ways to break it to them that they're making you feel bad.

I think some people feel the same way as you do if I talk about being disabled (fibro/CFS, T1D, hypermobility syndrome, clinical depression/anxiety, migraines, autism, gastroparesis and IBS in my case) because they've got something more obviously disabling, like cerebral palsy, cancer of some kind, serious hearing loss, limb paralysis etc and I do get it, but I still need to describe my own problems to other people in a way they'll understand without drifting off. I guess we all just need to be mindful of others' issues somehow.
TL;DR Don't think you are a gatekeeper but rather suffer from your friends (unintended, I think) ""trivialisation"" of what you are going through. Good luck on maintaining that friendship and making the situation more comfortable for both of you.
___
I only have one mental disability (if depression doesn't count) and thought at first what you mentioned later: Oh, another gatekeeper. But the further I read, the less it seemed to me that you were gatekeeping at all. I don't like to compare illnesses in a contest like way, since depression seems like nothing compered to the struggles life have in store for others, yet still the mortality rates for depressions alone are scaring.

Yet what you describe, in my opinion, isn't about disability, but about making your struggles unseen by trivialising them. It is like … I am from Germany and we have here the nasty history about Nazi-Germany, the second world war and the Shoa, the mass-killings of jewish (and other) people. And therefore a law, that prohibits the trivialisation of national socialism, because it makes the victims and their sufferings unseen, if somebody, for example, compares unpleasant and unjust experiences with the mass-killings and torture in the so called ""Third Reich"".

I think that, on a different scale, you are fighting a similar conflict as you are not really gatekeeping (you never told your friend off or corrected them, when they mentioned an illness to others without saying, that they ""only"" self diagnosed themself, etc.), but that you struggle with your friends (unconscious, I think) attempt to trivialise the magnitude of your struggles, by comparing them with … far lesser (appearing?) common sufferings.

Like … someone here posted, a few days ago a screenshot of a post in an amputee subreddit of a women who has broken a finger and asked, in earnest, the amputees for advice how to deal with this, for her new, reality. It wasn't, in my opinion, gatekeeping either, when one user there told her to f*** herself with that broken finger she still had. Comparing ones own life with a **broken finge**  to that with the lives of people, who had lost their limbs … makes the struggles of the tatter unseen, as one might think ""*well, I've broken my finger once, and it did hurt, yes … but if that's all, an amputee have to suffer from, they really should get a grip and go on instead of …*"".

Really, I understand (no, not your MS, but) your annoyance with your friends (I think unintended) trivialisation of your sufferings. I think (but please be carful when following my advices, for I have for reasons no friends at all), that you …

- should explain to your friend, what harm their comparing do to you, so that they maybe keep it to themselves. That alone isn't gatekeeping, I'd say.
- accept if the continue labelling themself and for themself - even if they don't do the physio-exercises nor seek official diagnosis, etc. Because invisible disabilities ""can"" be more harmful, than they appear and one can never be really sure of the magnitude of another persons suffering - or so I think. If self-labelling helps them - why not? (As long as they don't harm others that way, by trivialising their struggles or taking away much needed resources, etc.)

Honestly, I don't see you as a gatekeeper at all. And think that your annoyances are quite understandable and reasonable. I hope you'll find a way to hold that friendship **and** find a way to stop letting your friends behaviour harm you as well.
My therapist (who was already solid, after a long time of me searching for one) became disabled after a few months of first seeing her. She had to take some months off and I don’t know the details of her condition (unnecessary), but she has disclosed that she has gained some of the same health struggles I have, some of which are more severe. It’s been pretty healing (seemingly for both of us) to be able to talk about the realities of this and the process of acclimating to these things. She was already very compassionate but the not needing to explain all of it is actually really nice, that a lot is just understood. Obviously I wish her health crisis hadn’t happened at all, I’ve had some years to adjust to my situation and can manage emotionally with most of it now (thanks in part to my husband also losing his health near the same time I did, though before we were together). I hate that she’s going through this shit too. But I can also definitely vouch for the ways having a disabled therapist can be healing. 

A very minor point, but when OP mentions the friend dances and still maintains a social life, well I can get the bitterness (I was functionally bedbound and extremely isolated for several years), but outside of trying to keep up that lifestyle potentially damaging the friend’s recovery/maintenance plans I will say that this might be a tiny bit reductive. My health issues are more severe it seems than their friend’s - I have constant and severe back pain that often means days in bed at a time, plus neurological issues from the same cause and having to catheterize as well as the regular infections that can come with that, which I’ve always been prone too. But even though my bad days outnumber the good ones and minor household chores can be enough to wreck me for days (I’m not nearly consistent enough to work), I have made some small improvements over the last couple years from my previous state of basically being wholly unable to take care of myself. And when I’m able, I try once a week to have one night to regularly socialize and often enough dance. Losing my physical functionality and my muscles atrophying into uselessness was pretty traumatic in itself, but the isolation was probably more life threatening. I was in extremely deep depression and even with my husband there for me felt very isolated, like I was no longer part of the world around me. 

Since I finally found decent doctors who will treat me (I was “too young for chronic pain,” regardless of the ten inch scar down my spine and obvious history of spina bifida) making sure I have some social outlets and sources of small joys had been a priority. I was losing my sense of self so badly, just being able to be around other people once a week has had such a huge impact and given me more strength and support to draw on during the bad days (which happen regularly whether or not I go out occasionally). I used to hate dancing due to self consciousness and how even before my crisis my body hurt and was misreading nerve signals. But honestly, I kind of love it now. I take it easy, mostly dance at goth nights (as you can kind of dance however you want to for that lol), and I do need to rest more the next day. But idk. It sparks joy to be able to use my body at all now. To be able to do anything remotely fun in it. I’m willing to take on some extra aches on top of my baseline pain for that, and honestly it’s helped motivate me to gently exercise with an easy outlet that can be as rigorous or gentle as I need it to be. It’s a luxury that not everyone gets, but I’m extremely glad I get to do it. Before I was able to rebuild any social life I mostly existed in this horrible state of suffer through, wait, try to believe that things can someday be better. That and my husband kept me from suicide at many points right after I’d lost everything with my health (my dream job, my sense of self, even most of my family since they treated me as “choosing to be weak”). But it’s not sustainable and finding small joys to live for, even if they expend some of my precious energy, has been incredibly helpful. 

I hope the friend learns to moderate between what they are used to and what they need to take care of themselves. But I honestly hope they can keep that zeal for life, keep having social outlets, keep dancing. It’s understandable for OP to feel bitter about it, the way the friend is trying to “relate” by constantly recenter themselves is irritating as hell, and there should probably be either a conversation or some distance. I felt pretty damn bitter when I was watching the world pass me by in the immediate aftermath of my health crisis, back when I still didn’t have coping tools and everything was so new and overwhelming. It’s fair to not want to be reminded of the things OP can’t do especially while this is fresh. But I also think we should try not to be crabs in a bucket to each other or police how people manage their health too much. Even with relatively minor health issues (at least compared to what many of us deal with) it’s understandable for people to cope differently and want to hold onto things that bring joy when possible. 

I also don’t like the idea of particularly able bodied people being like “well you can dance, you must not *acshually* be disabled” when for a lot of us the degree of our limitations is highly variable on the day and it’s the overall inconsistency of health that makes things the most challenging. Like for me most people will not see me on the bad days because I literally can’t leave the house. Of course I’m going to look more well to them than is representative of my reality. And the few times I’ve needed to be around people (other than my husband) on the bad days (which again, more days are bad than good even now) the shock at what that looks like is visible - on some level they just assumed I was exaggerating 🤷🏻 I’m not going to give up the few little things I have that keep me going to appear “disabled enough” for people who will always look for a reason to ignore the needs of disabled people.
EDS is Eherlos Daniel Syndrome - it's hyper mobility in your joints
It's like the example of someone in a wheelchair.   They are mostly perceiving that they get to sit down wherever they go.   Not how much difficult that really makes life.   That these disabilities prevent us from being truly independent in our lives.   

These kinds of people take for granted their own abilities.  They can't see how much quality of life  Diminishes, more dependent someone is.   

It's concepts that they can't wrap their head around because they've experienced nothing that prevents them from being independent.   

For example,  The simple act of just getting dressed in the morning.   They can get themselves dressed and they can decide to go somewhere's for the day.   They don't have to take into account how their currently feeling,  The time and effort it takes to get dressed.  Even the thinking process that goes along with how to accomplish these tasks.  The energy levels after completing these tasks which takes so much more energy than the average person.  

You have to think about how you're going to be safe if you want to even go to groceries.   Maybe transportation issues because you can't walk,  Or always being in a state of Anxiety because you don't have full control over the actions of your own body.  

I personally always have anxiety because I'm more vulnerable than the average person.  If I get triggered I risk my body collapsing and  completely vulnerable to any stranger coming up to me.   

To an everyday average person living that regular lives,  Could be life-threatening to me or other people with disabilities.   I don't think they understand because they've never had to live With everyday choices being a risk to their life.   

And people Struggling with real disabilities,  Don't want their disabilities.   I'm speaking in general I'm sure  There are always exceptions.  

I firmly believe most people would rather try to live and average everyday life where they're independent and they can choose to live their life the way they want and do what they want.  They have to revolve their lives around their disability.   Not  Because they choose to ,  But because there is no other way around it.  

I find a general good way to tell a difference between someone who is really struggling and trying to live life with disability, And someone who's following the trend,  Is there behavior and how the act towards it.   Most people and I'm saying most because like I said before there are exceptions,   Don't like to bring attention to their disabilities.  Unless it's for education sake.   

They don't want to be seen for their disability.  They want to be seen for who they are as a person.   And these people make what they consider a disability their whole personality in life.   They go out of their way to bring attention to themselves.  But they show no signs of trying to do anything to help themselves.  

There's a kind of arrogance in their demeanour.   And whether they are truly disabled or not it just shows that a personality is c***** and that their self-centered.
It’s sad that all of us had the same experience with medical.  I just happen to be very stubborn, so after hearing that I just had to “maybe try a cane” because I was only 40, I bought a used mobility scooter.  It changed my life so radically that I knew it couldn’t be wrong to use!  
Our doctors tell us that we should have a bunch of options to deal with our issues, a “toolbox” of things, from medication, various talk or physical therapies, exercise, diet, etc, an appropriate mobility aid is not to be feared!  My roommate and I (we both use wheelchairs, I’m able to walk in the house, she can do a couple of steps) are prime examples.  When we each got our wheelchairs, we both LOST weight, because we were able to cook and shop far more easily!  Yet we chose to purchase our own mobility devices (and yes, we are both lucky we have that ability), because we only qualify for a walker to shuffle a few feet…. Our chairs keep us lively and independent, but for some reason, that’s not a good thing, lol?"

p0046,Handicapped parking,20,disability,"A placard let’s you park in a handicapped spot, period. If your doctor signed off, you are deemed disabled. Don’t overthink this. It’s commendable to think of others but using your logic, you should never use your placard because someone with more severe mobility issues would always “need” it more. Just park where you need to, to keep you & your child safe.
As someone with a placard for my mostly invisible disability, (which I always need mobility aids for, sometimes a wheelchair,) ignore the haters and do what you feel is best. If you need the space, use the space. No need to feel guilty about it, or rationalize to yourself how to use it. Do what you need to do to keep your kid safe! Where I am, there are also spaces for moms with kids. If you have similar, you could always use those if you can't make yourself use the disabled spaces. They're also right up front. 

I do know what it's like. The first time I was approached and judged for using a disabled space, I went home and cried the rest of the night. I've grown a very thick skin since. They don't know you or what you're going through. It sounds like you'd qualify just for your ankle issue alone, let alone dealing with your son. So go ahead and use the space. As long as the person has a placard, that's all I care about. It's all the people parking there without one that I take issue with."

Also thanks for just being honest and saying it won't get better. It won't. I know that. You know that. Platitudes don't make it better, but someone being real with you...that makes it better. :)
Powerchair basically made the difference between being trapped in the flat, completely dependent on others (usually strangers) and a reasonable amount of self sufficiency.

Where I live, within 15 minutes walking distance, there’s about 5 drugstores, 2 huge groceries and another small one, 5 discounters, multiple Cafés and bakeries not counting those in the grocery stores, 3 butchers, a very high quality perfume and makeup and such store, multiple pharmacies, 4 hairdressers and 3 parks. And iirc 3 or 4 are not accessible to me. Every other store I can go in, look around, get assistance as needed for articles on high or low shelves, check out, pay, pack my purchases all by myself if I want to.

Yes, it complicates transit somewhat. I use public transit as much as possible, and a disabled transport taxi service. When DH and I want to go somewhere in a car, we’re stuck with an uncomfortable old folding manual chair, but we’ve managed to make do.

If at all possible, look into the ottobock selection of powerchairs. You can choose standard rear wheel drive, or get front wheel drive (or even middle!) and they look good while being built like tanks. Almost indestructible.

Direct honesty is the least you deserve. I just hope you’re spared the path my progression chose to take. I turn 40 soon, but my heart is so damaged that I repeatedly get warnings from medical professionals that I’m on borrowed time. Ugh! Stupid fucking bodies! *hugs*

That happened to me once. I have a brain injury plus a brain stem injury so I have various mobility and cognitive impairments.  
  
So like in your post, when I suddenly was ""able-bodied"" in every way, it absolutely freaked me out and I was scared but then started to get happy when my hands and arms worked and I could walk well without losing my balance and needing supports. As an aside, I have always considered myself lucky because with my regular testing and hospital visits, I see people far worse than me.

Anyway, my initial shock or worry was replaced with joy and I became more and more ecstatic until I fell over into a pool or river of smelly gel or poop and then woke up.

FWIW I’ve always had mildly lower core muscle tone and I was in OT for something sort of related. We tried starting to work on it but I didn’t tolerate it well and my OT said it would be very long term/slow. It’s not so bad that I felt up to that at the time haha (it’s more that I can’t do stuff like rock climbing or treading water, doesn’t affect my posture like yours does), but I have been slowly trying some yoga that focuses on that. But yeah maybe getting into PT/OT could help even if it is slow going like mine said. 
A few things about your post really stand out to me. If you have POTS, it's extremely common to also have some form of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). That usually presents with hypermobility, joint and/or tendon pain, frequent joint dislocations or subluxations, things like that. Only a few types of EDS have been genetically sequenced so getting gene testing isn't necessarily guaranteed to produce an answer for you on that disorder.

And when it comes to you going to the gym and PT but never having it feel ""easier"", have you always experienced this at all ages when it comes to any type of exercise, where it feels like you should be building muscle but you haven't? Have you ever been evaluated by a neurologist? Do you have an abnormal walking gait/do you waddle when you walk? Do you have abnormally large calf muscles? Do you experience scapular winging (where your shoulder blades stick out from your back when you hold your arms straight out in front of you), have had problems in your childhood/teens with getting down to/up from a sitting position on the ground (and especially if you've never been able to get up/down like your peers via essentially doing a squat)? Have you ever gotten blood results back that came with very high liver enzymes or a high bilirubin? There are a few types of Muscular Dystrophy that can basically show no/very mild symptoms until around 20's-40's, especially ones like Limb-Girdle, Becker, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (all forms of Muscular Dystrophy). There are a LOT of subtypes for these specific types of MD, and even people with the same subtype can vary wildly in their symptom onset, disease progression, and severity of symptoms, but these diseases are very rare, so definitely don't freak out if any of this sounds familiar, just be sure to bring it up to your doctor as soon as you can.

I usually don't like to do the whole ""armchair diagnosis"" thing, but I have Limb-Girdle MD type 2i and your post sounds almost exactly like something I would have wrote like 15 years ago lol. Let me know if you have any questions and I hope you find the answers you're looking for ❤
i figure the hypotonia is catching up with me, the neurosurgeon and his PA i spoke to about potential chiari (i have slightly low cerebellar tonsils but apparently whether something counts as CM-1 depends on the diagnostician) & spine problems didn't seem to be a concerned much at all about hypotonia that doesn't seem to have gone away since childhood, PCP is willing to refer me to a neurologist once i get other more pressing stuff out of the way first which i agree with since i'm a full-time student & this stuff isn't as concerning as the gynecological disorder doing things like causing me very severe leg pain, worse than anything the low muscle tons has ever led to

and aaahhh!!!!! i love swimming, that was my fav sport they made me try but i couldn't keep up with my peers & had to drop out for other reasons as well, my school used to have a pool but they shut it down due to lack of finances for upkeep 😔
my OT had to google what hypotonia was (which is funny because it's not really a common thing?) & my last attempt at PT had me leaving in tears because i felt like i wasn't really being understood/taken seriously & that feeling activated the trauma from my child abuse/medical neglect, so yeah that didn't go well

i'm willing to try PT again at some point (hopefully before i lose my medicaid) but i really want a better picture of what's going on at first so i can stop telling people these vague things & ""maybe's"" and maybe also find a PT familiar with what my issues are instead of just any old PT, i might see about it over the summer depending on what happens between now & then since it wouldn't work well with my class schedule right now

i have hard time with coordinating different muscle groups at the same time to properly do some exercises though (potential chiari has been dismissed so maybe undx'd dyspraxia), they had to cue me on stuff up until i was discharged so there was minimal improvement in that area & that's something that gets in the way of doing stuff on my own which is kinda what's necessary for PT, very annoying

i wish my parents got me PT as a kid 😔
i have generalized symptomatic hypermobility but any joint instability has stopped being an issue since i started taking continuous birth control so while i think hEDS (if not gHSD, i was denied for genetic testing but the only genetic form i fit the symptom profile of is pretty rare - clEDS - so unlikely) is a possibility getting that exact dx isn't a priority for me atm, and no, to my knowledge i've never seen a neurologist, though i plan to

i was dedicated to the gym last summer, and i may have been seeing improvement in the context of the gym (i wasn't really keeping track but all i can say now is that after a long break i'm having a much harder time getting started again than i did the first time i started), but specifically what i meant about the ""getting better"" part is less gym performance and more not seeing improvement in being able to do my part-time job or ""ordinary"" life things requiring physical effort (including having good posture and being able to sit at my desk), so i can't really say for sure if i haven't been able to build muscle

as for other stuff:

- i think i waddle but only contextually, like depending on how i'm feeling, most days i don't think i do, according to my first PT session i have some mild gait abnormalities like bilateral trendelenberg, neurosurgeon i recently saw said i had a normal gait & no signs of muscle atrophy
- no clue about the scapular winging (edit: took a look, doesn't seem like it, not when i hold my arms out)
- afaik my calf muscles are normal, i don't know what would qualify as too big but they seem normal to me
- as for getting up, i've always had some level of difficulty/preference for using my hands or the support of something else to give up, i forgot the name for the specific ""sign"" that is getting up in a certain way that indicates some type of weakness, is that what you're referring to? squats in the gym are REALLY hard on me, i know that, & if i deep squat i risk my muscles not letting me go up immediately, i don't think that's what you mean though
- no idea about bilirubin & the only time i think i've had high liver enzymes is when i was in the hospital for an overdose on tylenol, so probably not relevant lmao

hopefully a neurologist will be amenable to looking into the muscle stuff & my nerves being shitty (lifelong paresthesias) but we'll see - i appreciate your input! also yeah, i recently learned CMT-2 was even a thing, let alone there being like 80 of them lmao
I also have congenital hypotonia for me my issues were caused by a connective tissue disorder (Hypermobility spectrum disorder).
i had a pretty bad bout of influenza once but that was so long ago i couldn't say whether or not that was the trigger, i also have generalized joint issues + generalized hypermobility but any pain/other problems related to that have virtually disappeared since taking continuous birth control so seeking evaluation for possible hypermobile EDS (i was denied genetic testing due to lacking certain clinical criteria so monogenic EDS is unlikely i guess) or generalized HSD isn't as high a priority on my list as all the stuff i have that sometimes occurs alongside it (on top of the fact there's no medical professionals around me who know enough about that stuff), for the POTS getting testing for potential SFSN/other nerve problems is something i'd seek out before anything to do with hEDS or gHSD"
p0054,What was the breaking point that made you get a cane/other mobility aid?,5,disability,"I'd get a Mobility Scooter if I could, but even second hand they're over £700 (WTF?!)"
p0055,AITAH for not wanting to meet in the park for the first date as a physically disabled woman?,112,disability,"Why did he want to go to a park? 

Personally I'm immunocompromised in addition to my mobility impairment so I will only do the first 3-5 dates outdoors for safety reasons. 

There's no reason for him to be rude or pushy regardless but I'm wondering if it was a case of opposing access needs.
Honestly, as someone whose not in a wheelchair 24/7 and occasionally uses a cane for mobility assistance..

Hell I wouldn't meet someone in a park when I was (more) able bodied for a first date unless I already knew them really really well. 

First date out of the blue which is also first time meeting someone in person? I ain't meeting that person in a park. I ain't going on a hike as a first date. 

And hell, if they're doing that much pushback on something as simple and unthreatening as where our first (0date) date is gonna be at, my hackles are raised. I'd begin thinking dating this person was actually a bad idea and seriously consider unmatching and blocking the person. 

So many red flags.
That makes a lot of sense and is more context than just being in a park, thanks for the clarification!

  
I live in a city and often suggest parks as a first date option because it lowers cost, either of us can bail immediately (no waiting for a check from waitstaff) and unless we are going deep into the trails on the bigger parks, they are popular spots often filled with families with children, crafting and language groups, and exercise groups doing stuff like CrossFit and tai chi, so they generally feel safe.

  
Good luck on the dating front!
I never know what to say, though when we “go for a walk” my roommate says we “tootle”. We need more mobility words!"
p0056,Saying ‘No I can’t take care of you’ and disability justice. How much is too much/not enough? ,25,disability,"Even when people are getting paid (I have a mobility disability and home health aides), still it is the responsibility of the disabled person to have depth of care and be responsive to the stated and unspoken needs of their caregivers. That way, everyone avoids burnout and resentment.  

Home health aides are often grossly under compensated and many folks work way long weeks, providing crucial services, and because some degree of emotional bond almost always forms, it’s frequently difficult for caregivers to let themselves be  unavailable.
That makes a lot of sense. I can’t imagine it would be easy to have a caretaker say ‘no’ last minute to something like transportation. Thank you for sharing!
I’ve heard stories from a lot of people that the  assumption that disabled people who use mobility aids need help when none has been asked and it sounds deeply, deeply frustrating and awful. In your experience, does this also extend to people asking if you need help? What are things you wished ambulatory people knew?  "
p0057,How to develop self-love after disability ,8,disability,">I come from a dysfunctional family to boot. I've escaped my cult after decades of abuse and cut my family and friends all off and had to start over with no one.

The op can't easily do this. She has zero income and mobility issues. So is stuck in her room and will probably be with her family and zero real-life friends unless something changes. She is also in Asia if that helps anyone.

>I use a friendship app to swipe for friends

You should post a link to the app that you use so the op can also use it. 😊

>I am in hobby groups because I have tons of hobbies to keep me company so I'm not depending solely on other humans to keep me entertained.

I assume that you are either looking for ideas or help with your hobbies in these groups. That or you are helping others. Having something to keep your mind busy.

They’re fun to lay down next to and use the cat wands around allowing the cats to “hunt” from inside or behind the tubes. It makes playtime more engaging since I can’t run around with them.

Other than that of course a laser for when they want to run fast but I have to stay in bed. 

Cat trees are great for them to get their climbing in. 

I also sometimes walk them around the block in a stroller so I can use the stroller for support when I walk for exercise. 

Have fun!"
p0059,Disabled Mom struggling to take care of baby- Advice needed,42,disability,"My mum has gotten progressively more disabled as my life has gone on. One of my first memories is getting her cane for her so she could get out of bed. I still love her and wouldn’t trade her for anything, and while I sometimes wish that we could’ve done more physical activities together, I never really thought about it until other people pointed it out. I have grieved with her as her health gets worse, but I’m also very grateful that as I’ve developed my own health issues in the last few years that I’ve had someone in my corner who really gets it. No one understands me like my mum *because* she is a disabled parent. She’s also instilled so much compassion in me, and even before I got sick I was much more aware of accessibility needs and ableism than others my age. I’m so blessed to be able to say that her disability has made me a better person. Your child will likely grieve some of the differences in their childhood when they get older, but that will not be the defining characteristic of their life or their relationship with you. Raise them to be kind, compassionate, and resilient. Raise them to know it’s ok to rest even if the masses insist on the hustle and grind culture. Raise them to adapt and have fun with your disability (nothing like decorating a mobility aid to make it flashy haha). 

Sorry I don’t have more practical advice, but I hope this helps. My mum and I have had issues of course, but they aren’t because she’s disabled.
Thank you! I know I try my best to show that to both my baby and my stepson. I have a really close relationship with my stepson despite him being a sports kid and me not being able to very limited sports things with him: I needed that reminder"
p0060,Is it.. bad I have a hard time admitting I am disabled?,29,disability,"There's no disability fairy that comes and waves a magic wand and all of a sudden someone is branded ""officially disabled"". For some, yes, there is a defining singular moment. Maybe they became disabled after a traumatic injury, or were disabled at birth. But for a lot of us, we have a gradual decline in health and then have to figure out where we stand and how we feel about it. And it can be a hard thing to wrap our heads around because it's something we have to decide for ourselves.  

Disability is not a dirty word. But society conditions us to believe it is. So yes, it's very normal to have trouble attaching that label to yourself. Everyone becomes disabled eventually, whether it's at age 15 or 85. I didn't feel comfortable calling myself disabled for a year or two after being diagnosed and needing to use mobility aids full-time, even though I'm sure others would have thought of myself as disabled long before then. You're at the beginning of your own journey, and there's a long path ahead. Ultimately it's up to you when on that path you feel comfortable giving yourself a label.
I personally don't think it's bad. I do understand that it can be hard admitting that tho. Have struggled with that a lot myself. I've been dealing with multiple mental health issues since childhood, and after quite a few failed attempts at working, I wound up on disability as an adult. I wasn't happy with it, but I eventually accepted it. Since I have what's considered to be an invisible disability, it hasn't been easy navigating society. After a mild bout of COVID three years ago, we discovered that I have a chronic illness on top of all the mental health issues, and I've had it since my teens. Tbh, this diagnosis came as no surprise. Still, it's been a struggle to accept this. And the chronic illness has been worsening the last several years. It's invisible for the most part now (meaning I don't use any mobility aids), but I may wind up bedbound one day. I've already been getting more housebound as this has worsened. My ability to do day to day stuff has been deteriorating, and it's been so frustrating and scary. I don't want to have this chronic illness or all of these mental health issues. I want to be healthy and able-bodied too. :'(
No! This is absolutely normal and something we all go through and have to come to terms with. It's a real mind f*ck at first, but I promise you it will get easier day by day as it becomes your new norm. Do not feel insecure if people stare at you either! In a lot of people's minds, they invision disability with elderly and seem (are) surprised to see anyone under the age of 65 with a mobility aid... Ignore them or simply make eye contact, and they will look immediately look away, lol"
p0061,dealing with disabilities?,0,disability,"Your sports, working out etc doesn't need to be taken away from you. I'm in a wheelchair & keep plenty fit for a 45yr old. I do marathon distances for fun, go out for 10 mile 'rolls' a few times a week. I do okay. We know how good exercise is for mental health. 

A disability doesn't necessarily mean 'the end'. 

I totally understand how you're feeling, my disability started with pain when walking before I ended up losing a leg & ending up in a chair, I felt like my life had been torn from me & honestly I spent a few years in a dark place (not all due to my failing legs), but honestly my life right now is the best it's been. Ever.

Note: I am in no way saying that because you have pain in your leg, that you'll end up in a wheelchair. So please don't read what I've said & panic.
Hi I'm 17 but I was diagnosed with my disability at 14, i use a cane and custom leg braces to walk better and sometimes use a wheelchair. I dance and used to do musical in school and a bunch of other activities. I still dance but I no longer do a lot of my other activities. I at first also felt like everything was taken away from me too. But you can still try to do the things you love it just is a lot harder and you may not be able to do things even when you really want to or try hard to. I'm a dancer I still dance like I said but I often fall or am too painful to dance nor can I dance as good as I used to but I do what I can and take breaks when I must. Some advice I have is do not over work yourself and talk to someone about your disability such as your sport's coach if you feel comfortable enough to do so, they can hopefully understand your situation and they might even have some advice you can try. For instance I did musical 2 years ago and am currently talking to the teacher that runs it to see if I'm able to preform or work something out to work back stage this year. It is unfair to not be able to do the things you like doing and I wish I could say everything was the same when my disability worsened about 2 years ago but it would be a lie. Not everything is easy and I ofc don't know you or your disability but you can still try or try with accommodations because I've learned that even though my disability plays a huge role in my daily life I can still try and not give up on what I love doing. If you don't at least try you will never know what you're capable of even with a disability, there are so many things I gave up when things got hard and I won't lie and say I don't think about giving up dancing almost every day but I love doing it and loving my activities for me wins over how much I have to put in to keep going. I'm very sorry to hear you are dealing with this, it's definitely hard to say what will happen, everyone is different and I hope the best for you
thank you so so much for this, i barely see anybody my age also working with disabilitys, and reading this gave me alot of relief! im glad to hear that you can still do the things you enjoy, even with difficulty. i will definitely speak to my coach and such on things to do so i can still play my sport for the season"

In both cases, it makes me feel like there's a negative connotation, like I'm being looked down upon for my needs. It makes me worry for when I will eventually need to start using a wheelchair.
Yes I hate it when others use it. I use it in reclamation and as a part of disability pride but every time someone says “cripple the economy” or “oh they’re crippled” or “crippling anxiety” I actually get so pissed and annoyed and sad and angry about how little people understand the history of the word and the violence associated with it.

p0065,How to Cope,12,disability,"I used to run track in middle school and high school. Fairly fast but not the best. 51 second 400m, could never break the 50 second barrier sadly. After high school I went into the military because my parents were already paying for my brothers’ college. I didn’t want to be another financial burden and the military was a solution. Few years of service later, I developed knee problems. My fastest two mile in high school was 10:59, not stellar but above average for the most part. After those years of service, knees just worn out, cannot even do 20 minute two miles. And that’s just depends on if I even last the two miles.

And then this past year, I got into a motorcycle accident. Leg was twisted and I was confined to a wheelchair during my initial healing process. Nothing broken, but my tendon was really bad. My knee for that leg is now maltracking and I am stuck with my cane. If I walk without a cane, my leg makes very **very audible popping and cracking noises.** And don’t get me started on the distance I can walk.

I can run, but after a minute of running I basically have to sit. And my running is a shadow of what it used to be. Compared to where I used to be, it has been a slow descent through depression. 

My advice is to get therapy to help navigate your feelings. My coping mechanisms is the gym. I can still go to the gym and machine workouts and do pull ups and dips and other things that don’t involve heavy lifting with my legs. But I suppose what I’m trying to say is you shouldn’t narrow your headspace just because it feels like the world is closing in.

Many PTs don't know how to work with hypermobility. Your experience is not uncommon but it shouldn't be standard. Hypermobility is a complex issues because building strength is super important but you need to limit stretching because the movements that feel natural aren't usually within a healthy range. My old PT was constantly telling me to make smaller movements. 

If you can find a PT in your area that is experienced with hypermobility, you are likely to have a better experience, but they are hard to find, I still haven't found one.
I have had similar experiences with physiotherapy, but also some good ones. Physiotherapy with a focus on pain management worked better for me than a focus on mobility. That's because it was almost impossible to do difficult but helpful exercises until I learnt to manage my pain more (although pain and mobility are connected). I also had the experience of being basically told ""stop doing that and move like a normal person"" like it had just never occurred to me to try?! But now its extremely obvious I can't do that. 

I don't understand their comment about range of movement. If you're hyperextending your knees, it sounds like your range of movement is *too much -* it can go the other way. 

General physiotherapists seem uniquely terrible at dealing with hypermobility, although its slowly changing. Don't give up!
Youre not exagerrating, hypermobility sucks. You need to find a PT who specifically knows a lot about hypermobility. Most don't have a clue about it. 


However even with a hypermobility informed PT, you likely will be expected to self-advocate, and the main focus will be exercises. Unfortunately we have to teach ourselves a lot and fight for ourselves


Try your best to figure out what your personal goals are (ex. more support with mobility day-to-day to increase function, self-care, etc, and preserve energy so you can actually do the exercises), and practice asking for help with them, and write questions up ahead of time. Also write down your limitations (ex. can't stand with your knees bent). The more prepared you are the better it goes. It sucks because it's a lot of effort and I wish theyd take more initiative, but they don't, so we have to :(


Good luck!

All patients have “ the right to fall and sue”. We have a right to cover our butts legally, everyone is clumsy and has blame in their fall.
that makes sense! in my case this was from a neurosurgeon consult & a referral for a full-body bone scan, but that might become relevant when i have a surgery at the end of this month that might affect my mobility during recovery

p0070,[Rant] Endless cycle of getting worse because condition makes it harder to seek care,18,disability,"Exercise with a disability can be so mundane and frustrating. I have a gym membership but I do the lightest weights on every machine and even that’s hard. Are you able to save up to buy resistance bands? They are a much cheaper alternative than weights and honestly more suitable for people with disabilities imo. I also struggle with motivating to workout myself. It can be so demoralizing doing barley any exercise and just being exhausted and knowing you won’t get much stronger. But I try to tell myself it’s better to move your body a little rather than not all. It will further progress our weaknesses being stagnant. I hope you find some good workouts that work for you!
If you'd like to be more active without a gym membership I highly recommend Hybrid Calisthenics. He has a website and a youtube channel. On the site there are very easy variations of every exercise that are comparable to physical therapy. If you can't do a pushup for example there is a guideline for working up to a single pushup with wall pushups, then inclined pushups, etc. No equipment strictly necessary and there are suggestions for low cost set ups if you do want some equipment.

In the end though remember that it's okay to not be where you were before and to not push yourself past your limits to perform to abeled standards. Moving your body is good! But if you can never get to a full pushup or pull up ( I couldn't), doing the easier variations is still worth it to keep your joints healthy. Anything at all is better than nothing. If you're to the point where walking up the stairs or even sitting up from a chair is exercise, that is okay. 

Also second what the other commenter said about resistance bands! I was using the smaller ones and with some youtube walkthroughs you can get a really great workout in a tiny bedroom. Good luck!"

Jeez, doc, stop obsessing about my need for a wheelchair atrophy prevention PT routine and focus on how demoralizing it is spending 3 hours on the phone with Medicaid Transportation each week trying to book wheelchair van rides to my appointments! Can I just get the damn script for the as needed benzos already??!?😡

😂 

A #spoonie has a bracelet or a small wallet card to notify 911 of a disability. 
A #complexspoonie has a life alert button and 2 sided 8.5 x 11"" paper full of text explaining all 15 conditions/diseases they somehow live with.
I'm on disability for a rare incurable disease that has destroyed the mobility of my arms, hands, legs, and feet.

And I am neither depressed nor have anxiety.

I am the complete opposite, working hard every single day to have the best quality of life I can.

Perspective. It can change everything about life in a second.

Stay strong 💪
I hate you Had To go Through with that. Just tired of ignorant Ableist people sometimes 

Yeah Your Reasons For being on Disability is Valid 

Just Made me Also think about my personal experience with people like that 

Like it makes me Very Sad that Some people don't understand 

How Much Non Visible as well as Visible Disabilities effects people 

Well for me I have Severe Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder 

And bipolar disorder and unspecified PTSD, And recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability 

Just get tired Of The Abled body making disability like the Olympics 

Like people have to compete with each other to see if they Disabilities are severe enough for disability 

Which true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function 

Which this does 

Which I have Agoraphobia I'm the opposite I can't Be Around people 

I can't even go to the Hospital without having a panic attack 

like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent 

Because I still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function 

Only time I leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult 

But I live alone don't really have support 

Since I look so Normal and functional unfortunately 

Plus people think because I'm a black man I'm immune to being disabled or having a disability 

Just kinda hard Because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community 

It effects me daily 

It's detrimental on my economic status 

It's hard to just text and talk on the phone 

Even right now I'm getting a headache 

But it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability 

Try to explain to ignorant people that are Ableist like you dealt with 

I'm quite the opposite I can't stay with people I would have a panic attack unfortunately 

It's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis 

Like they force you to share rooms which aggravates my disabilities.

And aggravates my anxiety PTSD symptoms as well 

Just everyones disability effects people differently 

Mines kinda severe to me 

Like Hate the Competition Thing abled body people created 

Sound like people have to compete with each other like freaking capitalism 

Just for Disability payments 

I hate that 

I wouldn't apply for disability if I didn't need it 

I felt so much guilt younger

People saying my disability is not severe because they can't see it 

Or people always assume you faking it 

Since mental illness they quote you can fake 

Which makes me very upset 

Because they will never know how I feel in my body and mind 

If only that knew they wouldn't be saying that 

And by the way Disability payments can't even cover Rent payments 

A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is over 1500$ for the worst area 

So probably pushing 2000$+ for a good area

Just make me upset and triggered 

Because I have no reason to make up how my disability effects my life daily 

People are so ignorant with mental illness 

They assume because I'm laughing at a movie 

Or taking a selfie 

I'm faking a mental illness 

Which makes me upset 

Like My therapist tells me to watch television using coping mechanisms to distract 

Like they don't know people with disabilities don't always have bad days 

Have a bunch of bad days 

Which I do but 

I like doing the coping mechanisms my therapist taught me 

Just make me cry a little 

Because Disabilities people can't understand what they can't see

Not trying to get emotional 

Just your post resonated with my life 

Bought up bad memories I guess 

Like people think because I workout 

Which is at home by the way 

I can't handle public commercial gyms by the way 

But people assume because I'm trying to use a coping mechanism 

To cope with my disability 

That means I'm faking it 

Or using reddit as a journal like now 

Which I'm anxious as well typing this 

Just people don't understand disabilities effect people differently 

Just Ableism in society 

Might not be to abled body person that has no problems leaving their house 

Or a person that doesn't feel like a lion is being chased after him for just talking or talking on a phone 

Like I live alone but my with my disability I couldn't live with people that would make my condition worse 

I had anxiety just living with family members 

Just because I live alone people think my mental health is not severe 

That really makes me upset 

Because Disabilities effects people differently 

Mines just as severe or life altering as anyone else 

Just because I live alone doesn't mean I'm independent 

I still can't keep a job and stuff 

I don't think being independent is until I can live a functioning life 

And people that have jobs still have disabilities 

Disability effects everyone differently 

I hate this grade scale stuff 

That Ableist people use to say you not deserving of help

Just Ableism sigh

Which I tell distant family and Ableist strangers on social media sites 

I don't have to live in a group home unfortunately 

Because my anxiety would get worse and turn to a crisis 

Just I really relate to your post op 

I guess I got triggered by you quoting Ableist people that said that to you 


But hate people feel like mental illness is not taking seriously 

Which I'm not physically disabled which I definitely respect and understand 

But speaking from a Ableist person perspective 

Like they think people with mental illness or other invisible disabilities 

Should not be considered for disability 

And they always say we lazy or faking because we lazy 

Which I would love to keep a stable job 

But capitalism doesn't value that capitalism values efficiency and profit 

And doesn't value disabled people fitting in 

Not trying to rant on capitalism because I know everyone opinions is different 

I would love to work it's just hard with my conditions

Because due to Ableism they really think People getting disability checks 

That doesn't even cover a full month of rent 

Is a luxury.

Which the Lowest paying minimum wage job pays more than disability pays people.

Like This effected me for a long time 

My whole life 

Just because it gets me emotional knowing because you don't see me walking in a cane or wheelchair 

Or a Down Syndrome or something more visible 

Like I don't have those conditions I'm still disabled as them 

Autism you can't see, learning disabilities you can't see

Even some physical illnesses are invisible 

Such as Sickle Cell and Lupus 

Everything is not visible like blindness 

But my mental illness effects my life as much as any other disability effects people lives in society 

Just because I have muscle or tall black and 6'2""

Keep myself groomed 

I guess I have to look unhoused to For people to understand how my disability effects me seriously 

It's so flawed 

Invisible Disabilities doesn't work like that unfortunately 

I'm deserving of disability as much as anyone that has a disability 

Sorry for the rant OP
Don't believe those negative claims. While your physical issues may still be unclear, both anxiety and depression are treatable. I come from a family with a genetic predisposition to depression, and four years ago, I struggled with severe anxiety and depression. However, after eight months of effort, I fully recovered—without using medication or psychotherapy.



If you take the time to learn more about healing anxiety and depression through nutrition and exercise, and stick to the process, you too can achieve a full recovery.
That is a beautiful dress!

I'm on disability for horrible ptsd, bipolar 1 and anxiety, unable to handle life as a ""real person"" and now I have physical conditions that are impossible to do anything much as my mobility is super impacted.
I use multi-disabled. I have vision, hearing, mobility, dexterity and psychiatric disabilities. But I think 2 is still ""multi"". :)"
p0073,‘Disabled’,45,disability,"Ayyy I'm also 19 with several disabilities.

My mom is a Gen-xer and she had to come to terms with me being disabled at the same time she realized her herself had been disabled all her life too with three conditions I also have and she never really realized it (like many folks with Autism, Ehlers-Danlos and Narcolepsy, we both kinda thought it was normal until I started having severe sleep issues and pain). 

In a way, I think I struggle more with my own limitations that my mom struggles with them. I try so so hard to do things I know I can't. And she is always the first to remind me that NO ONE can do everything, my limitations are just harder set and more visible than others'. But instead of busting my balls to do things that hurt me, I should spend my time getting really good at the shit I do well and then trade off my skills for the things I can't do.

 Perfect example -- I'm a good cook, but I can't stand in the kitchen long enough to cook AND do dishes (between the hot water and the standing, it drives my POTS crazy). I cook and manage the food budget for me and my two roomies, and they clean up. 

Another example, my boyfriend is a brilliant mathematician and chemist, and he is physically very strong; I am neither. However, he really struggles with executive functioning (we suspect, and are in the diagnostic process, for autism). He was also raised in a *less then supportive* environment and so he is terrified of doing anything that qualifies as ""adulting"". So I help him with job searches and setting up doctors' appointments (and sometimes with writing essays), while he does the laundry and helps me with my homework. And we can both cook, so we often bicker about who is stuck with the dishes :P

Life is already fuckin' hard enough. Fighting your limitations is the human experience TO A POINT, but not to where you put yourself in harm's way. And honestly, I'm doing pretty damn good, in a lot of ways because of the paths my disabilities have led me down; I've learned about medicine to help myself when I'm sick, now I'm studying for the MCAT. I study music because I could never do sports, and it's brought so many great people into my life. Find a balance and people who are willing to trade skillsets with you. That is so much more important than trying to push past ""false limitations"" that ableists think we put on ourselves (and yeah, I hate to say it, but its definitely a form of passive/internalized ableism).

Feel free to reach out if you ever want a buddy your age. I know, at least where I live, disabled folks our age are hard to come by, and that can be pretty isolating.
No problem, I only recently found out that it’s an official organization instead of just a general name for any disability focused sport"
p0074,"What do you do when both partners in a relationship are disabled, and you both need help, but you can't help each other?",25,disability,"Comparing is never good! That only causes problems. Do not listen to people saying that, only you can judge that. People on Reddit are quick to say things like that.

I hope you get good results from the MRI, maybe something that is fixable. Hopefully with physiotherapy maybe."

p0076,Survival Jobs are not disability friendly.,192,disability,"I feel this. I can’t stand for basically any period of time without assistance (from mobility aids or walls/people) and I have massive brain fog issues. I also have an amnesia disorder so I have a really hard time remembering things. I can’t have a job where I need to stand (so most retail) or take orders and things. I worked retail for a while, but I had to call out a lot for pain or other chronically ill things. Luckily for that job they let me sit down, but I hated strict cashier days.

Before my disability got really bad, I used to be a teacher and I was forgetting things constantly, and when I asked for more time to get grading done (because I would literally forget it was there) they told me that no one else has a hard time so I just needed to buckle down and do it. This came from the same vice principal who asked me what having accommodations would do for me in the job 🙄 not to mention my chronic fatigue and insomnia would lead to me having micro naps sometimes, or the one time where I passed out in front of the students.

While I’m glad I don’t have to worry about that any more, some people act like I’m happy that my college degree is going to waste"
p0077,"good desk chairs? muscle, spine, & circulation/nerve problems",1,disability,"My HM chair has been an actual life changer. I have so much less pain and neuropathy now. There was a period in the first two months where it was much worse as my body slowly readapted to being in the correct posture and I was convinced I'd made a horrible mistake but it's actually given me a lot of mobility back. That said a lot of those clearance sites are scams. What you can do if find them often in used office supply stores and the parts are readily available
I have EDS and hypermobility and I mostly sit on a mat or cushion on the floor."
