>I'm not going to let him treat me like she treated him.

oof
>>”We’re siblings we should be united”

Shoulda thought that before your cheating wife convinced you otherwise
It's insane to me that he thought he could just show up at her house, unannounced, and be welcomed with open arms. After years of refusing to even so much as text her.
Don't you just love how he suddenly remembered siblings have to be united when he cut her off and didn't even bother to come for her wedding? Nah, he should maintain that energy. "

Looks like his parents are POS as well as the husband himself. And for his gf being pregnant too, well good luck to her.
When she said he broke in and wasn't telling I thought he was going to try and kill her but lost his nerve. What that statistic about pregnant womens leading cause of death being their partner? 


I hope he just goes away and never bothers her or the baby.
He flipped the switch as soon as he felt he had her trapped because of the baby and sincerely thought that she wouldn't leave him because of it. He was so sure of it that he showed no remorse, dismissed her emotions, and downplayed his own actions. He was a bomb waiting to go off no matter what happened.
Sounds VERY much like something I have second hand experience with.  Turns out it was meth

My story is probably unbelievable for most...I'd like to share it, but I have no idea where."

I’m Filipino and yes this is set in the PH. I’m doubting this story because you can’t file an annulment in two days. You need a lawyer (and the process of retaining a lawyer can take a bit of time) and a psych evaluation of one of the parties (assuming the reason is psychological incapacity, the most common reason for annulment). Only then will you be able to file a petition to get an annulment.
My doubts begin to show when supposedly both sides explain their stories. Cause both sides have very similar writing style.
This is so Philippines. The drama might seem exaggerated, but we're hella dramatic, and yes everyone here is terminally online so I wouldn't be surprised if Sarah's cousin did stumble on the mom's post.

The bio dads a pos obviously but the mom really needs to step it up to protect her kid. How is she not going after child support and using the courts to protect and provide for her kid?
Does this girl ever get out of the house, except to go from one household to another? She goes to virtual school and is looking for an online job. She doesn't mention friends, just cousins. I feel sorry for her.

I keep telling myself I'm going to quit following this, but here I am...
I don't even care if it's fake at this point, I'm just here for the drama. If it is fake, I like the writing style, I feel like the clichés are handled well.

If it's real, then damn! My sympathy to OOP.
People kept commenting how this was like a Law & Order episode, but they’re wrong. This is basically a General Hospital story.

Will Luke find out he's not the father to any of Amy's kids and try groveling back to OOP?

Will Amy and Luke attack each other, because they work better as affair partners and the divorce is making things too real for them?

That moment when OP said, ""I couldn't be with someone who couldn’t answer this simple question"" is just so telling. Like, if love is that hard to define, maybe it's time to move on.

NTA. There is no place to agree or disagree. John chose his path of allowing racism and your mother is choosing John. I am so sorry that this happened to you. You are right -- you thought you were at home. Now it appears you were just visiting your parent's house. Your mother should be ashamed not only of condoning the racism but also for not providing a child (even an adult child) a safe place to land.
NTA. John should have stood up for you. At the very least he should have walked away without laughing. I might have let it go if John hadn't have tacked on, ""he tells it like it is."" But after that everything absolutely went down hill.
NTA, as a person of color who almost exclusively moves in white spaces, this IS a hill to die on. My husband (white) is currently NC with his mom and stepdad because of his stepdad's raging racism and his mom's refusal to say anything to him about it to 'keep the peace.' You don't have to be combative about it or feel the need to educate the ignorant but still, the proper amount of racism to tolerate is always 0%.
NTA 


He's just telling it like it is means ""I agree"" does it not? Otherwise I think he'd say something else like ""he's just a racist idiot but we tolerate him because we can't move"" or something"

Amy’s son is gonna blow up her life and she deserves it. He’s driven and upset.
I really hope this is fake. Poor woman
Ahhh. So she took the notes offered and realized the paternity test would have to be later in the season.   

Gotta say, didn’t expect her to break it open with a simple “he forgot to delete years of affair evidence” to back up her lack of any reason to suspect an affair except bad vibes and some similar colouring. 

She definitely missed the mark on a grown man going a night and almost an entire day of without coming back for his phone, but maybe she will come back with a “he was using his work phone while he was away and that is why he didn’t come back for his electronics until close to 3pm”.   Did he have to use an actual alarm clock to wake up in the morning at his parents’ house?

Surely Cat knows there is proof of the affair by now and has shared it with her husband so her FIL still saying he isn’t sure doesn’t sit right….. unless he is having sex with Amy (but not fathering children). Or maybe Amy is his daughter!!!  😮

I like the speed of the updates and the story is pretty good and fairly believable most of the time.  8/10.  Looking forward to tomorrow’s episode

I snuck into an empty meeting room and got to see what everyone makes at my workplace. ,1225,TrueOffMyChest,"That’s what’s great about working for the State. Everyone’s salaries are published on the internet. What’s not great about working for the state? When first starting out, salaries are historically low because taxpayer dollars are utilized to fund employees. You need to work for about 10-15 years to start earning a wage to smile about.
Could there be prior work history or education that accounts for the difference? 

I’ve ran into a situation where a coworker found out I made more for the same job title but failed to realize I had years more experience than he did.
I've worked in payroll for over 20 years. I know what everyone makes from the mail room employees, to the CEO. I know what the person down the hall from me makes, I know what my boss makes and what her boss makes.

I've done this at three different companies.  Two of them I felt the compensation was relatively fair. Sure there were some people that I questioned how on earth they made what they did, but otherwise relatively ok.

One place however was a nonprofit mental health company.  There I could not BELIEVE the variance in pay rates.  People doing the same jobs but way different rates.  Someone with 20-25 years under their belt making less than new hires in the same/similar positions.
I always freely share my salary information and so do most of my coworkers.  Thanks to my male coworkers, I went into a salary negotiation quite well prepared and ended up getting ~20k more than the initial offer as a result.  Knowledge is power!
Many years ago, I did something similar just went in the bosses office after hours and read everybody’s file.
I quit soon after when they wouldn’t give me a raise.
If they’re dumb enough to leave things like that, laying around where people can read them that’s their problem."
I told my dad’s coworker’s daughter not to go to medical school. ,1131,Residency,"Reminds me of the adage that much of advice is ""someone talking to their younger self.""
I tell people “If you’re split between medicine and something else (finance, tech, etc) just do the other thing.” 

But I do feel like there’s so many doctors on Reddit who romanticize jobs outside of medicine when in reality they’d be just as stressed and dissatisfied and wouldn’t be making 250-500k a year. 
I have yet to meet someone whose job is low stress, fulfilling, high paying, realistically obtainable, and has good job security. I’m not convinced that job exists.
My dad asked me to talk to a 16 year old, family friends daughter. I told him no, saying that right now in the thick of it I wouldn’t choose this again, I really don’t have anything positive to say about it. Maybe in 10 years it’ll be worth it, but right now I’m fucking miserable. He goes “why would you crush her dreams?” And I said “that’s why I’m refusing to talk to her” 😂
I hate it but I literally don’t know what else I would do if not this so I guess I’m here
I mean, yeah it's tough, but it's also a career that is satisfying, has a lot of social capital, pays well, and is very stable. I also don't encourage people go to into it heedless of the trade-offs, but I'm also not blind to the upsides."
ChatGPT is kind of making people stupid at my workplace,963,ExperiencedDevs,"The problem is that once you accept ChatGPT Jockey as your true role, your solution to the problems caused by ChatGPT will be to throw more ChatGPT at it.


It's good to be lazy when you can, it's bad to be lazy when you can't. 


I've found that if you can't get ChatGPT to work on the first couple of tries that it isn't worth going down the prompt refinement rabbit hole. Better to just write it yourself at that point. 
I don’t think ChatGPT causes people to suddenly regress in their skills. It definitely *enables* lazy people to be as lazy as possible though. This might simply be coworkers revealing themselves for who they are. 

I doubt you’ll have any success trying to attack ChatGPT as the root cause. You need to focus on what matters: Code quality, sustainable architecture, and people submitting code they understand and can reason about. When these things aren’t happening, hold people accountable.
Last week I saw a guy on my team write a custom implementation of binary search from scratch so he could search a list of 10 items. He spent 50 lines on his implementation. The specific problem he was trying to solve could be trivially solved by a single pass for-loop. I wondered if he copy/pasta'd his binary search solution from an LLM.

While I was wondering, another engineer saw the binary search in peer review, and proposed his own solution. It was a fancy one-liner that wasn't very readable. The one-liner wasn't very intuitive, and not something I would reach for as my first solution. LLM again?

So I loaded the use case into 4o GPT, and it spat out verbatim engineer #2's one-liner. I then loaded it into the free version of GPT, and it spat out engineer #1's binary search.

It was uncanny.
I think it's just exposing the fact that they already are.
I don't know how people can do this. Any GPT code I've tried to use takes more effort to review and understand than if I wrote it myself. 

It's great for boilerplate and format conversion though!"

Did I do update right? Or should I edit my post for it? 

Update: Thank you for all the kind comments and suggestions. You are right, I should trust my husband in what he’s doing, and I will. But as some of you pointed out, her behavior is alarming, and she might need a mental health check. If this continues, she could harm both me, my husband, and herself in the process. I will ask him what he plans to do next after going NC. If he intends to go NC further, I want to suggest that he ask his relatives to check on her mental health. I don’t know if my MIL will agree, though.

But honestly, I hope it’s just her difficult behavior rather than a mental health issue, because even now, I wouldn’t wish that on her. I’ve read some medical articles about mentally ill patients, and it’s very scary.
This sounds like an undiagnosed mental disorder. You can compassionately go low contact and suggest she seek help.


I would consider a 6 to 12 month ""time out"" and then reevaluate. Skip birthdays and holidays. 
So odd. Some weird twisted control issue maybe?

I'm trying to imagine the look on her face if you sport the eye patch next time you see her.
Follow your husband's lead and go NC, he knows best 

Also, this is definitely a mental illness issue but if her family knows it's untreatable and there's nothing anyone can do than trust them, they've been dealing with it a lot longer"

I definitely preferred roommates to my parents. And I don't have a bad relationship with my parents, but their house is a lot smaller than the one I was able to split with people my own age and not all roommates suck.


Never even mind the financial aspect of this. OP seems to think of every option like ""you can afford it or you can't"" instead of a spectrum of choices with different financial impacts and tradeoffs.

*Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level, and beat you with experience.* 

- Mark Twain, others
My people (Dine\`) have a saying: ""You cannot wake up a man who is pretending to sleep.""

I learned the hard way too. You can't really debate or whatever, because they aren't engaging honestly or with integrity. They are there specifically to make a show of arguing with you that they imagine their god will see and later praise them for. 

They are like a playground junior bully who fights you and then looks to see if the big bully was watching.

So, what you do is you is you meet them impassively on topics of belief: ""I understand that you hold certain beliefs. I am not interested in discussing them. I live my life based on evidence, and tangible observations I have made with my own senses.""

**And, if they escalate to threats (even far fetched ones like telling you to get raped by islam), you pretend like you think it's real.** 

You go to HR and say ""so and so threatened to have me raped"" 

And/Or you go to the police and you say ""my coworker has told me that I deserve to be raped. I don't feel safe. I would like to file a report, so that there is a record if things escalate. I believe I am being targeted for \[religion/autism/race - use only if applicable\]""

I'm not going to lie when I say that wearing nice smell fragrances on a daily basis has increased my luck in life.
I hope you will get used to your new place and feel better. I live in Europe, cannot imagine what it will be like to live in the US.
For me my mental health went downhill fast after getting completely into fragrances a month ago. It was a escape from reality, I just disappeared for a month, didn't see anyone etc. 
And I can relate to smelling all of your perfumes when you are bored lol 😅

For those still in limbo about whether or not to have kids,259,collapse,"My 70yo father is baffled by this, and doesn't understand how even to talk about it. I can pick up the hints in various contexts to get enough of a sense that it is bothering him. Two healthy, stable adult children, and neither showing any interest in ""carrying on the family line."" But I've decided that if he won't ask it straight, I'm not going to offer any explanation.

He does, however, seem to be wrapping his head around how super fucked the future is.

Also, his girlfriend has 3 sons (in their 40s, bit older than me and my sister) who hardly ever talk to her. One won't arrange to let her visit the new grandchild. So shout out to the boomers who staked their whole lives on kids taking care of them.
 I really love nature and get so much peace from it. Having to watch more and more nature disapear as every inch of this planet gets converted to suit the needs of ever more humans has always been my reason to not have any.
If you want kids, adopt. There is no shortage of suffering orphans in need of a caring family. That's actually a form of harm reduction unlike birthing yet more humans into an overstressed planet.
I’m 48, and my husband is 50. Neither one of us had kids before we married, and  before we married (in 2010) we discussed the matter. Neither of us wanted kids. He got a vasectomy, we got married, and we’ve been together for about 15 years now. 

Imma be honest: I don’t like kids, and neither does my husband. It never really went any deeper than that, and we have never once regretted it. 

And ever since we became collapse aware, we thank our lucky stars that we made that decision because, quite frankly, it would be downright cruel to bring a child into this world now. 

These arguments have been around a lot longer than many have even been aware of collapse. None of them have ever been good justifications for having kids. 

The first point you’ve addressed is enough: ‘there has always been suffering’

YUP. How about not bring a kid into it? We used to get harassed for not having kids. We were accused of being ‘selfish’… but there is nothing more selfish than to know that life has always been full of suffering yet insisting to bring a child into it anyway.
I know very few good people.  Most are selfish, inept, incurious and irresponsible.  I come from a large family, and every single other member exhibits at least three of those traits.  How could I ever forgive myself for creating yet another of those cretins?

Case in point, just this weekend I lent a seemingly experienced family member a brand new chainsaw for a project, the project mainly being questionably useful deforestation, all the tools that go with it, lubricant, the instruction manual and a tool bag to carry all of it.  What I got back was several disassembled parts, no tools, no manual, and no bag.  It ""fell apart"" when they were using it, and apparently that is my fault.  In a more just world, the tree would have fallen on them."

What is your profession and what side of our patriarchal society have you seen? ,214,fourthwavewomen,"Flight attendant 

- families traveling together and parents in separated seats, it is ALWAYS the women staying with the kids 

- A lot of work place relationships/situationships + Weird power dynamics. Pilots and first officers are overwhelmingly male and cabin crew is overwhelmingly female. 

- disruptive passengers are almost always men, a lot of them drunk. Flying to and from party destinations is a nightmare precisely because of groups of drunk men

- weirdly fetishized job. men trying to take sneak pictures of the flight attendants. I have had two men be forced out by other male crew bc they wanted a picture with me and didn’t accept a no.
I'm a high school English teacher. A few thoughts:

1. Male teachers have an easier time dealing with parents. Parents are less likely to melt down, scream at, curse at, or harass male teachers than female ones. 

2. When a girl has a crush on a male teacher, everyone thinks it's funny or cute and the male might feel a little worried that someone will think he's up to no good. When a boy has a crush on me, I feel trapped and intimidated. They will often be pushy and invade my personal space and basically stalk me and be in my room all the time when it's not appropriate (like before school, pretending to have questions or need help, but it's bs). If I try to firmly reject them, they get angry and yell at me or try to get me in trouble with the principal by saying I'm mean or that I hate them. This doesn't happen when girl students have a crush on male teachers. 

3. Other staff and parents have frequently made passes at me or shared inappropriate stories with me about sex. I am expected to brush this off and not be ""sensitive."" I feel vulnerable alone in my classroom because male staff will come and block me in (stand in the doorway) to ""chat"" and waste my time, but I feel I must be nice to avoid them getting angry with me. Dads will hit on me when we are alone in my room, and I don't know what to do because I am expected to meet with parents in my room, not in a common space. When I tell other women I am uncomfortable and say what male staff has said and done to me, they say those men are just lonely and not to worry about it.

4. I am not given the proper time or space to handle my period concerns or bathroom needs. I must wear a super flow tampon WITH a large pad to make it until my one prep period and then again until the final bell. I get frequent utis due to having to hold my bladder for that long as well. Nobody cares about this problem and there is no reliable way to get another adult to watch my class if I need to go to the bathroom.
Social work, specialising in safeguarding in mental health.

We spend hours in lecture halls learning about anti oppressive practice and then we bounce off into our jobs and continue using the language whilst we engage in the very oppression we're supposed to proudly oppose. 

A few years ago there was an article which included a few lines which sum up how the system works and which I have printed out and had on the wall over every desk I have worked from since:

>Another client has a meeting with social workers. Her children are on the child protection register due to domestic abuse perpetrated by their father. The social worker is reviewing the list of things their mum must do under the safety plan. There are 14 things on the list. The father, the reason we are all there, isn’t even required to turn up to the meeting.
Hospitalist. Almost 99.99% carers are women.
My side hustle works with the wedding industry. I have yet to meet a bride who’s future husband actually wants to be with her. It’s just one big party for him, usually all week, he doesn’t help prep for the wedding, so many brides get soooooo burnt out from everyone else’s bullshit including invasive and pushy in-laws. I haven’t met a “bridezilla” yet. 
I’ve also worked as a caregiver for both young and old. Sleep deprivation was always the number one type of abuse the men in the house used against women. If I was helping with a disabled kid/young adult who needed constant supervision(I was there to make sure mom could get a nap) the dad would go wake her up “because the kid would be up soon”. Men will weaponize anyone and anything."
Dog sitting is the real golden goose,204,beermoney,"I can vouch for this, at least via Rover. We have a medium sized house with a large fenced yard in a smallish city. Maybe we just found the perfect market, but the demand seems to be bottomless. We've made $12-15 grand a year the past three years and it could be more if my wife would charge market rate (she's too nice). Sometimes it can feel like a second job if we overbook, but for the most part it's pretty passive income (aside from the poop duty, which is... voluminous). It's absolutely worth trying out if you like dogs.
Just a comment on the save for tax day tip. You should actually do estimated payments if you are making any appreciable money doing this. Saving money for tax day isn’t always gonna cut it for everyone.
No shit! I want to go out of town soon, but it cost an arm and a leg for someone to stop by for 30 min a day and make sure my Miss kitty is ok! :/
I do Rover & love it. Great side income & don’t have to leave my house.
As someone who ran a dog boarding business before Rover was a thing, yes it can be decentish money. We started ours in 2009 and ran it until we changed locations in 2017. My wife and I were doing approx. 400k in revenue on the business, supporting 6 additional dog walkers on 1099s. We sold the business w/ client list when we moved. I just wanted to add a little perspective.

In my current city, GOOD LUCK making ANY money on rover. There are literally 100000000000 dog boarders and walkers with high ratings and bottom-feeding pricing. It would take me a long time to rebuild the business here. We have opted for other ways to make money. I am glad you have found success there!

One point I vehmently disagree with, and that is purchasing crates and using them. If the dog uses a crate at their home, they should bring that with. If they don't they should not be crated at your house. People choose in-home boarding to avoid a kennel experience. If you crate them based on your opinion and not theirs, that is a good solid way to get negative feedback and loss of a client.

Lastly, if you are boarding dogs AND working a full time job, this becomes dicey if you start to scale. My wife ran the boarding business out of the home and it WAS her job, so she was present with the animals. If you are scaling and watching, oh lets say, 7 dogs at any given time, you cannot just leave the home. I personally would not use you (no offense) if you were going to work all day and leaving my dog in a crate. He doesn't use a crate at home and the whole reason we choose in-home boarding (and still do to this day) is him being around people and socializing. If we wanted a kennel, we would use a kennel. I am not talking NOT leaving the home at all, I am just saying an 8 hour shift style work.

With all that said, this list does contain great hints on how to do this, so I wish you well in your journey. It is a super rewarding gig."
"For Everyone Going Through a Breakup, Read This",184,BreakUps,"Thank u . Some days are good some days are bad . But during those bad days like today , these message keeps me going .
It’s difficult when this person you loved was still behaving the same as always, and thus seemingly still deserving of your love, and then suddenly break up and show their true face. You can’t just switch off that desire to give them love and attention, and receive their love and attention, so suddenly. My ex had stopped loving me but pretended to for about a month. When we broke up she jumped to another guy immediately. I still hung around for a month, as I was not ready to let go yet, but I recently broke off all contact finally. It’s devastating to lose someone you’ve known and loved for years in just one short month.
I'm 5 months out of a 7 year relationship, and it's been really hard. I still live with my ex too. Feels like I'll never find someone who loves me again. I wish he did. I am right where you were, like he's upset, lashing out at me and everything, but why can't we just live in peace and harmony? I was so stupid to think that that could just happen. I'm not ready to let go, and I know that. It's been super hard for me. 
i always read such quotes and messages->revalidate my actions/feelings->decide not to care anymore and move on BUT THEN I FORGET all this and start caring/try to talk to them again😭😭😭
what do i do HELPPPP i always forget the bad things/bad qualities about them and try to understand and love them and forgive them
Thank you for this. I'm 2 months out of a 4 year relationship where I was the one loving enough for both of us. The quote you shared really resonates because I begged for less than the bare minimum and only received abuse. That forced relationship didn't last. I'm realizing now that this person never cared for or loved me at all. I was convenient to him. Although that hurts quite a bit, I now know I deserve so much more. I deserve to be built up, not broken down. The more I look back at everything, the more I realize how horrible he really was, and now I was spared when he broke up with me. Knowing now who he truly is, I can move forward without regrets. I tried my best and all the issues lie with him. 

I'm also moving next week! I've been staying in the house we bought together (he moved out because he got with the girl he cheated on me with and couldn't bring her to our house with me there). It's exciting and terrifying but it's a huge step forward for me."

My man, this is definitely TL:DR.
Industry response: TLDR"
"People need to stop telling others who are suffering from Mental Illness, that their disease is the result of a Demonic Possession or Spiritual Warfare, that can be permanently cured by not going to therapy, but simply and solely by prayer.",139,Christianity,"I agree that it sounds ludicrous to label medical conditions as demonic. If something is a demon then it's a demon but there are many medical conditions that are diagnosed as medical conditions.

I say this because as a schizophrenic person, my medications are able to treat my depression and schizophrenia. If the illnesses are demonic, then medications wouldn't be able to treat me.
As someone who works with people with disabilities, I always found this to be one of the most damaging aspects of Christianity.
This is the realest perspective from someone struggling with mental health (that's also Christian) that I've seen in a minute. Most people could genuinely be struggling and then try to raw-dog their way through life; No therapy, no meds, no support, NOTHING. It's so refreshing to see someone struggling with mental health actually point out the hypocrisy of a lot of Christians. I'm black and come from a Baptist denomination and people in that denomination are so judgmental. Especially the older generation. I'm glad to see times are changing when it comes to mental health and I as well have suffered with OCD. I  have ADHD and Autism in addition to OCD and have gotten all types of comments about how ""it's just the devil"" and I should pray it away and that type of rhetoric amongst church folk is so unhelpful and ableist.

That was very well said!  I totally agree with you!"
I’ve been single for five years and genuinely feel like I’ve been hit with extraordinary bad luck for no reason? ,124,AskWomenOver30,"I’m just going to float a controversial opinion here:

The reason women are struggling with dating so much is because men have not progressed at the same rate as us. Think about it: for generations, we’ve had to marry to just “get by” in life. It wasn’t so long ago that we couldn’t work, vote, choose our life etc etc. Even in our parents and grandparents generations the norm was to quickly marry out of high school and start popping out kids - sure there are outliers who chose to also have a career or travel but they’re far less common than they are now. Throughout all of this, we’ve had to be the emotional caretaker of our relationships - remember this, it’s important. It’s our “job” to “take care” of the man and the house and our well-being and appearance. 

Cut to present: really over the last two generations we’ve seen a complete shift in the way women are choosing to live. More of us than ever are choosing a childfree life, choosing a career, choosing to travel. We can have all those things now without being “controversial”. Women have had to build strength and independence rapidly to adapt and enjoy all these freedoms we can now have without judgement. But we still have the emotional and mental strength of earlier generations imparted in us. Essentially what that means is we now have several generations of women who are mentally and emotionally strong, smart, driven, independent, and able to make their own choices in life. 

On the flip side, men have been sort of blindsided with this development and it’s becoming increasingly clear to me that they don’t know how/are unable to adapt to this new generation of women. The overwhelming majority of men still have ingrained patriarchal views, lack of emotional intelligence (because they’ve been raised to expect a woman to take care of them), a hugely problematic tendency to sexualise and objectify us, and an overall total lack of ability to relate to and celebrate the monumental shift women have been able to achieve in recent generations. I think many quietly hate that we no longer “need” them. 

*I do have to make the obligatory “not all men” statement as there are plenty out there who love the fact that it’s a new world for us and we are considerably less oppressed. I also have to include “not all women” as sadly there are so many countries/cultures where we are still denied freedom and basic rights. I’m generalising here*

Overall, I find it rare to meet men where there are not issues with boundaries, consent, objectification, and the expectation of emotional caretaking. 

I can only hope that in time, men finally start to understand that the old ways of relating to women are not acceptable anymore. When they fully embrace a more equal mindset towards relationships then I believe we will have an easier time in dating.
Are you are me 😂 34 and have not had any type of relationship last for more than a few months over the past 4.5 years. It feels like one big cosmic joke sometimes. I have my sh*t together financially, physically and my mental health is pretty great recently. 

Everyday I’m actively working on bettering myself in some way. I’ve done online dating but quit at the start of this year and have been focusing on real life meetups. I’m at the gym five days week. I taught myself to cook good, healthy food. I spend time with my friends and family. I’ve joined a meetup group. I’ve taken up more hobbies. I’ve said “yes” to social gatherings I’d usually blow off etc. the list goes on. It’s not like I don’t get interest from guys but the ones who do show interest seemingly have heaps of issues they need to sort out (mental health, financial stuff, kids with exes). 

It almost feels like the more I work on myself/improve my life the more glaringly obvious it is that so many haven’t done that same work. It’s exhausting. I know nobody’s perfect but wow do some people choose not to work on bettering themselves. 

I don’t have any advice other than I FEEL YOU. Tbh I think a lot of dating and finding that one person is pure luck and circumstance.
I read this on the happy and single subreddit, but someone said ""dating is not a reward."" And it's SO true. 


Like truly you can max out every aspect of your life, and there won't be some golden man waiting there as a trophy for you. People find their partners at many random points in their lives. Broken unhealthy people can find relationships. I used to think like you and I would beat myself up over what I was ""doing wrong"". But sometimes the answer is literally - nothing. Luck and timing attributes to 99% of the process. Just keep on enjoying your life in the mean time!
My theory is that with each life improvement you make, you are setting yourself up for disappointment when you meet a person who has not taken the steps to actually improve their lives.  I have definitely been on the receiving end of interested people and dates, but I would turn them around because they were not the right person.  Is it bad luck or are you just more selective?  And do you really want to lower your standards?
Sounds like you live somewhere that you're not a good fit for. The biggest game changer I ever experienced was moving to a city where I fit in really well. I would absolutely recommend that to anyone in your situation."

Very well said!!! 👋👋👋

I was the only person in my family of origin that thought things were fucked up. Everytime I tried to point it out, I was attacked and targeted. It's the same with all toxic groups of people. Those brainwashed into the toxic dysfunction will defend the toxic homeostasis, rather than disrupt it. It's sickening. Our only option is to break free.
This is so well written it should be in a textbook.
Well said. Narcissistic abuse really is crazy making. The result of having a Nparent in the family is that no one is mentally sound. Everyone exhibits dysfunctional behaviors and struggles with mental health problems. When everyone is crazy, chaos naturally ensues on a regular basis. I tried to save my sibling and my other parent, but they weren’t willing to stand up to the Nparent. They just wanted to keep the peace and asked me to do the same. I can’t though. I will never tolerate any abuse or disrespect from anyone again. I ended up blocking my entire family to preserve my sanity.
So true.

Narcissists put me in mind of the kind of mushroom that brainwashes ants."
Casual misogyny is our second name (Long),116,MalayalamMovies,"It is so disappointing to see so many comments downplaying things, justifying that some of these men are just 'kozhis', asking what if they were just 'flirting', what if these allegations are just a way of seeking attention and on and on. It's heartbreaking that even now, in 2024, the first reaction of some people is to assume the victim is lying. Why? Do we only care about victims if they die?
The disappointing part is that these comments are said by people that are young. Older people saying these kinda things are expected but not surprising, but they are not the current generation, they are not long for this world. But the young people saying this means misogyny is still common among us youth and they are blaming women for assaults against them and they are gone pass this charming worldview to their kids.
Technically, I believe both to a certain extent. Men often downplay significant issues, while women frequently aggrandise trivial matters.

"A brief Lore summary of Hoolay and Feixiao, as well as some CN discussions about the implications of 2.5 story",109,HonkaiStarRail,"I agree with the conclusion of Feixiao not being a emanator. When it comes to discussing the generals being emanators, the best assumption is that the sprits given to them are the emanators and need a host to weld them.
When they call her the ""Merlin's Claw,"" is that a reference to the wizard or the bird of prey?
This lore gives so many parallels to Dan Shu, who in a way is relatable to feixiao. Both are cursed with something that's uncurable, both are/ were well respective in their field, and both lost a dear friend to Lan and his Lux arrow.

You can also say she is similar to Jiaoqui, who are both healers who have become dillusional over lan's war against the abominations of the abundance, and have to deal with a permanent disability.

The difference between the three could be how they approached loss from war. jiaoqui is always questioning it whenever he had to deal with saving lives but chooses to continue pursuing the healing arts, feixiao chooses to continue fighting to find the possible peace. Dan Shu however chose to fight Lan and follow the sanctus medicus as she believed she has lost too much of everything. 

This storyline feels like a spiritual successor to the Dan Shu plot by giving examples of characters who have been dealt the same way she did. In another way this storyline may have subtley fleshed out Dan Shu's motivations and desires as well through letting us see the perspectives of feixiao and jiaoqui.

I think it's getting worse,101,ForeverAlone,"Very well written and digestible - The Atlantic should publish you instead.
Tried to DM you, but god damn this is one of the best posts, no one of the best written things I've read in a long, long time.
[deleted]
An interesting post, and I would agree with many of the conclusions you've come to. Personally, I've never been a fan of the commonly given advice that we just need to learn to love ourselves and to be happy alone. It's not necessarily wrong advice, yes we should try to find happiness whenever we can, but the fact is that there is simply nothing that can truly provide a substitute for a relationship, no matter what we try.

I don't think it's wrong to say that for most of us here, finding a relationship would be a genuinely transformative experience. Having that close connection with someone, being able to share emotional and physical intimacy, and being able to share our lives with that person would massively improve our confidence, self-esteem and general emotional state. Most of us probably have past experiences of being socially rejected, being picked last for social groups and generally feeling like we never fitted in socially. To be able to have someone actively choose to share those experiences with us and specifically us, when they could have so many other options, would be the greatest compliment possible. It wouldn't fix all of our problems, but would help an awful lot.

It's quite common for people to say that meeting their partner was the best thing that ever happened to them and that they wouldn't know how to live without that person. This is seen as a lovely, romantic thing to say. However for those of us who are alone, it's instead seen as wrong for us to admit that finding a relationship would improve our lives and we are told that we should find happiness in isolation instead. I don't believe that is truly possible. have you ever met someone who was single for their entire life not by their own choice and was actually genuinely happy? I haven't, because we aren't meant to live like this.
I think you're conflating something different from this article and trying to relate it to yourself.

The article has a paywall in my case, but from what I've read, it's not geared to forever alone users. I think it's geared towards the type of individuals that may have issues with codependency and defining themselves based on whether they are in a relationship or not. 

As for some of your analysis, I think the most powerful thing to realize about social media, which includes reddit, is that none of it is free. Your attention is how you pay. 

What gets the most attention? Negativity, misery, and ultimately, creating an echo chamber where everyone around you thinks just like you. That's why I don't pay too much attention to the random posts where it's an entire gender hating another. It becomes an issue when people read that and think, ""Eureka! They all do hate me!""
I've seen it with those pill podcasts using it to justify hating and taking advantage of the opposite sex and I've seen people use it to justify a latent fear. 

One thing about humans is that we are constantly evolving and changing. Dating apps might have been popular before, but people change and realize that approach isn't best. That doesn't mean dating is over. It means that people have taken other avenues. I was just listening to the Intelligence Report a few days ago, and they highlighted the rise of in person matching services. That's one example of the new ways that are growing in popularity.

It's possible to take back some power in a male-dominated workplace.,87,BlueCollarWomen,"This is probably the best ""standing up for my shift/what's right"" story I have ever heard. Please keep us updated, I wanna know how it went down and if you are gonna get ice cream. Be sure to request the good stuff to make up for lost rewards.
I work as the only woman in a 35~ person staff.

I had a subordinate say ""thanks mommy"" when I gave him new work shirts.
I ended up completely flipping out in front of an equal and other subordinates by threatening to gut him with a box cutter outside if he wanted to disrespect me. 

We've maintained a very professional atmosphere since. 🤷

Your mileage may vary.
I don’t get what your overall work/ production issues have to do with being in a “male-dominated workplace”, OP. Just seems like you have weird management. It sucks, but unfortunately management and ownership decide how they want to run it.

My only advice is to be careful. You’re playing a very dangerous game— especially if you’re not protected by a union. Workers who speak out about injustices more often than not tend to get shit canned instead of having their concerns addressed.

In my experience, unless the company is breaking the law, stirring things up could get you laid off. It’s happened to me.
I was putting away my toolbox at the end of shift one morning when one of the old guys from the incoming shift said that seeing me carrying my tools like that almost made me look like I was a real Compounder (we both had that same job title). I didn't drop a second before I turned to look directly at him and told him to shut the hell up or I'd run him over in the parking lot. Just the idea that he felt comfortable to tell me I was playing dress up at our job just couldn't end well for him.
I think not speaking up is pretty common in male dominated spaces. They grumble but nothing ever changes in their view so dont try. Men also defer to authority more, in my experience, but I have never worked in female dominated environments, so might be human expeience. 

I was often asked by crew to bitch/put stuff forward to our boss because he would listen to me basically only because he didnt know how to tell a woman no. 

Not everyone can take a hit but how long would you put up working in that environment before you spoke up or moved on? Not speaking out is precisely how this stuff never gets resolved."

I Feel Extremely Guilty,76,NDE,"It seems you are ready to forgive your father for what he did wrong, due to his upbringing and yet you can't do the same for yourself?

Show yourself the same empathy.

From what I have read in NDE stories, everything is as it should be and your father knows this now and has long since forgiven you and himself.
Talk to him like he's there with you. He might hear you or be brought the message. 

When my mom had bone cancer and I had to take care of her I blew up at her, too. Except I didn't feel really bad afterward about what I said because what I said needed to be said.

The fact that we are there taking care of them in their most vulnerable time shows we care. A lot of my mom's favorites ditched her for those 3 long years but me, the unwanted one, was there.
I believe he's right there. Listening. He knows.

I recommend you learn how to meditate.

Push away and quiet all the inner turmoil, cacophony and static. Then you can reach out and ask for yourself...
I have not had an NDE, so I can’t answer your questions about where your dad has gone, nor what he may or may not be doing. But as a fellow human who has made mistakes and hurt people, I want to say that your recognition of your own actions and the remorse that you feel speaks to the goodness that’s in you. Try to give yourself some grace, since you can see how difficult your circumstances were at the time you were taking care of your dad. And knowing he took such good care of you in his own time, I’m sure he would want you to be kind to yourself, the person he adored. Take care.
The only thing you can really do is try and learn a lesson from it so that you can avoid feeling that way again. Sometimes guilt can be a good teacher. Guilt and suffering may be unavoidable to a certain extent for many people. I don't think it's possible to fully appreciate someone while they're here. It's only in their absence that their true value is realized. We sometimes hurt the ones we love. We don't always act like we should. Guilt is a good thing, though... trust me. You're better off with it than without it in the end. To do whatever you want and feel no guilt... you couldn't possibly learn anything."
I recently finished reading the biography of Warren Buffett and extracted the key points into a book summary.

Chatgpt summarized your summary, prompted to maximize brevity in point-form:

- Warren Buffett’s early business acumen was evident from selling gum at age 6.
- Influenced by his father, Howard Buffett, he valued honesty, diligence, and independent thinking.
- Educated by Benjamin Graham, Buffett adopted value investing: focus on intrinsic value, margin of safety, and long-term holding.
- Buffett’s unique strategy involved acquiring high-quality businesses and leveraging insurance company cash flows.
- Key investments: American Express, Coca-Cola—emphasized buying undervalued, quality companies for long-term growth.
- Despite wealth, Buffett leads a simple life, valuing meaningful work, relationships, health, and continuous learning.
- Core philosophy: self-investment, integrity, optimism, and long-term thinking drive true success.
If there ever was a post that needed a TL;DR….
I like Buffett but he didn’t sell gum because of any keen business sense. People bought because they knew who his family was.
I've read the book a couple times and absolutely love it. Highly recommend!"

"AI detectors are flawed, and nearly ruined my chances of graduating on time.",60,highschool,"Too many of the people selling AI detectors are like used car salesman who sell all the shiny features and don't talk about the work you have to do to make it run. And too many school people buying them are like the rubes that come on the lot.

For example, Turnitin has some issues, but it isn't just flat""flawed"".

But too many of the people buying it and the way they are using it sure as heck is.

[Even Turnitin says they are NOT a plagiarism checker.](https://www.turnitin.com/blog/does-turnitin-detect-plagiarism)

We all need to learn the details of how the AI detector works, what they are checking against. Turnitin, for example, checks against every paper that has ever been turned in and is stored on the databases it has access to.

Let's say you are writing a paper on Abraham Lincoln's childhood.  How many ways are there to say, ""He grew up in a cabin."" ""Lincoln was born in a one room log cabin...""   If several thousand kids write some form of that sentence and turn it in every year, of COURSE it is going to flag as AI generated.

Did you use Draftback for your time lapse?  If they want, they can use the Brisk AI checker to do the same thing (free trial).  It gives more evidence.

Send the paper and the how to use the tool to the teacher's boss. Be polite.  ""Hey, I think there's an error here and here is the evidence. It will only take a minute to see for yourself. Thank you.""
AI/Plagiarism checkers should not be allowed to be used in grading papers. Period. They report false flags all the time. Teachers are way too lazy to check the work themselves, so they just use AI because they don't want to do their damn job, it's ridiculous.
Report the error to the school or smth, maybe ask ur guidance counselor or ppl to help u
Is it possible that AI is so good at typing like a person that it has become indistinguishable? Like AI thinks it’s AI when a human writes something because AI can do the same thing…

I loved this show. Looking for recommendations?,59,TheTerror,"TV: Yellowjackets. Mindhunter. Chernobyl. Twin Peaks. 11/22/63. In the Flesh. Black Mirror.

Movies: Fargo. The Others.The Mist. Where the Wind Blows.
I highly recommend The Witch (2015) if you liked The Terror.
If you want another few hours of mid 1800 military men eating each other I cannot recommend Ravenous (1999) enough. It’s an experience if nothing else.
Society of the Snow was really good. And it’s more grounded so you get more of that survival aspect.
Yes I do find The Terror to have a somewhat similar tone to the works of Mike Flanagan. Midnight Mass is my favorite Flanagan, followed closely by The Haunting of Bly Manor."
"Sharing my feminist list of games, that the community might find useful 😊",55,GirlGamers,"I don't understand why Hades is neutral but, for example, papers please is not neutral as well
To each their own, but this list doesn't make sense to me. A game can be 'not feminist' due to situations outside of the game's control (such as having a sexist dev or CEO), but to be considered 'feminist' it has to exclusively deal with what OP considers to be 'feminist topics'. That's double standards. Also, I don't think something is or isn't feminist purely based on whether it handles topics of womanhood very specifically. 

What about female creations, or in Hades' case, art specifically drawn by women, in a story where LGBTQ+ themes are strong and respectful. By this logic, a show like Arcane cannot be feminist because the studio that made it or the community that plays the game is full of degenerates. I also think deciding that Bayonetta is decidedly not feminist, when its main character is a strong and independent woman with her own agency, motivations and sexual expression, but papers please be neutral is...a take for sure. This links back into my earlier point too. If Bayonetta cannot be feminist because according to you she's been designed with the 'male gaze' in mind, then why is Hades not feminist for having been designed by women to be sexy for a more feminine audience? What are we supposing feminism means here?
That's a LOT of work y'all have done and I'm surprised you didn't run out of space! 

However I would consider embedding the list of games as an image. As that's a lot of lines / hard work just to get messed up by Reddit's poor formatting system.
Wait how is Elden Ring not at least neutral? If Bloodborne is, I assume the management isn't an issue. 

It has a bunch of female characters who are as powerful as male characters, central to story lines, and gender neutral outfits that don't change much by body type for player characters. I was so happy with the game and the ability to wear full coverage armour. You can wear clothes collected from beings of any gender.

There are a lot of female characters, Melina, Roderika, Latenna, Ranni, Malenia, Marika, Cleanrot knights, Blackknife assassins, Millicent, Nepheli, Fia, Hyetta, Irina, the crones etc. plus even more with the extra content now. I'd say at least 50/50 representation. 

All the characters have distinct motivations, and abilities, as well as styles of dress, there's even disability representation. Multiple characters with prosthesis for example, and characters who are blind but still independent. It plays into the world building, but like Malenia's prosthesis are really detailed, effort was clearly put into design. I don't think they're stereotypical since some are ""villains"", and others are not. They exist on a spectrum of identities.

There isn't a traditional romancing aspect to the game, but female characters can choose the Ranni ending which involves sort of being her partner. Characters gender doesn't explicitly change anything in the story. 

There are a lot of themes that tie into social issues. Complex political situations, wars, family, racism. It's just in a fantasy setting, but you can see commonalities with real world issues like the Holocaust, and general themes of discrimination. 

It's a very good game, and I found the community was good too.

Edit to add: 

You have the option to help stop a man who is perpetrating harm against women and men in the game. To not do so would be seen clearly as a negative. There are pretty clear moral ""dilemmas"" raised in the game. You're made to feel bad if you choose bad options.
as much as i love the effort in this. its way too hard to read :("
"Tania Needs Mental Help, Would Help PETA & Chimps ",51,ChimpCrazyHBO,"She’s has to want it and she does not think there is anything wrong with her. Maybe after all this, light will be shed but so far, she’s doubling down.

As I’ve said in another post, I strongly believe she has borderline personality disorder. That doesn’t just go away with a little therapy. It is highly treatable when the client is motivated. 

It’s a fascinating case study for sure as many of these women have very similar personality traits.
> Tania and the other chimp ladies treated their chimps like kids

I sure hope they don’t lock their kids in basements, keep them drugged on Xanax, or make them wear shock collars. 

Anyone rich enough to afford a chimp can afford mental health care. Sandy (Travis’s owner) was a millionaire. There’s only so much that can be done for people who refuse to get help. PETA’s approach- suing neglectful owners and lobbying for a ban on private chimp ownership- is a much more effective use of their resources.
People with kids in cults also think they are doing the right thing but it isn’t true. There’s lots of situations where people believe they are morally correct when doing unethical things.
I don't buy the Tonia means well narrative. She's an exotic animal broker. She loves the money the animals bring and doesn't care about the about their well-being. She wanted Tonka bc she wanted to have access to at least 1 chimp for selfish reasons- breading, as an attraction at her zoo, just to spite Peta, to sell him later. I don't think she even really liked him that much- after all she hasn't even tried to visit him. She's faking her love him the way she faked being sad that he ""died"".

Well said. I'd like to add to the environmental aspect. Notice while Democrats and Europe in general push for more public transportation, less private transportation, and less public flights; they just happen to exclude themselves from these rules. Really seems to give ""rules for thee, but not for me"" and ""You will own nothing and be happy"" vibes while using environmental ""concerns"" as an excuse.
You see the left were very smart. I feel for it at first too but when looking back I found a pattern.

The thing is the slippery slope is real and the left has mastered it. They start off with small things that everyone can agree on that have an emotional appeal. Once it becomes mainstream accepted they start the process of using it as a wedge to divide the political opponents from those they want to control. They do it slowly with things that make sense and have emotional appeal. Then they ramp up making opponents into something truly evil overtime while holding themselves up as the saviors and hero's. While they are doing that they add in little things that people don't always agree with but the small steps make people not question it because they don't want to be part of the evil side. Eventually, they push it so far people are agreeing with and pushing for things they would never agree with:

Examples - Clinton on abortion: safe, legal, and, rare. The majority agree in extremely rare cases (rape, incest, life of mother) it should be accepted and that it should be as safe as possible. Safe, legal, and rare became safe, legal, and limited. The right raised flags saying they are moving the goal posts, the left says they are trying to force rape victims to carry babies. Then safe, legal, and limited became safe, legal, and choice. The left started removing the limitation to abortion and again the right raised flags. The right was alienated as hands maid tale and those that started to question it was now anti-choice. Now it's safe and a right... creating laws to allow for abortion up to birth and some on the left even arguing post birth and if you don't agree you are after women's bodies and fascists.

You can do the same with climate change, the alphabet mafia, free speech, and illegal immigration. It's a tried and true technic that takes decades to enact but have tricked many into believing they are the morally good, which allows them to commit acts just years previously they would find horrendous. The worst part is they use your own sense of right and wrong to do it with via emotional manipulation.
Their proposed climate change policies are abysmal too. Eat less meat, no flying or private transportation, carbon footprint tracking, etc. They’re using climate change as an excuse to enslave us."
Feeling overwhelmed but I need to find a way to jump into action!,51,MakeupRehab,"I think you've already started working on the most important aspect: identifying the reason your shopping went beyond what you're comfortable with, and actively addressing that reason. For that alone, I applaud you!!!

There is no rule that says you have to declutter. If you're not ready to, that's ok. With the work you're putting in, you might find yourself more able to let things go a little later down the line. It's great that you have an awareness that you'll never be able to get through it all. Enjoy your makeup in whatever capacity you choose to, and I hope you can continue to find fulfilment and creativity in the hobby of using, rather than buying, makeup. Best of luck!
I’m very sorry to hear how hard of a time you’ve been having. I really hope you and your family are doing better and continue to do so!

As for advice, I have a couple suggestions:

1. Try making it exciting to do your makeup daily by:
- making it into a game: randomly/blindly choose different products each day and challenge yourself to combine them into a cohesive look
- try some YouTube makeup challenges or have your friends choose your makeup for the day 
- you seem to have a lot of lip products, maybe you can put them in a box and reach in and grab one at random. That can be your daily lip product. 

2. This one is less “productive” but can possibly help with your overwhelming anxiety and guilt:
- store away your products and only have a small collection of essentials for a month. (This is hard, but in the end will help you realize that you don’t need a lot of products and will help prevent you from relapsing, trust me I’ve been there) out of sight out of mind 
- you can rotate products each month (maybe a month can have a theme or something) 
- it’s kind of like shopping your collection. At the end of each month you’ll be able to go back to your collection and choose new products for the next month. 

3. Finally, I understand how difficult it is to get rid of products. I find that when I’m decluttering I want to keep everything because I consider it all special. You can take away that specialness by simplifying the product:
- it’s a blush. You most likely have another product that looks and works the same. You don’t need multiple of one product. In fact most blushes end up looking the same, there’s only so much our skin and undertones can do
- as for eyeshadow, ask yourself what colors you actually like and which ones are you forcing yourself to like. 
- In general, if you have even the slightest doubt of a product, get rid of it! You should only keep what you love and makes you happy! Imagine you’re going to marry that product lol! Don’t have doubts! 
- I find it easier to donate products to family and friends. It sits easier with me knowing that it’s going to a good place and can make someone else happy instead of just going to the trash. 
- I think Sephora has a somewhat lenient return policy. Maybe you could return some of the unused products?

Please please don’t beat yourself up over it. You are human and deserve to have peace in your life. 🤍
I think you are on the right path, don't be too hard on yourself. Makeup is something you love, don't make it stressful by worrying about the size of your collection. It's great that you've recognised the issue, now you can work on it. But be gentle with yourself and don't beat yourself up about it. You can change your attitude now and work on your mental health, but don't be so harsh.
I think that if you aren’t ready to commit to downsizing, that’s okay! But something I would say is that it might be better for you to try and get away from the mindset of “Well this caught my eye for a reason.” You know the reason. You were coping with a difficult period of your life by trying to get a dopamine hit from shopping. Now, maybe there are some things you genuinely were into and that you would want to use, but I know from my own experiences treating shopping in a very similar way, a lot of the things that I was drawn to, I wanted because I envisioned a version of me who owned that product and felt differently than I felt in my own reality. 

Instead of trying to decide if you’re going to get rid of a ton of stuff or try to test it all out, for now, maybe just try to use stuff that appeals to you when it appeals to you. Maybe pick out a handful of products from each category- some that you have tried and like and some that are new, and box up the rest. Shop your collection and rotate things out when you feel bored or you feel the impulse to shop. Maybe twice a year go through the unused stuff and decide if there are any things you’re absolutely not going to use and then go through the stuff you’ve tried out and decide if there are things that need another try or if you would be better off without.
A lot of us relate fully to this, including myself. Before my first massive declutter last year where I threw out literally 2 medium sized cardboard boxes full of my expired 2015-2018 makeup, my collection was similar to yours. I think a lot of factors contribute to it - one major one being influencers calling it a makeup “collection”. The way that term is now used by the beauty community makes it look exciting and normal for makeup lovers to own drawers and drawers of products. You start feeling compelled to take advantage of every big sale. You feel fomo if you don’t own whatever viral thing every other girl is obsessed with at the moment. Curating the “collection” becomes the real hobby. It usually take a few years until we start seeing it in a different light - overconsumption of hundreds of tiny products that will take motivation and time weekly to apply, organize and sanitize until empty, broken or expired. 

As a former Sephora employee who had a massive collection after working there, a big way I downsize my backup stash of unopened product without feeling guilty is filling the unused cosmetic bags I accumulated (from brand events or as free gifts with purchase) with a whole face routine of full sized products to give as gifts for family and friends for holidays and birthdays. Like a full size mascara, eyeliner, loose powder, blush, bronzer, highlighter, eyeshadow or palette, and a lipstick. My SIL and mom especially love it and it makes me feel so good to know the products are being enjoyed by my loved ones instead of rotting for years in a spare drawer until I get around to opening them. That’s totally an option though and don’t feel guilty if you want to keep and enjoy most of your products for you.

You surely did a hard work on preparing this essay. Glad to know that it finally became materialized and have people see and think about it together!
Wow. I loved every single part of this, and I totally agree. She deserves much more screentime and she needs to be developed! She has so much potential!!!
well, time to read allat
this is so well-explained! i love wendy and i really wish we got that heist episode ☹️"
The Curse of Grief,52,nosleep,
A car centric society is really ablest ,51,fuckcars,"Almost half of all disabled people cannot drive, including me! An autistic woman whose visual processing isn’t fast enough. Until age 27 I had to either beg my parents for rides or use horrifically unreliable disability paratransit. And since paratransit completely books up within seconds due to how much demand there is for it I was mostly begging my parents. Everyone made it clear they did not think I was a real adult despite my having a Masters degree and being able to take care of myself in every other aspect of life.

Then the inevitable happened. My dad developed neurological problems and lost his ability to drive. My mom simply did not have time in the day to chauffeur both of us while also filling her own needs. I was forced to move to a walkable urban neighborhood with usable transit. My parents spent most of their lives believing that even setting foot in my current neighborhood would lead to you getting shot and killed. But at this point, we realized we had no choice. Thankfully my parents now realize they were being prejudiced, but I still need to fight tooth and nail for my city bus system to keep the funding it needs to remain operational. Because in a year or two, my mom’s eyesight will have declined to the point that she can’t drive anymore either.
This is what makes the ""somebody think of the disabled!"" 'argument' from carbrains so infuriating.
I don't disagree with you. But the people who want to completely eliminate cars and make everyone take public transportation are also ableists. For example, my anxiety and panic disorder make it so I can't take public transportation without thinking I'm going to have a heart attack. So, there has to be a happy medium between these two options.
So just because a small minority can’t drive, (a lot of disabled people can drive too) it means we have to restructure our whole society so non-disabled people have to depend on uncomfortable and unreliable public transport, making journeys longer for them simply because they live in a society that has to march to the beat of the slowest drum?
Exactly!"
"A story about my ""dog""",49,nosleep,"Wow- what a real head scratcher!
August knew what was up.


Poor OG Henry!
Wow. Poor Henry. He kept coming home even when he couldn’t.
Holy fuck, the hairs on my arm were up the whole time. There are things in the woods that we shouldn't fw man."
Repost: The Society of Broken Necks,49,Saturdead,"Nosleep sucks. Thank goodness you’re posting on your own subreddit. I wish all authors would do this. I always go to an author’s page when I see a Nosleep story has been taken down to see if I can read it somewhere else. I’m sure others do this also.
Damn, tough break.

You're lucky you got out though. While chronic pain is awful, being bound to an evil man is worse.
Theres a reason people tell you not to talk to strangers
You are one of few where when a story is deleted I come running to you're page to find what I missed. Great stuff as always
This story hit me so hard. I have nerve root damage, although not from an accident, causing me horrific leg pain. I love your stories, I went through your entire backlog months ago and have been keeping up with them as they release, but I never expected to see something this personal.

It is beautifully written, and very accurate to the desperation that results from living with pain like this. It's ridiculous that r/nosleep removed it, but the subreddit has been declining for a while (save specific authors and some one-offs)."
My sister is reliving the same trauma i experienced ,46,emotionalneglect,"She feels quite threatened by you actually being able to fulfil your sister's needs where she is failing. It's all about power and nothing about your sister's actual wellbeing. She needs to have the humility to see her own failing but that seems too threatening for her. 

You're being parentified too, just through their incompetence and out of your own compassion to not let your sister go through the same. You're doing a lot, it's not an easy position to be in. I don't think you can fully protect her either.

You're doing your best. I think it was a good call and mature to not let it escalate more. Be sure to be there for your sister after such an upsetting event and process it together. She needs to know you are an ally for her inside the home. If she can know you're a safe person for her to go to, and that you care about her and support her, I think the damage of growing up in such a home will be lessened.
Your mom's words are super hurtful and reflect how much fear and shame she carries. 


Unfortunately, I don't think you can protect her. It's just not in our ability to shield minors from their parents. The best you can do is to build a good 1:1 relationship with her. Life is long and you two can still be friends long after your mother is not in the picture anymore.


I am hoping the best for both you and your sister. 🙏
>I’ve created this big traumatic memory for her when she’s seen for the first time how scary both my mum and dad can be. Which is exactly what I was trying to protect her from.


Hey now, take a deep breath. You did the right thing, you didn't escalate the situation and your sister knows you are a safe person to be vulnerable with. You didn't create any kind of traumatic memory - that was your parents. You were acting as a life raft for her to hold on during the storm, and showing your sister she's not insane, your mum's behaviour is not normal. 


Maybe come up with a couple of safe words between the two of you, one neutral that you can use in public that gives verbal support (like a cute nickname), and another in case of emergency, that if she needs you, to use the phrase.


Knowing there's someone who has your back is a big gift, that I'm sorry you didn't have. If you haven't read it/audiobook Adult Children Of Emotionally Immature Parents, I really recommend it. It will help you in dealing with them going forward. Best of luck to you both OP 🖤
Your mother is also reliving her trauma, apparently. I don't have any sympathy for her. Just pointing it out. 
Don't blame yourself for being there for you're sister, you should should be proud of yourself. Have you tried talking to your school counsellor or therapist about this? They may be able to help. My heart goes out to you and your sister."
I finally finished No longer human (A review),45,PHBookClub,"I completely agree with your take on *No Longer Human*. Amazing how Yozo was able to process all these things in his head but, unfortunately, was never able to fully materialize what he wanted to achieve in life.

Throughout the story, Yozo was constantly reflecting, analyzing, and trying to make sense of his emotions, experiences, and the world around him. But despite all this, he wasn't able to turn his thoughts into productive actions for personal growth, which led him to his continued downfall and sense of despair. This was the most frustrating part of the story for me. I find myself thinking, ""Had he only done this, it would have turned out well for him.""

And yet, I also understand how it was difficult it must have been for him, having endured so much internal conflict and alienation from society. His mind was a battlefield, and his inability to bridge his thoughts and actions was, in a way, his greatest tragedy.

When I read *No Longer Human*, I was reading it in conjunction with *Men Without Women*—a collection of short stories by Haruki Murakami. Both works carry a deep sense of alienation and the weight of personal struggles. What I found most interesting was the stark influence that women have in these stories.

In *No Longer Human*, women play a complex role in Yozo's life—simultaneously a source of fleeting comfort and further disillusionment.

In Murakami's stories, women often embody a sense of absence or mystery, deepening the male protagonists' solitude.

In my case, my takeaway from this was that both authors showed how relationships can shape one's identity and, at times, even intensify feelings of isolation. Truly intriguing how these themes crossed over between different eras and authors.
Wow, now that I read your thoughts on this I kinda regretted the fact that I didn’t wrote the influences of women to Yozo too, and I agree with everything you just said about it. Though i haven’t read anything murakami yet, I’ll make sure to check some of his works in the future."
WIBTAH If I broke up with my boyfriend of almost 3 years? ,45,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,"I think you already know that you have to leave the relationship. 


Do you have family or friends from back home who can help you move back? Tell them that he is emotionally and verbally abusive (which he is) and you need help. 


Get out. Get out as soon as you can. Abusers who get away with it have a tendency to escalate. 
Taking care of yourself is always the best option
Pack whatever is most precious to you in secret.. then go back to your parents and tell them your in possible danger and you will get your own place as soon as possible. If they can't help find an old friend who can.

Get out while you can. Anyone who says they can't control their own behavior is an abuser.
He is emotionally manipulating you/gaslighting you- yeah, get out and go home or move back to live with a friend.
NTA

You have to learn to end things BEFORE the relationship becomes a train wreck. If you’re not happy, there is nothing stopping you from ending the relationship. 

Good luck."
"Mental Health, let's talk about it ",44,slotmachinequeen,"Very well said and the very same thing MT uses her entire platform to do. Slot and MT are very much the same person. MT just hides it a little better because she has a mod who thinks she’s JC.
Just like her chronic illness is very selective. They flare up when ppl call her out & immediately disappears when it’s time 2 get in the box & scam ppl or go on vacation. She thinks everyone are like her sycophants who never hold her accountable but how b4 her
This applies to O💊ia as well. She actually does it better than $loth and HH. She creates and fosters victimhood so she can rescue.
Mental illness is not a get out of accountability free card. I have a serious diagnosis and if I act like an ass I expect to be called on it.

The fact that she has been accused of so much sexual harassment and misconduct and has not ONCE expressed an ounce of shame, embarrassment or empathy for any of her victims nor seemed to comprehend the gravity of these accusations tells you all you need to know about her.

Lilly is a dangerous, manipulative person.
Many someones let Donald Trump bust a nut in them so I’d say there’s a key for every lock.
it’s gross to think about but there’s going to be an audience for EVERYTHING. I’ve come across an of creator on twitter who would make videos shooting milk and other liquids out of her ass. I’ll never see the appeal but there are people who watch and pay for some very uhh interesting content

That's 100% correct. He may have a dual diagnosis and is being treated for both. Though the way it's written gives off the vibe that he is dipping out from an addiction program which may not be the case."
"I am looking for a new job, and every time I look at the reviews, I see nothing but complaints of bad management and red flags",41,ManagedByNarcissists,"Glassdoor and indeed are both life savers for me. If I see too many 2 or 3s then I don't even bother applying. Both of them save you alot of time in the application process because you'll know what to anticipate. 


Because you're well versed in narcissistic abuse, you'll know what to do when it shows up. Granted, the only solution is to quit and find another BS job, but you won't have the same warped mind fuck the last job gave you because you recognized the BS from a mile away this time.


Remember. You will be lovebombed. Great salary, WFH, whatever. Then they will start tearing you down, months in or years. It all depends if you're targeted. Once you feel you are targeted, run. 

Good luck 👍
It's depressing out there for sure. I have periodically looked at ads to get to know what's out there in my new city. I check out the company and see such negativity in the reviews. The challenge w my current place of employment is that no matter how great my customer service is, it doesn't matter if the product is faulty and the owners are painfully cheap. Our reviews reflect that the customers had a great experience w me, but ultimately, they are dissatisfied w the product. Seems to be that way too often.
I had those exact same feelings, and while things ARE worse than they used to be, it actually isn't impossible to find a good, well-managed company to work for, it just takes time and you have to be diligent and patient in your choices. Hang in there, and if you can manage, don't accept something that doesn't seem right. You deserve better than that.
I have this theory on general MBA's ruining the workplace. When previously people were promoted to being managers, having some knowledge/insight in the area they are supposed to manage, it is now all about the numbers - which is driving down results and leading them to hire more people who have zero clue what they are doing. 


A lot of management degrees also offer them a variety of 'proven tools' but don't make sure these tools are understood correctly and applied in the right circumstances. 


 For instance Open Door Policy. A concept that was meant to open the (metaphorical) door of the manager, having an ear for their employees and is now commonly (mis)understood as forcing employees to keep their (physical) doors open to keep them on their toes.
Keep in mind that people who do reviews are usually polarized - you probably don’t go on Glassdoor to make a review for your past or current workplace unless you have something to get off your chest - either how great or (usually) how awful it was. People don’t go out of their way to make reviews about how ordinary and average something is."

For those still in limbo about whether or not to have kids,37,childfree,"Petty reason: you can't eat anything in front of them without them noticing. Not even a piece of broccoli. It'll be ""Mom, can I have one?"" And then, ""But I WANT one!"" Cue meltdown if mom says no. Every kid I've met does this.
This was incredibly well written and thought out. I agree with pretty much everything you said. Each reason was very concise and had a fair answer to them. I also like that you aimed for getting diverse opinions and reasons from non childfree people to help make your points. I honestly haven't even heard a few of the points you have made and it's given me even more reasons to stay childfree. This whole post was super informative! 


I hope you enjoy your childfreedom with the rest of us here, and thank you for the educational read! ☆
Good post. It was a pleasure to read.
They'll even have a meltdown because they said they wanted broccoli so you give them broccoli and they are upset because they got what they asked for :')
Thank you! This means a lot to me!"
What does someone like Rust Cohle need more than anything? Was there ever a middle path for him?,39,TrueDetective,"I don't have an answer for you, but I certainly appreciated hearing your thoughts about one of my favorite written and portrayed characters in TV.
I think textbook pessimism as a lived philosophy is kinda of fundamentally inhuman, and very hard to hold onto without becoming a hermit
I can only respond in the vein of realism because the show really is a masterclass in that.

TLDR: The guy needed to get help (some form of grief therapy) when his daughter died. He needed some form of trauma therapy (not just a stay at a psychiatrist facility for a few months) after he was done working YEARS undercover in insane circumstances. He had a substance problem that he was NOT succeeding to regulate (as was Marty), and had an insomnia problem that he sought to treat by purchasing street drugs from a hooker - NOT going to a doctor for help (I mean why the fuck would anyone do that). And he never got ANY help for his hallucinations? All of that and not mentioning his childhood (raised in remote circumstances to a survivalist kook in Alaska without access to television or his mother?).

Look at these things this way, and frankly I'd be with Gilbough and Papania. Dude's a great suspect, especially when you see him getting hammered in the middle of the day (pilot script and treatment originally having this be a ruse to pretend to be impaired mentally) and admits he doesn't sleep and hallucinates. I mean jfc, guy's a wreck.

Longer version: neglected in childhood, faces the loss of his daughter and his wife, gets no counseling, takes out his rage at work (working the local drug circuit to death til they were in hotel rooms busting people for very small amounts of cocaine, then murders a junkie on the job), then becomes a wild undercover agent for years in high-stress and drug-fueled environments before becoming a detective at the start of E1.

Someone with that background needs so much help that the last time I watched TDS1 (my favorite ""filmed thing"" EVER) I had to actually shelve it when I was done -- to face that many things and just try to champ them all without any professional help and then wear a gun on your hip ever day is insanely negligent. I realized how much I really idolized the character for the machismo.

His philosophies kept him isolated, and his contempt for other people only serves to cast himself as better and/or smarter (conscious or not) of whoever he's talking about. He's ironically more self-righteous than others, though he never says it, deflecting by saying things like ""everyone is no one"" - kind of a massive difference from saying something healthy like ""I'm not better than anyone - everyone is equal.""

The show is great, but Rust became a hell of a lot less likable to me as I got older. On the other side of that, yeah I kinda get annoyed with the tough guy attitude.

So, middlepath? Fuck yeah. If he would've gotten help with like 1 or 2 of those things he wouldn't be the same level of edgelord and wouldn't have had the same difficulty keeping a job, making friends, currying favor, and possibly pursuing the central case with more legitimacy. But this isn't just a show about the case - it's a show about the 2 guys and their lives, and the case, too.

(sorry for deflecting all the philosophies - I just think most of all that stuff was bullshit fodder to meet his own ends of staying on his own)

EDIT: I forgot to mention at the top that he fuckin hallucinates because of all the drugs and stress he endured, lmao
My personal take is that pessimism is a cold and miserable philosophy and, in a traumatic near-death situation like Rust faced in the end, he desperately needed some kind of human warmth, even if it is bullshit. Basically almost dying broke down all his coping mechanisms and all the walls he had built around himself and forced him to connect with humanity because deep down we're all terrified of being alone. It's like the ""no atheists in a foxhole"" type thing, not that god is real but humans actually terrified for their lives are gonna grab anything comforting they can.
He was abandoned and neglected by his parents and had his daughter torn away from him and his marriage disintegrate. His boo-sucks-to-life philosophy is a means of protecting himself. He needs to accept his daughter's death was a bad thing, and to grieve it.

Philosophically, he needs to get with some sort of Pragmatism and stop chasing the Absolutist ether, and to reject his default to negativity.

""Come down off the cross, we can use the wood"" - Tom Waits.

What he really needs is what we all need - to work and to love. By 'work' I don't mean emplyment, I mean to feel useful. 

I think the shift at the end is because he accepts he was loved by his daughter and his father. He couldn't hold his defenses, and he accepted what he knew - what had driven him to reject life.

The final shot is of Rust finally, literally leaning on someone - Marty.
The middle ground is “curiosity.” 

The universe is absent of meaning. But as a member of our species, we need meaning to survive. Similar to how any living organism needs to find sustenance to survive, human beings NEED meaning. It is fundamental to our individual and collective survival. 

Now, that meaning can come from a cultural blueprint (like religion) or it can be established by the individual search. 

This “search” for meaning is curiosity. It takes intellectual humility to recognize how little we know of the universe (only the ignorant live in certainty). But in that lack of certainty lives hope. And with hope, comes the search."
Ex moved on extremely fast. ,37,BPDlovedones,"Remain calm. Care for your daughter. Wait for mommy's and her hubby's disaster to happen. Because it's inevitable. Fast moving on, fast blood sucking too.
It’s common for people with BPD to move on so fast…. Trust me. I’m victim to it as well. Just focus on your health both mental and physical and your daughters as well. If you need to, fight for custody of your daughter as well if you think it’s worth it.
So many similarities. It sucks.
My first BPD ex got me back the last time by asking me to marry her. 
She was married two years later (only found out last year). 

My second BPD ex was talking about marriage almost from the start. Wanted to be married as soon as her divorce finalized and wanted me to move in. She wanted to go back to China and get married in secret, because she wanted her ex-husband to keep paying alimony. 

I did not really make the connection to BPD with how fast everything moved the second time until well after the fact. 

Thank god I stopped telling my parents about my relationships back in my 20’s. My dad would have wanted to buy tickets and book a hotel immediately, anything to save a $1.

My (positive) diagnostic experience as an AFAB adult + short rant about people dismissing doctors' opinions,37,AutisticPeeps,"I am not a female, but thank you for sharing this. If this is meant for females, then I apologize for posting in response and will delete it. My psychologist did the exact same thing when she assessed me. She looked at how I perceived the world and how my interests were a strong part of who I am and how I light up and always bring the conversation either back to myself or back to that. 

Again, thank you. Trained professionals can see deeper than what most people can see. I was so skeptical myself and said it probably a dozen times or more over the course of our interviews of how I just didn't know if autism is even what I was dealing with and that I only had a suspicion.

Side note: She also said I had a ""unique and interesting"" way of perceiving the world.
Thank you for sharing your experience! I’m also a diagnosed AFAB adult, and the part about your doctor seeing how you perceive and interact with the world being different than others was something that happened to me, too.

I also wonder if some of the issues regarding misinterpreting doctors’ dismissals is genuinely due to poor explanation by doctors. Like, what does “you don’t present as autistic” mean in that context? What hallmarks of their internal experience differ from autism? I think it might genuinely help at least some people if said doctors explained the actual differences they are seeing that don’t align with autism — it might also help rule other diagnoses in that might genuinely be more beneficial to pursue.
Thank you for sharing! Fellow late-diagnosed, AFAB, ""high-masking"" here who also had a positive experience with getting diagnosed. :) 

I also share your confusion about female autism being *so* invisible that even well-trained professionals can't detect it... like??? Like you said, assuming these professionals specialise in and up to date with autism, then  I expect they can *still* can spot the subtle signs. Heck, throughout my entire life, *people always saw my symptoms*, but just never linked it to autism. Like just for the example,  even my first psychologist (who didn't specialise in autism or ADHD unfortunately) could tell that my mannerisms seemed robotic, forced... and they wanted to train me in social skills! 😅 there's more examples but I shan't derail this haha.

 So the idea that someone can be SO good at masking that absolutely *no one* notices even a *single* symptoms is... suspicious Iol.
Thank you for sharing, even though I don’t relate to your story, I appreciated reading it and thank you for sharing.
i also had a positive experience with diagnosis as an afab (i identify and present as female). i really dislike this excuse as well. any assessor worth their salt **will** understand genuine masking etc. i had no idea i was autistic at all tbh and it came up whilst i was being assessed for adhd. i was really shaken by this and my point is that the majority of professionals do know what they’re doing & what to look for. hence why they pick things up. it’s so much more than a tick box exercise. i agree though it would be really good if professionals were able to try and explain this better, because otherwise people just get really mad they didn’t get diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder (?!?!), shit on the doctor/team, and go for a “second opinion”. 

if you do have autism, regardless of presentation & afab/amab, with a good assessment it IS clockable. this especially weirds me out when people who have spent a lot of time on psych wards aren’t diagnosed but say they’re autistic. if you’re under medical supervision in hospital, where your behaviours etc are constantly watched and tracked, someone WILL pick up on it. i already had the diagnosis before going into hospital but the doctor who hadn’t read my notes yet wrote it was very obvious i had autism after meeting me & my parents (my dad is also autistic) for 15 mins. it does get spotted. don’t be scared to get an assessment if you’re afab/femme presenting !!!"
It's happening,34,RetinitisPigmentosa,"I'm sorry. My mother is nearly 70 now and has been more or less blind for the past decade. Take solace in knowing that within the next ten years there will be effective treatment, and you will fortunately still be alive to receive it.
I feel so bad for you man, I truly mean that. I can't read anything on paper anymore either. i use magnification on my PC as well. I can't see shit coming from the left or right so fighting is out o the question for me as well. 

Loosing a passion I can relate too. I can't play 90% of the games I love anymore, but atleast I can still play some games. You can't spar anymore effectively, but at least you can train on your own with a bag. You gotta look for the things you can still do and not look back on what you lost. It's extremely hard but doing this will make your life livable.

I don't know if you ever had genetic testing done, but if you haven't had any done please get it done. There are a lot of treatments inbound, but you need to know your specific genetic defect to be eligible for them.

Stay strong, you have had a lot of hardship besides the RP I see, and I have a lot of damn respect for you. You kept going, and that's why you are a fighter, hold on to that spirit, please!
I know your feeling losing a lot of vision too. I had two shots of Luxturna and in both cases it destroyed central vision badly... Idk what to do anymore and I feel like I made a bad decision in my life believing this drug would help me and not wreck me.
I’m sorry that you are dealing with this. I also have RP and have blind spots during the day now. I used to race bikes so now I’m looking into getting a tandem so i don’t have to say goodbye to my hobby. It’s a bummer to lose things. 

I started making a list of things that I’d always be able to do to make myself feel better, many of which are adapting hobbies from before. Examples would be audiobooks, riding my peloton, learning an instrument, practicing learning more Spanish, massages, talking to friends on the phone, dancing (poorly but unabashedly) etc. I found that trying to key in on things that are not being taken away helped me to find some positivity. I am an artist so I am terrified of losing the central vision I have. I’m sorry.

How do I get out of this mess? ,33,AlAnon,"You say your kids are of utmost importance 


"" I don’t want to cause my mom problems with her friend when rent doesn’t get paid if I leave.""


 Sometimes you have to slightly inconvenience other people to protect what's important to you. Don't put your mom's hypothetical problems above getting your kids to a safe place. Maybe he'll leave, but if he doesn't id consider what you're protecting by staying and what you're putting in danger. 
Given the fact that you have decided to separate, I think you need to go through the proper legal processes to unwind your relationship and finances.  This will take time and due process.

I wouldn’t give him “his money” out of your earnings because he will likely use the money to drink.  This directly enables his renewed addiction and the problems this causes in your life.  A proper legal separation would clarify what money you are each entitled to from matrimonial assets (if there are any) and income.
Please be careful. The most dangerous time for women is when they leave their partner. 💞
I made plans and slowly moved.  I ensured that before I told mine I wanted a divorce, I had a place to stay. In secret, I rented a place a month before, and during that month I slowly moved important stuff (heirlooms from my mom) and off-season stuff (my Christmas stuff, winter clothes, etc.) - basically things he wouldn't realize was gone.  I also bought new furniture, and I didn't tell him until (a) I had the utilities turned on (b) I had furniture and (c) I could easily leave immediately and go to my new place.

When I watched ""Big Little Lies"" years ago, I remembered the scene where Nicole Kidman's character's therapist recommended this because one never knows how an irrational spouse will react.  

It took me about a year to save, plan, find a place, etc. And that time was worth my safety. If I made more money, I couldn't moved earlier.
I just want to tell you that his choices are not your responsiblity. I know addicts say bold statements such as I want to kill myself for attention and then a lot of the time they don't do anything. Addicts are like children who want enabling, support and unconditional love even though they mentally and physically drain those around them. if he says things like this, don't take it on. The best thing you can do for all of you is to put up firm boundaries and stick to them. Your kids need mama."

Down the street from my office sits a lovey cafe. The tables are covered by umbrellas, shields against the eternal drizzle that covers the city. My lunch is so routine, the server doesn’t even ask my order anymore. I sit down and look out on the traffic and passers-by. Chelsea drops by with my tea not long after, and I smile gratefully at her before resuming my people-watching. Suits and skirts, children in overalls and shorts and rompers, busses and cars and motorbikes all drift past the stationary shops and houses.

Across the street sits a man, his hair sits as a woollen mass atop his tanned, wrinkled head. His beard hangs down in a sheet of steel wool, bushy and thick. Black glasses sit atop his tomato-shaped nose, and he sits and listens to all those who pass.

Day after day, he sits beneath the eaves, next to the dumpsters that never seem to house trash. Sometimes he sings, a low and growling sound, and the alley echoes back his shanties and cowboy hymns. Mostly he just sits, unseeing eyes staring through opaque shades, and waits.

Invariably, as I finish my sandwich and start on the desert parfait, a gentleman in a suit too rich for this middle-class street comes along. The exchanges are always respectful, their opening “Hey there, Old-timer,” always brings a smile to his face. He calls them by name, pats their back, and tells them of all kinds of things.

“Big sale at Sally’s salon on Third today, be sure to drop by and get a haircut. You’re gonna need it.” He tells one of the men, and sure enough the next day I see him walking down the road, talking with another gorgeously tanned man in a suit.

“It’s an awfully warm day today. Be sure to drop by Jerry’s florist shop on Beech, and bring a tall drink.” The next day, it was reported that a fire had broken out next to the shop. The meth lab next door was burnt to cinders, but the flowers were left untouched thanks to a fire truck that happened to be nearby.

I finished my parfait and left a fresh bill on the table— exact change with a 30% tip, the same as every other day, and moved across the street to sit next to the old man. I murmured in greeting, and he nodded at me in acknowledgement. Sure enough, a rich man soon walked by and mentioned greeted the old man.

“Heya, Sal. You met this girl? I think you should. Show her to the theatre after work, there’s a show on she’ll love, and you’ll know why that matters about the second act.” He nodded my way, and Sal quietly bowed and offered me his hand. I smiled at my grandfather, the man who listened to the whole town at once, and he grinned back in his knowing way.

Sal was wonderful company, and the play was as charming as ever. My favourite part came up, Elizabeth read Mr. Darcy’s letter, and I could feel my face light up with the squeal it always brings me. I looked his way, beaming, and Sal’s eyes widened. He dove at me, pressing me against the ground as the bullets began to fly."

Most new players nowadays come to this subreddit and they're told to start with DST, which imo is a terrible way to start because it's not aimed at single players and it's strayed further and further from the original game's spirit.

But don't let my old man ramblings ruin your experience: you're doing good kid. You're gonna get far.

>I guess that's the biggest plight of it all. You have been holding this secret world for so long, and you still have to keep it to yourself a long while longer. You finally understood, but that did not make everyone else's misunderstanding suddenly go away. Is it worse to be the only one to know the truth while everyone is still blind? Or would have I been happier never knowing at all.

Yeah... have ran it through my mind... should I tell people at work, my parents, family? It never turns out well. If I tell people online about Schizotypal disorder they either won't care to understand it or it'll make things worse. Learning about the disorder has made me feel kind of hopeless in regards to socializing or creating close bonds with others.

You're an ant fighting against someone with a magnifying glass on a bright sunny day. This exact scenario has been happening across the country and I have only heard of one time where the people got to stay with new conditions and it was a Airbnb. I have honestly unfortunately have not heard of anyone winning this kind a battle.


If it was me, the first thing I would do would be start looking for a lawyer to do a class action lawsuit for anything that can be a class action lawsuit or fighting for more time or fighting for relocation benefits. Contact the media.. all of them as many as you can. Start fighting by going to City Hall council meetings and get as many people as you can there to say what a hardship this would be, and it would create more homeless people. Legal or not legal? I'd stop paying rent. Save up as much money as possible. What are they going to do? evict you? They're already evicting you. 


I generally wish I had some better advice. But unfortunately in these times greed just keeps winning over and over and over

What Do You Want from Your Speech Synthesizer?,27,Blind,"I remember those speech synthesizers from back in 1987... In fact, I remember the Speak and Spell toy's voice from even before I went blind. Which is probably why I do well with espeak. On my iPhone, I use the default Samantha voice. It just has a good balance to my ear, and I don't have to worry about switching and installing voices on any i device I use. Some natural voices don't sound too well to me at the high rates I've built up a tolerance for over the years--a kind of distracting choppiness--and a slow responsiveness of the commands to the speech stream is completely maddening. They had it right in what they wanted back then.

One thing that can be an issue is that a non-natural speech synthesizer is disturbing to sighted people when you use it on a device in public, and they can't understand what it says.
wow, this is pretty cool.

My journey with TTS is a long one, but I'm now at the stage where reading fiction with Eloquence generates character voices in my head. I reread Robert Heinlein's Space Cadet last night and, the parts of the story in training where they were in spacesuits sounded different, in my head, as though I were hearing the characters speaking over earpieces and headsets. My reread took an hour 40, the audiobook is about 7 and a half hours. Now obviously that's a huge difference, but I've been using eloquence for nearly as long as I've been using Windows.
I also binged thousands of pages of Harry Potter fanfiction in the years between books 4 and 5, content unavailable in any audio form. My use of audiobooks had already long been on the decline, but that nailed it.

Reading aside, I find using Eloquence as my daily driver efficient and reliable. I don't want a Human in my ear, I want the data from the screen in as an effective form as possible, not a Human interpretation.

I was born blind in the 1980's. I was lucky enough to be given a Talking Language Master during the last few years of my primary schooling, then access to a BBC PC and eventually DOS then early windows after that. I probably began using Windows full-time when I was introduced to JAWS with version 3.2, although I'd be using it like a shell with a hardware synthesizer and a British screen reader called Hal before then on and off. I still found DOS more useful for most things back then.
I like the in between. I don't do well with espeak, but love eloquence or vocalizer. If something like 11labs was my screen reader voice, I would not be able to listen and use my devices either. They are just to human and expressive.
I lost my vision in 2014, so didn't grow up with the robotic voices, though did play with all the Mac novelty voices in MacOS 8 and 9 to read back stuff I typed. I strongly prefer normal and realistic voices since they are easier on my ears and much easier for me to parse. I stay far away from all Eloquence-style voices and get irritated when I have to listen to them. The rough robotic voice sounds just pull my attention away from whatever I'm trying to do or comprehend, and I picked up screen readers much more quickly when using them with the natural voices.
My wife used the DEC Talk PC  for many years but had to give it up due to OS changes. Used DEC Talk PC USB for a while, then JAWS. Alzheimer's means no more PC usage, though.

Wife used to listen at 2-3-4 times speeded up. She was a judicial officer. So she scanned thousands of pages of documents, used OCR to convert into a readable format to be able to function. Conduct hearings, read documents submitted by parties, then write her judgements. She was appealed to the High Court in Australia a number of times but was never, NEVER, overturned on appeal.

She swears that DEC Talk PC was the best. Reading at 3-4 times speed DEC Talk PC was still intelligible.

She did not care about human sounding, but that the speeded up voice had to be intelligible."
Has my weird mom actually been AuDHD the whole time? I got recently diagnosed with ADHD..,26,AuDHDWomen,"I could go on and on. But, the short answer (as it relates to my own mom) is…yes! Whenever I read people in this and similar subs describe some of these things about their parents and attribute them to narcissism (that’s just such a cultural touchpoint in the U.S. and in media), I drop a bomb that their parents are likely ND and it’s always met with silence. 

One’s own PERSONAL journey to diagnosis can be confusing and conflicting, so, it follows that seeing your parent through this lens might be too.

Not only can I relate to that moment of shock, BUT, I have specific things I can relate to in your story: my mom is a great singer and would regularly, without fail, sing more loudly than the choir in church. Like, ZERO social awareness. She also overshares SO SO much. I ALSO realize my mom likely has echolalia. It has been a tailspin to have the moment of recognition, but I’m pretty sure it’s true. Shrug.

For me, there’s not much I can do. Years and years of this intertwined relationship that has the potential for strain in solid, NT relationships has exhausted me. I know more and it helps me give her some grace. And that’s about it.

Could chat about how I put the pieces together in my own life, if you’re open to it!

Diagnosis is a lot to process, so it’s no wonder you’re thinking about what it means for yourself, and perhaps the places you inherited it from! Your mum could be experiencing neurodivergence too. Have you spoken to her about it? 

I think I remember a post a while back on the ADHDwomen Reddit where someone asked the group how many of them had a narcissistic parent, and there was quite a high response. 

I have also read Janette McCurdy’s ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’ - which was brilliant, and a little bit like you - it really resonated with me and my own upbringing! I have recently been doing some reading into the links between neurodivergence and being raised by narcissistic parents, and I have found it really helpful in understanding my own behaviour, and how I was raised.
Reading this in fear because my current obsession is trying not to fuck up my kids so they end up hating me, while probably doing just that. If any of you have answers for OP let me know because I feel like my kids have written this from the future.
It's hard to separate trauma symptoms from autism because society as is stands provides no options for raising an autistic child without traumatizing them. 

That said a lot of the signs you see in your mom are trauma symptoms including oversharing, shame, and lack of a social network. 

The loudness and inability to shut her mouth could be ADHD. The low threshold for injustice and change could be autism. However there's much here that may be pure trauma. 

Being physically beat by your entire immediate family and never allowing yourself space to recover or have other loving relationships messes with one's brain as much or more than natural neurodivergence.
I know we’re not supposed to diagnose others or ourselves, but ever since I started doing more reading about neurodivergence and understanding what the symptoms look like, I kind of suspect my whole family has something going on. I definitely see it in my own mother (although she is a lot different from your description of your mother). 

And I honestly kind of think you can easily start to see these patterns in your own family members, and it’s kind of justified to see it in your parents since it’s known to to run in families, especially if you have been formally diagnosed yourself. And we now know how it is much more common in women than previously thought. 

I think it sounds like she has some complex issues though. Like she definitely had a traumatic upbringing but also it sounds like she is definitely autistic. 

Some of your descriptions sound exactly like my sister. My sister has recently been diagnosed with ADHD- hyperactive and she also believes she is autistic. It makes sense to me because:
- she also has the motor-mouth thing going on
- she definitely tends to over share and talk about stuff that you shouldn’t about in public, and she gets defensive if I tell her we’re not supposed to talk about those things in public. It seems like she has a hard time understanding social contexts
- she also has poor spatial awareness and coordination and stomps and slams doors without meaning to, and I don’t believe this is stimming by the way, as well as dropping things frequently (I also have this issue minus the stomping and slamming doors though)
- she also has difficulty with changes (when she was a little kid she would have meltdowns, and I think I did too; they called them temper tantrums back then)
- she’s also super smart (and can come across arrogant at times), I think being told how smart she was as a kid didn’t help
- she’s also highly anxious (I think it’s basically a defense mechanism that develops due to repeatedly having getting in trouble for saying or doing the wrong things, and I have this too but to a lesser degree), 
- she also has the sensory issues with clothes
- she also was bullied as a child. 

I don’t know if all of these things you listed count as aspects of autism or adhd, like I’m not sure that being confused about your sexuality is related? I think part of it must be cultural. A lot of older patriarchal cultures have made women feel ashamed for their sexualities and the only way to be a sexual person was if you were trying to get pregnant. 

I think the shame and self-criticism is an aspect of depression. Honestly, it sounds like she has severe untreated anxiety and depression, and maybe it is partially because of her being different her whole life and the trauma that can cause a person. And it could be related to her religious upbringing or just the way she was treated by her parents, or all of the above. 

Now I don’t know how productive it is to give her this label if she isn’t seeking it herself. But I feel like it can definitely help you understand your own upbringing and relationship with her by viewing it through a different lens."
MIL,22,motherinlawsfromhell,"I hear you.  Sounds like you have decided that you have spent 6 years of your life trying to be a wife, mother and partner, but he is still treating his mother as his wife, and you are second place.  It is unfortunate to say but it sounds like you need to move on for your own mental health -- sooner rather than later.
You can’t have it both ways. You can’t attack her via text and move on for your own sake. First off you resent this woman, that’s fine. This issue is you’re trying to get you husband to simply cut off his parents. That’s not a choice you get to make. You can go NC. You can leave the home for visits, you can grey rock, and not respond. But honestly you can’t try to force a choice. They are his parents, despite everything he loves them, he wants them in his life. Trying to push an ultimatum is destroying your marriage. Your husband’s inability to choose is hurting you as well as his inability to fight for you. That is an issue. 

But texting a family group chat all of your grievances? That will blow up in your face. You will be the bad guy, and it will look that way. If you feel you absolutely have to I would speak to your husband first. Explain that this build up of hatred is hurting you and your marriage. That you have specific points that you would like to speak with MIL regarding. Set ground rules and arrange a meeting. It probably won’t go well but at least your issues are out there. Then you and you alone can go NC.
Is your counsellor an enmeshment trauma counsellor?

The porn is very very common with enmeshed men. Food addiction is the way most enmeshed women go. The porn addiction is not about you, it started well before you and it's your husband's attempt to emancipate from his mother, but within a relationship, it can cause damage. Ken Adams covers this concept well. Please don't let it impact you, it's not about you although it can feel very personal. 

Don't bother texting the group chat, they don't care. Just take your child and leave, take your space, go to a hotel and have a holiday and tell your husband when he rings you that he needs to think about what's most important to him, that you won't hold it against him if he chooses his mother, you just want to have the facts and he needs time to decide. Don't overwhelm him with anger or emotion, that's what his mother does. 

Just be matter of fact and start to look at options for your life. As another person said, you can start taking your child to playgroup on the weekend, you can go away for the weekend, you can book your child into some kind of class, you can stay home when he goes to his mother's. You don't have to do what they say and you can be your own circuit breaker as your husband is clearly unwilling to. Don't wait for someone else to make it OK for you to live your life as you wish. 

Please get support and help just for yourself, particularly with the losses and grief you've suffered. Take yourself out of the house with your child to physically limit the contact so you can find yourself again and connect with your child. If your husband comes along for the ride, great, if not, leave him where he is. Best wishes.
So, which is it? Do you want to attack her in group chat, or do you want to move on?
 Maybe it's time for LO to join a Saturday morning play group. If you are gone before she arrives, no drama in your face. If she wants to wait around, maybe she and her dear baby son can enjoy some quality time together and clean the house.
Unless husband is willing to do the hard yards in enmeshment therapy along with couples therapy, then I think you have your answer…..

No point sending messages to a group chat. 2 card your husband and do as you say - 6 years of trying but it’s too much…..  I wish you much luck and happiness moving forward."
Weakness is not a good thing and it should be avoided where possible.,23,TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Weakness is comparative. It's kind of like ugliness. It's always gonna exist. It's hard to even have a concept of what strength and beauty are without weakness and ugliness. It's not possible to know what is high if you don't know what is low.

Yes, we should strive for improvement, but we will never reach perfection.
I think you are missing the point when people say it is ""it's okay to be vulnerable"" or ""it's okay not to be okay."", people do say we should be, but sometimes you just are not in a good place, and you shouldn't be ashamed of it, in that way it is okay to be vulnerable.

Often it is because of this dumb notion that we shouldn't show weakness, and we should just hide it away, be a real man or some other dumb notion, but we are all weak at times, and it is okay to be weak at times, it isn't something that you should hide away and eat at you from the inside.

So in short you are missing the whole point when people say that, no one is saying go and be weak, sad and vulnerable, but that you shouldn't he ashamed and hid it, work through it, or get help, that's the whole point when people say those things.

It's like when people say it's okay to eat chocolate, doesn't mean you should go out and eat it all the time.
Can you actually give an example of a person thinking a weakness is a good thing? Specifically, how it relates to the disabled community?
>""it's okay to be vulnerable,"" or, ""it's okay not to be okay.""

My dude, ""it's okay to be vulnerable"" means ""don't live your life with your shields up all the time. Get to know people.  Let them get to know you. You don't need to appear perfect because you're not.""

""It's okay to not be okay"" means ""it's part of the human Condit that at some points in our lives we will not feel satisfied with who we are. We should accept that this is something everyone experiences. That's okay. You can get through this.""

Not understanding this is a *you* problem.

>therefore, it can never be said to be bad to have these things, and furthermore, it must actually even be good to have these things.

Even without knowing the context of whatever ""comment section"" you are referring to, I can tell you didn't understand the conversation. People were *very likely* explaining to you how we shouldn't stigmatize people because of weaknesses, or that weaknesses are natural or ""good"" in the sense that we should accept them as part of the human condition and not ignore them.

I *highly* doubt that anyone was trying to argue that the condition a weakness leaves you with makes you ""better"" in every way.

I can *see* the shadows of the straw men you were building in that comment section.

>This becomes blisteringly obvious the moment we throw up some thought experiments oriented in the opposite direction.

That's a *fantastic* euphemism for ""straw men.""

>and the more of it that we have, the better. In fact, we should actually seek to impair one another as a favour

You can't possibly think this is a logical extension of the ""It's okay to have a weakness"" position. This is braindead logic. As in, people would only think this is the logical extension of that saying if they were braindead. You are assuming everyone is incredibly stupid and can't understand that a pithy saying isn't always meant to be taken literally.

Do you have similar problems with the literal interpretation of ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away""?

>But if we do agree that something is a weakness, and in many cases we can, then it follows that this weakness is not a good thing

Sure, but the two exceptionally vague truisms you are whining about (""it's okay to be vulnerable"" and ""it's okay to not be okay"") *are not saying what you think they are saying about ""weaknesses.""*
Your whole Idea is based on the Idea that there are objective weaknesses. What would these be ?"

Finally overcoming my biggest question about islam|will non muslims go to hell?was Aisha 9? Are slavery and concubines allowed in islam?,22,progressive_islam,"Regarding Slaves and Concubines, In short, Slaves are not allowed and someone is under your influence, you need to have nikkah (marriage) with consent before you can't touch each other.

Surah Nisa 24.

*Also (prohibited are) women already married, except those legally yours: Thus hath Allah ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property,- desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefit from them, give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.*

***You need to get context as well read the ayat before 24,...***

Surah Nisa 23

*Prohibited to you (For marriage) are:- Your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, Mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (Who gave you suck), foster-sisters; your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in,- no prohibition if ye have not gone in;- (Those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful;-*

These goes over that **these women are forbidden for you to marry**. Except what has already happen, as you didn't know that it is against Allah's command. I don't see Rape anywhere here...Instead Allah is asking men to give gifts and desire chastity not LUST.
Hi OP,

  
Let me answer questions directly from QURAN: in Short, just by BEING ""MUSLIM"" doesn't qualify for heaven & just by being ""non-muslim"" doesn't mean automatic hell.

Surah Muhammad 47.12

إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ جَنَّـٰتٍۢ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَـٰرُ ۖ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يَتَمَتَّعُونَ وَيَأْكُلُونَ كَمَا تَأْكُلُ ٱلْأَنْعَـٰمُ وَٱلنَّارُ مَثْوًۭى لَّهُمْ ١٢

Verily Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; while those who reject Allah will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode.

Surah Al-Ankabut 29.7

إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ جَنَّـٰتٍۢ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَـٰرُ ۖ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ يَتَمَتَّعُونَ وَيَأْكُلُونَ كَمَا تَأْكُلُ ٱلْأَنْعَـٰمُ وَٱلنَّارُ مَثْوًۭى لَّهُمْ ١٢

Those who believe and work righteous deeds,- from them shall We blot out all evil (that may be) in them, and We shall reward them according to the best of their deeds.

and finally Almighty mentions that there will be a scale and 1 good deed is worth 10 points while 1 bad deed is worth only 1 point:

Surah Al Anam 6.170

مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُۥ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا ۖ وَمَن جَآءَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ فَلَا يُجْزَىٰٓ إِلَّا مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ ١٦٠

He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit: He that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil: no wrong shall be done unto (any of) them.

Surah Mummin 23.102

فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُۥ فَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ ١٠٢

Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful.

Surah Mummin 23.103

وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُۥ فَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ فِى جَهَنَّمَ خَـٰلِدُونَ ١٠٣

But those whose scale is light, they will have doomed themselves, staying in Hell forever.

Regarding Aisha being 9, This is historical perspective, Quran rejects this.

From Quran, Muhammad is not a Human but a messenger of GOD and is not father of any of men. He is seal of the prophets (certifier of prophets, a prophet can't claim to be one without certification of Muhammad)

33.40

Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah, and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.

3.144

Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then Turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; but Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude.

Some therapy would be helpful. You can reach out to your local community mental health center as they provide therapy to people who would be otherwise unable to afford it. Social services in your area can also usually offer some concrete assistance. Good luck.
Love the last paragraph & how you ended your post with determination + positivity. Yes — you will bust though & we'll be there with you along the way! ♥️
I like how from your last paragraph I can see you aren't giving up, but damn I can feel the pain there.

When we are at the height of confusion, cognitive dissonance and half-worn off brainwashing I think it's very common and easy to wild out and do bad things. Doesn't mean we won't or shouldn't face the consequences of our actions, but I think we can face them clear eyed and not beat ourselves up give in to despair. We are victims and that created conditions where we sometimes did bad things, either for rhe cult or in rebellion to the cult and we might pay a price for that, but our stories don't have to end there.

Now you can work on yourself to be a better person and create the conditions where if you ever giving a chance to rekindle a relationship with your son you can or if he ever needs you, you can be there."

Thoughts on がらくた - JUNK ,21,KenshiYonezu,"My mom and I had a very rocky relationship for the past 10 years and the madness peaked when I was pregnant 2 years ago. I've been on edge ever since and prepared to cut ties if things get out of control. Earlier this year my mom had a psychotic episode while visiting me and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It turns out she has been hearing voices for a really long time. This song made me feel like a piece of garbage in the most cathartic way.
Yonezu talked about this song on Spotify Podcast. There are subtitles. I think you can refer to it.

This song is based on a friend who had a mental breakdown. If you read my comment on the Himawari post, the friend mentioned in JUNK is most likely Matsumoto Dai.
It’s one of the best melodies I’ve ever heard, I say that about almost every Kenshi song but there’s just so much sheer emotion bundled up in this one. He gets at something so deep, I’ve listened so many times already and i’m still just barely beginning to get a handle on the emotional vibe.

I'm in a similar situation and being targeted by a neighbour as they are only unkind when they see me with my cane (I'm a part-time user). Fortunately, I was moving anyway due to the other conditions I have but it's social housing so, like you, I don't know how long it will take.

I'm just sick of it and really hope I'll have kinder neighbours in my next home.

Are you renting? Is it actually easier to move?"
What is your local hospital like?,21,schizoaffective,"I live in Finland. In my area psychiatric inpatient care is free for the patient.
I can use my laptop, phone, and have my own toiletries. I can use my own pyjama or they can provide one (this also applies to toiletries).
There is food four times a day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, evening snack. All kind of special dietary requirements are taken into account.
But there is really nothing to do, no therapy or group activities.
My experiences in the past have actually been really good. No cell phones but you could earn walks twice a day, and you could order out food. I only had a few bad run in's with other patients that made it clear they wanted to hurt me but the staff sorted that out quickly
In NY and the hospital I stayed at is kinda shitty and clearly underfunded but the staff is generally trying their best.

No electronics allowed so only books, coloring, board games and the TV in the lounge were there to distract yourself. Family and friends are allowed to schedule visits to bring you stuff. There were groups twice a day with arts/crafts and discussions about building life skills. Also had rec time for 45 mins every day where we could listen to music outside on the deck or use the gym. 

The food wasn't bad honestly. The burgers and chicken tenders were pretty good and they put out snacks a lot too so you never went hungry.
no phones no toiletries some clothes no shoes no outside access bc then an alarm would ring and you will get “booty-juiced” - room bound at certain times of day only allowed a book MAYBE pencils to draw. at times we could go outside to the 25ft x 25ft roof with walls that had 10 inch thick windows and was covered with a giant cage (there was nothing to do out there)


I'm in Canada and it varies with if you're on an involuntary hold, or have self-admitted.  

The last time:   initial room in ER had no bathroom and a nazi nurse at night who refused to let people out of their locked rooms to go to the bathroom.  These rooms were in a locked section of ED and no, you couldn't have anything

Then you're moved to the psych ward.  Those who have self-admitted can go out to a courtyard and smoke, can leave with family for periods of time, and have their phones.  The psych floor has a locked/secure entrance and sign-in/sign-out including for visitors.   The rooms have a toilet and sink."
sometimes I just want to cry.,19,Parentification,"The turning point for me was a random youtube video the algorithm suggested to me, in which a therapist demonstrated a roleplay of a healthy parent saying to their adult child, ""I know you're worried about me, but I've got my own therapist and circle of friends for support. I don't ever want you to feel like you need to be my therapist."" I had a full-body reaction to the idea that my mom would ever have the self-awareness that she had turned me into her caretaker. 

It's been a slow process of disentangling myself from that enmeshment, but geographical distance (living far away), therapy, and education has really helped. Recently I've been really impacted by the book ""Discovering Your Inner Mother"" which deals with the concept of the mother wound and re-parenting yourself. It also talks about the way the family system often demands a parentified child stays the way they are, as caretaker, family secretary, and mediator, and resists the child's attempts to change. 

I think what you're feeling is grief! It makes a lot of sense. I don't think the grief ever fully goes away, but as things start to shift in your life, I really believe you can find more peace and that the heaviness will start to lift.
Damn your situation sounds a lot like mine. I see how much love you have for your family. I understand what it’s like to be the eldest and “first to complete” those benchmarks. Now when younger siblings struggle, we are the ones they turn to. 

I also understand the fear of an enmeshed family ruining your relationship or hope of love. Your partner understands you and loves you. They will not leave you for seeing you cope and manage this unfortunate situation. Your life is for you to live. I believe you making this post is an acknowledgement of that, and I’m proud of you.
I'm really sorry. It's very overwhelming to carry so much responsibility before we are ready to do it. It's encouraging to me that you have already redirected things in order to care for yourself, taking a different job and role in your career. How you sound in what you write reminds me of the many grief cycles I've gone through over the years. Usually during life transitions of some kind; like maturing, next stages of relationships, the age of my kids, stages of education, stages of jobs and career, my health. It was like all the stress and worry would get heavier, and that feeling of crying. But from way down deep and unspecified. I learned it was grieving (denial, anger, bargaining, sadness, acceptance). And those moments were the stage of grieving where you need to cry. I also learned that I needed to do a better job of prioritizing myself as much as I cared for others. I didn't need to care for others less, although that happened as I learned about boundaries, but I did need to care for myself in equal measure. One for one ratio.

Education (like therapy) helped tremendously. Understanding what was going on in my internal world, gaining language to describe and talk about it, learning tools for coping and feeling more in control of my existence all has led to stability and peace. There's still plenty of moments where I struggle, but not remotely to the depth that you speak of. So things do get better. Also, meds. Those are a God send for giving you some stability and peace while you learn how to create that for yourself but haven't quite gotten there yet. Five stars. Haha

Hang in there. Each tiny change you'll make with the help of your therapist creates a ripple effect that lasts a lifetime. It won't be like right now, forever. There's light at the end of the tunnel. BIG hugs because you are not alone. ♥️♥️♥️
The solutions that you find for family situations must include the family member's participation in the solution, including financial solutions. Call family meetings and let them know that the weight of their problems are causing you hardship and together you need solutions that will raise all your boats.

I think isolating for a couple days is a fabulous technique. Are you regular? I'd just schedule it if I were you and regular. 
I'm sorry you are going through this"

Thank you so much for this information! We are reading these papers now."
Should I report my manager to HR,20,jobs,"I would start to look for another job. HR is not your friend, they will not force the manager to start doing their job, if manager hasn’t been doing it for the past few years, then HR probably knows about it. Since you were kind of enough to take on responsibilities that were not in your scope. They are now taking advantage of you.  You could try and push back if you were forced to train a new hire again and the manager bailed on that day.
Stop doing any extra anything. Let the person who was promoted to it all. It’s not your responsibility anymore since they made their decision. Smile and nod with the best attitude that you’re not having to it all. Next time at your new job that you really should start looking for never reveal personal issues. They used it against you, lesson learned.
Stop being the ""pretend shift lead."" Act your wage and start to look for a new job. I've been on the receiving end of the ""you'll get it next time for sure"" speech myself. Spoiler.alert: you'll never get it next time either.
Sorry you didn’t get the position OP.

I don’t think you have a case with HR though. Don’t let it go years of doing additional job duties for no extra compensation. Also don’t tell them about your personal life issues or it can be used against you.

I suggest applying to another clinic for that role while you remain employed there. I would also quit doing any of the additional work immediately.
I agree with the other commenters who said that HR isn’t going to resolve this. Your boss showed a serious lack of professionalism and ethics in lying to you about a job interview. I’d start looking for a job elsewhere and include on your resume that you led shifts. Your manager clearly has no problem lying to you, so you can assume any offers of promotion won’t materialize. How can she take credit for your work when you are getting the credit? You are not being compensated for the job you are actually doing. 

Breaking down emotionally at work isn’t ideal, but it happens. I don’t know when I would have left an abusive working environment if I hadn’t had an emotional breakdown. I definitely sucked, but ultimately it gave me the drive I needed to leave the situation. It also made me realize that the working environment was not normal. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this!"
MST Podcast ,17,womenveterans,"Sounds very brave and I fully support please keep us posted
I hope you're ready for therapy after hearing the stories because thinking about this is triggering for me. This is deep and can go even deeper. I wish you much success, and thanks for being a light of awareness that many of us need.
Support and if you need another story. 🙏💔
I probably shouldn't participate because it would be too much for me, but I wish you the best. I'm glad you're shedding light on this. So many people have no idea how widespread MST is. I want to share my story because it could possibly benefit others but I'm not sure if it's something I can handle.
I’m service connected at 70% for issues due to MST. Can confirm they do sweep that shit right under the rug. Both of my experiences were to protect them and give me the middle finger because they outranked me. 

Happy to chat about it privately and anonymously."
TW: Domestic abuse ,18,Dhaka,"Don't go to police, please look for women & child protection organization. Reddit is used by very nieche people of Bangladesh. I'd suggest to write this in Bangla in desparately seeking dhaka facebook group. Ask for any help from such organization, your goal should be to find a mediator to talk on your behalf to your parents. Trying to make them understand what you are going through. It'd be challenging to support yourself with education if you leave your parents. So take measured step. If you really want to break free of them, then you have to be financially independent. Try to learn some skill, like, design, web site development, wordpress development, wix site building, SEO, marketing etc. Try to get some work from upwork, fiverr etc. then you can support yourself & study
This is very unfortunate and quite common in Bangladesh. I have seen something like that in my own family. My relative is now in serious mental distress. She is now getting help from physiatrist and lots of medication and yet to get better. I really don’t understand why parents in Bangladesh like that. It’s also not safe at all for lone girls in the country. See if your parents will allow you to abroad to study? If so that will be your best option. Really don’t know how can anyone help you? If anyone try to help they might get in trouble from your parents.
Since you're 19 now, is there any way you can have your own NID made? You can open bkash account with your NID.
First of all I think you should contact some specific women helpline in bangladesh (I don't know if they are still on after what happened in bangladesh). Polive will not do anything rather they can make your situation worse. You will not find any good advice in reddit because most bangladeshi don't use this app. Create a new Gmail account that is just yours and post many anonymous (if you want to be anonymous) post in Facebook groups that is based on helping each other. You can also post in groups that are related with domestic violence. Fleeing your home would end badly given the current situation in bangladesh where no kidnapping case is being picked by the police and media. Sorry if this is personal but can you tell me your district? I'm from chittagong, if you are from chittagong than I can help you with helpline and shits. Don't give too much ear to them. Personally I've never experienced these type of things but my older sister was emotionally abused by our entire family so i wanna help as much as I can. Your story feels very similar to her but she fought every battle and honesty lives a better life. Of course you will feel depressed, who wouldn't in your situation but please believe in yourself and believe that your situation will change. Motivate yourself with the online work you want to do.

Does anybody else feel like they’ll never be the same? ,18,LifeAfterNarcissism,"Yea I don't think I'll ever be the same and it irreparably altered my worldview and destroyed the last remnants of any self confidence I had. I'm seeking therapy soon though so idk
That's what narcissistic abuse does to a person. I am not the same person I was before. TBH, I'm not sure who I am right now. I just know that the old me is gone. I've tried getting back to her, but she no longer exists. It's hard to accept, but we're capable of healing and growing into better, stronger people. It isn't easy and a lot of patience is required, but it's possible.
I'm not the same person I was. I'm not functioning as I used to; I feel so much pain and blame myself for bringing myself to this lowest place. I feel stupid for believing him, I feel stupid for falling for him. Sometimes I hear his voice in my head, laughing at me or attacking me, while I try to stay focused and deal with basic daily tasks. My ability to function as a person has completely changed for the worse. I had a goal to become a psychologist; I was full of fire and passion for my goals. I enjoyed studying in college and was good in my classes. I returned to college this year, and now I'm failing. I’ve never failed a course before. I just couldn't study, no matter how many ADHD pills I took. The pain is too distracting. My inability to function also affects my social life, my career that’s going downhill, my ability to trust new people, and my ability to trust love.

It's been almost two years, and although I'm getting better (with the help of a great psychologist), I'm still not the same, and it feels like endless work. I haven’t been able to feel genuinely happy again since then. I do feel things, but it's like everything has weakened. Every emotion feels like an echo of something buried inside me, trapped by the memories of being abused for so long.

If you haven't heard about CPTSD, you should look it up; maybe it will help you understand yourself better. Part of PTSD is depression, so everything you feel has a name and a way to handle it. I recommend starting therapy with a psychologist who is an expert in dealing with trauma and depression.

As I said before, it could take time, but it's worth it. You are not alone.
I know not everyone will have the same experience as me but I feel like I’ve changed because my boundaries are much stronger and my standards are very high now.
My Faith in God has really helped me in my healing and in feeling loved after this very terrible and hard to describe..Narcissistic Abuse.
Now days I feel good! Took years!
