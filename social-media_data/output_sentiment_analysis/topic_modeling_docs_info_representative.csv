only time i leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult 

but i live alone don't really have support 

since i look so normal and functional unfortunately 

plus people think because i'm a black man i'm immune to being disabled or having a disability 

just kinda hard because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community 

it effects me daily 

it's detrimental on my economic status 

it's hard to just text and talk on the phone

"yeah your reasons for being on disability is valid

how much non visible as well as visible disabilities effects people 

well for me i have severe panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder 

and bipolar disorder and unspecified ptsd, and recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability 

just get tired of the abled body making disability like the olympics 

like people have to compete with each other to see if they disabilities are severe enough for disability

"and thank you for helping me feel validated and less like a fraud. i’m on disability for multiple mental health reasons and sometimes o feel like my family, friends, and doctors look down on me for it but my therapist has been helping me combat that. mental health issues can be debilitating and dangerous, i’m glad it’s a valid reason for disability even if it’s a hard battle to be approved.
i’m on disability for mental health reasons (panic disorder with agoraphobia). i just wanted to thank you for posting this. mental health struggles are no less valid or debilitating. it makes me feel a bit less depressed to know that others (like yourself) understand.

"the other disability program is ssi - supplemental security income for the blind, elderly and disabled.  it is a means-tested program with very strict income and asset limits for eligibility, and the most it pays is currently less than $ per month.   he will not be eligible for ssi unless he was actually living in the u.s.  

i'm unsure of the answer to your question about disability evaluations conducted by a non u.s. physician, but i suspect the answer is they would not be enough for social security purposes.   to qualify for social security disability, the claimant needs very complete, compelling medical documentation.  this is especially true for mental health issues.

"i did not mean to scare you by suggesting genetic testing but i also know how different these things can present and my son only got a doctor who is his advocate and listens to me once i had genetic tests done because as you said “must be faking there is no damage”.

so ruling that part out might show a path to understanding and proper care. once he started seeing doctors at chop in philly i legitimately wanted to go beat the shit out of everyone in my state my son has been seen by who called themselves a fucking doctor. 

the difference in treatment was staggering. 

perhaps reach out to them? even though they are a children’s hospital they see adults because of how much research they do on visual impairments. it felt a lot more comfortable to deal with doctors being so open to how much they don’t know about the eye. so the team there would not be the type to say “you are faking” and just dismiss you.

studying offline is always a better idea, there's a slight chance you'll end up making friends there which will help a lot, but again a greater chance of you just ending up alone and ignored.

expecting accessibility accommodation's from any uni in india is like expecting politicians to be saints, so you have to have work arounds for most things and most expenses are out of pocket for any and all assistive tech/ help that you might need/ require.

they do allow you writers for exams though, people who read the questions to you and will write what you say( don't get me started on how horrifyingly bad and or wrong this can and does go at times), although now they might also allow you to take your exams on a pc with a screen reader and or magnifier.
