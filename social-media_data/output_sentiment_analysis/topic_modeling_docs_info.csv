i'm in california about to start my masters in mental health counseling, but i wanted to reach out and see how things turned out for you. i know it's been a couple of years.
i would like to know more about your experience as a therapist who is blind. i noticed that you posted about it a few years ago. i am about to begin my master's degree in mental health counseling and would appreciate any advice or support you can offer.

"with pets you also don't have to worry as much if you're still processing some emotions. for example, if you rushed into another relationship with a human partner but still hadn't processed the emotions from your previous partner, you're bound to cause some confusion and hurt feelings for both of you, but this doesn't apply to pets as long as you love and care for them.

just because it gets me emotional knowing because you don't see me walking in a cane or wheelchair

keep myself groomed

one of the most influential people in my life was eric gallegos, though i called him pete. i met him when we both worked at a movie theater called krikorian theaters in redlands, california. pete was ten years older than me, and he played a significant role in bringing out the musical artist and writer within me.

at the time, i was a clean-cut, plain kid with no radical style. pete, on the other hand, was the original goth-emo type—dark and poetic, yet incredibly down-to-earth, intelligent, fit, and usually happy-go-lucky. despite the age difference, we became close friends, and even ten years later, we remained in touch.",8,8_wife_pete_years_miss,"['wife', 'pete', 'years', 'miss', 've', 'think', 'things', 'don', 'life', 'wasn']","['ex wife', 'wife', 'therapy', 'marriage', 'advice', 'married', 'grieving', 'grieve', 'mental health', 'ex']",['Coping with Heartbreak and Loss'],"['wife', 'pete', 'years', 'miss', 've', 'think', 'things', 'don', 'life', 'wasn']","[""so... unfortunately, i don't have much advice to give. as you can tell, my mental health is still miserable. i've been suffering immensely from this break-up. but at least i can empathize with you %. and just one recommendation: try to find something that gives you joy. i started participating in a theater ensemble. it's not quite easy with my disability but the people in the group are very nice about it. i've always wanted to perform a theater play and now i get to do that this year. they even gave me a lead role, which i'm very proud of. the new hobby hasn't made the pain go away but it has made it at least a little more bearable. i practice at home almost every day and at least during that hour that i practice, i forget about my wife and i focus completely on the material. so... if there's some kind of hobby you can do that would give you joy, maybe you should consider trying that out.\n\nobviously, i'm incredibly sorry this happened to you. you've got no idea how much i feel you."", ""omg are you me?? seriously, i've gone through exactly the same ordeal one year ago. the only difference in my case was that my wife also moved out right away (literally the next morning after telling me she'd leave me) and moved in with another guy  weeks later. turns out they had already been seeing each other for a while. but i don't think he was the main reason she left me. her main reason was my disability, which has gotten significantly worse during the past - years. just like in your case, my wife didn't talk to me about her struggles and when she finally dumped me, she refused to give our marriage another chance. i begged her to go to therapy with me. i made a million different suggestions. i told her she could move out but we could stay married, so she'd feel more free. it was very painful to make these suggestions but i made them anyway. but she just said no to everything."", ""i, too, was very scared of the practicalities. but looking back from  year in the future, i can promise you that the practicalities will be figured out. i was very stressed about them in the beginning but i'm now doing pretty well in this department. i'm living a very independent life and i'm proud of that.\n\nwhat hasn't gone away is the pain and lovesickness. still today, i think of my ex-wife every single day and i dream of her most nights. i miss her so, so, so much. when i masturbate, i think of having sex with her rather than other women. i know it's not a healthy behavior but i can't help it. it's humiliating, knowing that she's living and having sex with some other guy now but i can't help it. i'd do absolutely anything to get her back. just like your wife has done, my wife told me some extremely painful things right after she left me. still, i'd take her back in a heartbeat.""]",wife - pete - years - miss - ve - think - things - don - life - wasn,0.9559228385228105,False

"six years late, i’m still trying to put myself together. 

if it wasn’t for my partner and our kids, i wouldn’t be here. 

he has made me fall in love with him even more,  a hundred fold more than i ever thought possible for being the most amazing human being and helping me recover. funding thousands of pounds worth of therapy and never once judging me. i thank the stars every day for this man. 

i don’t think we will ever be the same again hun. but we can rebuild as better versions of ourselves. 

the only good thing to come from it all was, for me, it humbled me.

i think the ssi benefits should fill the economical needs we disabled people need without having to relay on relatives: rent, energy, food, medical bills, special education, and maybe some basic leisure like sports, outings, books, etc.

i mean... it's not a whim, right? we didn't choose to be disabled. i think we have the right to get help to live peacefully. we already have it very difficult because of our disabilities, isn't it?

of course, if we improve and become able to study and work, we will immediately want to try and do our best! because nobody feels good being neet and getting excluded from everything in life...

") obviously there's a spectrum of disability, and there can be concerns about including those who have ""less severe"" conditions as disabled. my response to that is that that's always been the case, and that that rhetoric is often used to reinforce systems of ableism. (for example, mental health disorders, other invisible disabilities being included as disabilities) labelling yourself as disabled is such a personal thing based on your own experiences with the world around you, and i think denying someone that is really counterproductive to promoting a less ableist society.

i have been in your position,  i attempted suicide due to the chronic pain i had endured for  years. i couldn’t take it anymore. 

however i was able to get to a place of radical acceptance. it takes time and you need to be in a place whereby you are mentally strong. 

defo consider changing or starting anti-depression meds. once mine were changed, i felt so much better and gradually the depression began to lift. 

i accept now that my body doesn’t work like other people, and it never will and i’m ok with that.

feel like eugenicists want me dead 

not trying to trigger anyone 

just your ex situation sounds like my situation 

but you have to do what's best for your mental health 

i didn't take it personal.

even though it was family members 

that i couldn't reach out to 

disabilities in my life is just hard 

just people don't realize saying learned helplessness 

they don't realize it's not too much help as you think 

and plus it's a very huge waiting list 

sometimes years long

just getting help is not immediate

just not enough resources

at the end of the day, it isn't your responsibility.  they need to make an effort to either get a job or file for ss disability, section , food stamps, medicaid, and find housing.  you didn't indicate what the disability is.  are you actually caregiving, like feeding, bathing, etc, or just financial?  you're not family.  even if you were, it's not worth sacrificing your mental health for this.  it sounds like you have your own family in the home as well.  so they're dealing with this as well?

"as someone on the other side, thank you.

i had dated my boyfriend for  months when he suddenly had a stroke.
it's now  years later and he's doing so well, i'm so proud of how far he's come. 

he's in a wheelchair at times, and has aphasia and right side paralysis.

he's lost soo many friends, it's been heartbreaking.

it's been so hard on him and..it's been so hard on me. often i feel ignored by others and my struggles and pain are ignored because he had the stroke.

the impact this has on the loving partner is often ignored and you just have to suck it up.

we all need to work on cross-disability solidarity for sure. some folks with mental health issues need to shed there internalized ableism and not shy away from the disability label. and some visibly physically disabled people need to expand their own definition of disability to include and support folks with invisible disabilities.

"this kind of communication can be a challenge, even for people in the best state of mind. for people who are experiencing mental health problems, it can be really challenging to feel triggered and not become reactively defensive. some people may be able to practice skills that make it a bit easier to manage their triggers in a more productive way, and some have less capacity for it. for those who have some capacity to do so, these skills can help diminish triggers from turning into unmanageable emotional cascades.

usually not. not if you are interested in having a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas. if you just want to push someone away in defense, it can go either way. the other person may either back off, or they may respond by escalating the situation further. it’s a gamble.

this reminds me of feminists that put down other women for their choices; this is why i detest third-wave feminism.

"there’s a very pervasive culture these days of self-diagnosed “codependency” and confusion about “support vs enabling.” too many abled people are being taught in therapy and self-help groups/forums to withdraw from relationships where people need support due to disability, under the false premise that someone who doesn’t get therapy for their challenges is being enabled. they are taught to go “no contact” because withdrawal of friend/family support allows the targeted person to reach “rock bottom” where they must seek out help. this is a false and dangerous example of when “therapy” is harmful, and actually becomes a form of abuse/neglect toward the most vulnerable. not everyone can “think” their way out of their physical and mental health challenges by talking to someone or doing a workbook. sometimes it’s not negative self-perspective that is the problem, but one of a lack of ability and adequate support.",-1,-1_health_just_like_mental,"['health', 'just', 'like', 'mental', 'mental health', 'people', 've', 'life', 'don', 'pain']","['disability', 'disabilities', 'disabled', 'mental health', 'autism', 'support', 'therapy', 'able', 'anxiety', 'mental']",['Challenges of Living with Disabilities'],"['health', 'just', 'like', 'mental', 'mental health', 'people', 've', 'life', 'don', 'pain']","[""yeah your reasons for being on disability is valid \n\njust made me also think about my personal experience with people like that \n\nlike it makes me very sad that some people don't understand \n\nhow much non visible as well as visible disabilities effects people \n\nwell for me i have severe panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder \n\nand bipolar disorder and unspecified ptsd, and recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability \n\njust get tired of the abled body making disability like the olympics \n\nlike people have to compete with each other to see if they disabilities are severe enough for disability \n\nwhich true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function \n\nwhich this does \n\nwhich i have agoraphobia i'm the opposite i can't be around people \n\ni can't even go to the hospital without having a panic attack \n\nlike live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent \n\nbecause i still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function"", ""i'm in the uk and in a similar position with my mental health. just because some twisted scheme doesn't give you the label of disability doesn't mean you're not disabled by your condition. you deserve help so you can better meet your basic needs while working. i'm really sorry this doesn't seem to be available to you.\ni relate to this a lot! even within the disabled community i am not disabled enough. i have a lot of mental health conditions and am chronically ill. i have a service dog to help me and thanks to him i can work again. but i constantly feel overwhelmed and like i’m doing too much but i don’t have another option. i need money to get the healthcare i need. and to get that money i need to work. it doesn’t matter how dizzy or depressed or weak or exhausted i feel. i have no other option. i am not disabled enough for help, but i’m not able enough to do well. so i’m just stuck"", ""like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent \n\nbecause i still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function \n\nonly time i leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult \n\nbut i live alone don't really have support \n\nsince i look so normal and functional unfortunately \n\nplus people think because i'm a black man i'm immune to being disabled or having a disability \n\njust kinda hard because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community \n\nit effects me daily \n\nit's detrimental on my economic status \n\nit's hard to just text and talk on the phone \n\neven right now i'm getting a headache \n\nbut it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability \n\ntry to explain to ignorant people that are ableist like you dealt with \n\ni'm quite the opposite i can't stay with people i would have a panic attack unfortunately \n\nit's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis""]",health - just - like - mental - mental health - people - ve - life - don - pain,0.0,False

"i agree with your usage of the german word behinderung, ""being obstacled (sic)"". however, you are directing it in the wrong direction. hearing people are the one suffering from behinderung, that is, via creating policies, procedures, laws, medical models, and many other environmental harms that causes normal deaf children to become literally cognitively and/or psychologically disabled from linguistic deprivation and/or educational deprivations. 

don't believe me? here is a simple snapshot of a disabling world hearing people created against the deaf people:

it is the hearing populations failure to understand the world in a proper way that causes no harm that makes them disabled and we need to assist them with their disability. one way is by creating threads like this to address it, especially addressing misconceptions such as yours.

i have hypermobility, i am obese, i’ve also been underweight, i had no difference in pain levels(all over 35yrs old).

hormones can affect pain so it’s worthwhile trying to see an eds specialist to go over your pain and body and lifestyle.

i manage my condition in the gym, many edsers dont. i use splints and braces. i do this for my mental health as inactivity aggravates my mood (i don’t have depression).

if the position was reversed and they you were told you could only ever use a braille note and couldn't use a computer you wouldn't be thrilled is that just a preference or would you learn to adapt



it's one thing if there's a reason to adapt like i said i've gone through about five different stages of device through my lifetime


but it's another thing to switch all together notice those five different devices i'll use a perkins keyboard all you similar systems all you similar operating


lord adapt means to alter something to fit a new environment not to throw away everything for something completely new that has nothing to do with anything else and no connection to the previous anything whatsoever that's more than adapting

this is a sighted world. how a document looks makes it easier to read which is very important in the workplace. actually, it’s very important everywhere. i hear your various arguments but the bottom line is if you’re planning on being a successful adult you are going to have to make some changes. it is not easy learning things that we have no interest in but, if you’re planning on joining the workforce , knowing jaws is a necessary step to getting a decent job in an office environment for most visually impaired people. you don’t have to do it. but don’t expect the world to adjust to your stubbornness. we all like to use the devices we like to use, but if circumstances call for us to change we have to adapt.

"fnd and conversion disorder are both very real and the symptoms can be very disabling. have you seen a neuro pt at all? i'd highly recommend getting in to see one. they are pretty amazing and the one i got to shadow could pretty quickly work out if it was something organic or if it was something functional. she also has an awesome success rate with her fnd patients.

i'd also highly suggest seeing a psychologist. dealing with unexplained symptoms is tough and you need to look after your mental health as much as your physical health. poor mental health can make your symptoms a whole lot worse no matter what the diagnosis turns out to be, but if it is fnd or conversion disorder then it'll really make things a lot harder to recover from.",12,12_pt_eds_pain_disorder,"['pt', 'eds', 'pain', 'disorder', 'muscle', 'like', 'stuff', 'exercises', 'hypotonia', 'don']","['hypotonia', 'squat', 'diagnosed', 'posture', 'spectrum disorder', 'congenital', 'symptoms', 'pt', 'exercises', 'md']",['Hypotonia and Hypermobile EDS'],"['pt', 'eds', 'pain', 'disorder', 'muscle', 'like', 'stuff', 'exercises', 'hypotonia', 'don']","['i\'m willing to try pt again at some point (hopefully before i lose my medicaid) but i really want a better picture of what\'s going on at first so i can stop telling people these vague things and ""maybe\'s"" and maybe also find a pt familiar with what my issues are instead of just any old pt, i might see about it over the summer depending on what happens between now and then since it wouldn\'t work well with my class schedule right now\n\ni have hard time with coordinating different muscle groups at the same time to properly do some exercises though (potential chiari has been dismissed so maybe undx\'d dyspraxia), they had to cue me on stuff up until i was discharged so there was minimal improvement in that area and that\'s something that gets in the way of doing stuff on my own which is kinda what\'s necessary for pt, very annoying', ""i also have congenital hypotonia for me my issues were caused by a connective tissue disorder (hypermobility spectrum disorder).\ni had a pretty bad bout of influenza once but that was so long ago i couldn't say whether or not that was the trigger, i also have generalized joint issues + generalized hypermobility but any pain/other problems related to that have virtually disappeared since taking continuous birth control so seeking evaluation for possible hypermobile eds (i was denied genetic testing due to lacking certain clinical criteria so monogenic eds is unlikely i guess) or generalized hsd isn't as high a priority on my list as all the stuff i have that sometimes occurs alongside it (on top of the fact there's no medical professionals around me who know enough about that stuff), for the pots getting testing for potential sfsn/other nerve problems is something i'd seek out before anything to do with heds or ghsd"", ""fwiw i’ve always had mildly lower core muscle tone and i was in ot for something sort of related. we tried starting to work on it but i didn’t tolerate it well and my ot said it would be very long term/slow. it’s not so bad that i felt up to that at the time haha (it’s more that i can’t do stuff like rock climbing or treading water, doesn’t affect my posture like yours does), but i have been slowly trying some yoga that focuses on that. but yeah maybe getting into pt/ot could help even if it is slow going like mine said.\xa0\na few things about your post really stand out to me. if you have pots, it's extremely common to also have some form of ehlers-danlos syndrome (eds). that usually presents with hypermobility, joint and/or tendon pain, frequent joint dislocations or subluxations, things like that. only a few types of eds have been genetically sequenced so getting gene testing isn't necessarily guaranteed to produce an answer for you on that disorder.""]",pt - eds - pain - disorder - muscle - like - stuff - exercises - hypotonia - don,0.49676942987921285,False

you could write a list to hand over during the appointment, send an e-mail in advance, give a powerpoint presentation, make a diagram.


the first session will start with your therapist going over their terms of service, and making sure you understand their duty of care/mandatory reporter responsibilities, and consent to be their client.


then they'll ask why you're seeing them, and that's when you give the rundown of all the stuff going on with you.


it might help you to prepare a timeline in advance that you can refer to. (when various conditions/symptoms became obvious to you, when you received diagnoses, key periods of abuse or traumatic events, etc.)

i don't have the paperwork on hand, i'd have to look at it. iirc since i can use a computer there seems to be the impression that i could do call center work, data entry, stuff like that. those things are also out of the question due to my mental health and fibro, i can't keep to a schedule, meet deadlines/quotas etc, i am extremely forgetful and can't focus on work, i struggle to keep up even with video games more complex than shooters. 

i simply don't understand how it's been denied so many times, i have multiple letters from doctors verifying that i'm disabled and can't work.

"one of the styles i love is called contra dancing. it’s a traditional dance form that requires sets of partners arranged in a line. they then perform a dance choreographed by a caller. the dancers perform the dance sequence in each set before progressing on to the next set to repeat the same choreography. one of the reasons that i particularly enjoy this style is what i think of as the puzzle factor. each dance could be described as a new set of sequences that get you from one end of the room to the other, but there’s a lot of creativity that can be involved in how you get there. there’s also a lot of social fun to be had along the way; community, togetherness, laughing at our mistakes, enjoying friendship.

don't rely on your vision, use it as an extra pare of hands as it were when necessary, and instead of using read aloud, start using screen readers for both the pc and mobile. the sooner you do this, the better off you will be in the long run, could also give magnifiers a go, should they be of any help with the amount of vision you have.

unfortunately, whilst screen readers do work with pdfs, and do not necessarily need to be converted to word, the flowcharts and tabular information is often screwed up. don't rely on what your uni is teaching you, just see the topics they have, and learn them online through edx, khan acadimy and so on.",21,21_blind_using_screen_screen readers,"['blind', 'using', 'screen', 'screen readers', 'readers', 'visually', 'phone', 'visually impaired', 'use', 'skills']","['impaired blind', 'visually impaired blind', 'visually impaired', 'blind person', 'legally blind', 'visual impairment', 'blind life', 'impaired', 'accessible', 'impairment']",['Blind Life Skills Training'],"['blind', 'using', 'screen', 'screen readers', 'readers', 'visually', 'phone', 'visually impaired', 'use', 'skills']","['my guess would be that he is a bit resistant to these things and is trying to do everything like he would as a fully sighted person, which is probably really holding him back. a lot of people our age would try to deny how visually impaired they really are and stay away from all the assistive tech that could free them. this is something that talking to other low vision people could help with, as i’m pretty sure the results are fairly self evident. you just can’t be successful at life as a blind person if you keep on denying that you’re blind.\n\n(i am doing a lot of guessing at he state of his vision here, but even if he is not legally blind he may have enough of a visual impairment that a lot of these things could help him. canes, for example, aren’t only for the blind. there are quite a few people who are not legally blind but can still benefit from using a cane in situations that require it.)', 'how good is he at using a computer, a tablet and a phone on his own knowing that he’s fully blind?  for all those devices, the screen, reader, software is free and built-in to the phone in the tablet and for the computer it’s also free and offers a lot of support for visually impaired and blind people.  getting used to the screen reader on his phone is key because that’ll help him understand and be able to navigate screen readers, and what he would want to do for the future is get very comfortable with using the screen reader on a computer.  i know i mentioned the tablet and i don’t think the tablets too important, but just keep in mind that’s gonna be pretty much the same experience as using the screen reader on his phone so that’s not necessarily important as long as he has a decent phone, that’s he can use.  just being honest here, but the google pixel phones on the android side of things, and pretty much all the iphones on the apple side of things are super accessible when it', 'now, there is a whole other aspect to this that is also worth investigating, because it sounds like your father needs to cultivate some blind life skills that will help him regain his independence and self identity that he so badly needs right now. i believe that at a certain level of visual impairment you need to develop blind skills or spend the rest of your life thinking everything is closed off to you. i have pretty good acuity for a legally blind person but enough problems to make me have to do almost everything the blind way, as much as possible, so that i can use my little bit of vision for the things it is still good for. i can’t read long text, get very little out of screens and can’t do any fine work visually. i have to use screen readers for everything tech-related and other assistive tech and alternative techniques for everything else. using these tools is what helps me keep working, keep paying bills, be on the web and every kind of self fulfillment. without them i would']",blind - using - screen - screen readers - readers - visually - phone - visually impaired - use - skills,0.6323754209942453,False

studying offline is always a better idea, there's a slight chance you'll end up making friends there which will help a lot, but again a greater chance of you just ending up alone and ignored.

expecting accessibility accommodation's from any uni in india is like expecting politicians to be saints, so you have to have work arounds for most things and most expenses are out of pocket for any and all assistive tech/ help that you might need/ require.

they do allow you writers for exams though, people who read the questions to you and will write what you say( don't get me started on how horrifyingly bad and or wrong this can and does go at times), although now they might also allow you to take your exams on a pc with a screen reader and or magnifier.

when it comes to mobility and going anywhere alone in india,

forget walking on the roads, it mostly consists of walking about and asking for help from people to get to where you want to go. to be fair the people in mumbai are lovely, but asking for help of any kind has always been very difficult for me, at least.

uber and such help a bit with mobility though, as long as you can afford it.

yeah of course the best way is having a white cane. they have short ones that are not for actual orientation and mobility called identity canes that are smaller and will help let people know that you can't see. i'm in the same boat as you and i don't look blind either. sometimes i close my eyes and keep them closed which always makes people wonder why would he do that and then they noticed my white cane and they don't ask anymore questions about the obvious situation. i've tried wearing dark sunglasses but i live in a hot place so my face is always getting sweaty and who likes that? i use a long white cane which is pretty big and hard to miss especially in crowds as the handle sticks up above my shoulder and people behind me can see that i have the white cane so they don't try to push past me when i'm in line or walking in a group. there are options to get free white canes but i guess it depends where you live. good luck,-1,-1_health_just_like_mental,"['health', 'just', 'like', 'mental', 'mental health', 'people', 've', 'life', 'don', 'pain']","['disability', 'disabilities', 'disabled', 'mental health', 'autism', 'support', 'therapy', 'able', 'anxiety', 'mental']",['Challenges of Living with Disabilities'],"['health', 'just', 'like', 'mental', 'mental health', 'people', 've', 'life', 'don', 'pain']","[""yeah your reasons for being on disability is valid \n\njust made me also think about my personal experience with people like that \n\nlike it makes me very sad that some people don't understand \n\nhow much non visible as well as visible disabilities effects people \n\nwell for me i have severe panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder \n\nand bipolar disorder and unspecified ptsd, and recently got diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability \n\njust get tired of the abled body making disability like the olympics \n\nlike people have to compete with each other to see if they disabilities are severe enough for disability \n\nwhich true definition of disability is something that effects your daily life or function \n\nwhich this does \n\nwhich i have agoraphobia i'm the opposite i can't be around people \n\ni can't even go to the hospital without having a panic attack \n\nlike live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent \n\nbecause i still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function"", ""i'm in the uk and in a similar position with my mental health. just because some twisted scheme doesn't give you the label of disability doesn't mean you're not disabled by your condition. you deserve help so you can better meet your basic needs while working. i'm really sorry this doesn't seem to be available to you.\ni relate to this a lot! even within the disabled community i am not disabled enough. i have a lot of mental health conditions and am chronically ill. i have a service dog to help me and thanks to him i can work again. but i constantly feel overwhelmed and like i’m doing too much but i don’t have another option. i need money to get the healthcare i need. and to get that money i need to work. it doesn’t matter how dizzy or depressed or weak or exhausted i feel. i have no other option. i am not disabled enough for help, but i’m not able enough to do well. so i’m just stuck"", ""like live alone but that doesn't make me fully independent \n\nbecause i still can't keep a stable job and have friends and function \n\nonly time i leave my house is to shop and check mail which is difficult \n\nbut i live alone don't really have support \n\nsince i look so normal and functional unfortunately \n\nplus people think because i'm a black man i'm immune to being disabled or having a disability \n\njust kinda hard because my disabilities is just as valid as anyone else that is in the community \n\nit effects me daily \n\nit's detrimental on my economic status \n\nit's hard to just text and talk on the phone \n\neven right now i'm getting a headache \n\nbut it's a lot of agoraphobic people that live alone that's my disability \n\ntry to explain to ignorant people that are ableist like you dealt with \n\ni'm quite the opposite i can't stay with people i would have a panic attack unfortunately \n\nit's hard to just check in a hospital for a crisis""]",health - just - like - mental - mental health - people - ve - life - don - pain,0.0,False

 - disabled (as per the social model) is about whether your community or society disables. while broader society does disable deaf people, the community around deaf people does not. once given access to community, language and communication - there is no disabling factor. there are also many global templates of what deaf intetrated societies look like.
 - its a trait variation that carries ability, sure, but so is ability/aptitude to do various sports or needing glasses and niether of those are considered disabilities. it can (and should be) completely normalised, or given its own cultural space, and therein be not a disability but just something that some people have like haircolour.

personally - i think you either have to accept deaf as part of disability or use it to critique the ideology of disability completely (with the aim of bringing other disability groups along with us into whatever comes after). doing just ""i'm deaf not disabled"" is a half-job.",0,0_deaf_hearing_asl_language,"['deaf', 'hearing', 'asl', 'language', 'community', 'health', 'interpreter', 'mental health', 'people', 'sign']","['deaf', 'hearing world', 'hearing people', 'hearing', 'mental health services', 'impaired', 'sign language', 'mental health', 'therapy', 'disabled']",['Deaf Mental Health Services Oppression'],"['deaf', 'hearing', 'asl', 'language', 'community', 'health', 'interpreter', 'mental health', 'people', 'sign']","['yes deaf community need more mental health therpaist, first of all if you dont know sign language start taking classes you will need to be fluent in sign language first before you can provide your service to deaf community otherwise the therpay processing wouldnt be effective. it would be more effective if you are fluent in sign language. not just sign language you need to be also very familiar and understand deaf culture too\nnot in the us but yes we took my daughter to a play therapist who knew bsl. i think everyone should have proper access to mental health services.', ""my wife is a deaf therapist, and we live in a deaf mecca (rochester, ny) and she's very frustrated with the mental health system here. there is a serious lack of residential treatment facilities that can accommodate deaf patients. it's even worse for difficult patients, because they typically get kicked out of rtf's due to serious behavioral issues. and that basically means they have absolutely nowhere left to go.\n\nif it's that bad here, then it's likely much worse everywhere else. hearing people basically don't give a damn when it comes to mental health services for the deaf, and deaf therapists have difficulty trying to push this issue through the hearing-centric system. \n\nfunding for deaf mental health services also is a joke. everything is run on shoestring budget."", ""maybe talk with deaf wellness center.  it's in rochester and they have deaf therapists and resources for mental health for deaf people.""]",deaf - hearing - asl - language - community - health - interpreter - mental health - people - sign,0.4358399056334374,False

-for any emergency information and procedures, especially for students with specific medical needs, type them up on one sheet, the largest font that will fit, laminate it onto red paper, and post it by the phone or the door. 

-it is helpful if you introduce her to people and fill them in on what they do and privately share who is good to work with and who is… not very supportive. 

-ask if she has a preference for communicating information. i once had a ta who preferred to have a checklist of things to do each day. it was annoying and tedious to write it out, but it really did help the day go much smoother.

this gives us the idea that we all should be hearing. this is hugely detrimental because that assumes we all had hearing and lost it. that is not true. this gives an inherent assumption that not having full hearing is ""less than"". i understand that by default, there are limitations for us because of our hearing, because of the entire framework of society is based on hearing people!


are we ""less than"" people that are automatically normal in society just because they can hear because it was built for them?


ironically, i can't watch the philosophical video because its not captioned! thats because majority of viewers are hearing and would not have a problem watching, and i am irregular. is that my fault?

youre not exagerrating, hypermobility sucks. you need to find a pt who specifically knows a lot about hypermobility. most don't have a clue about it. 


however even with a hypermobility informed pt, you likely will be expected to self-advocate, and the main focus will be exercises. unfortunately we have to teach ourselves a lot and fight for ourselves


try your best to figure out what your personal goals are (ex. more support with mobility day-to-day to increase function, self-care, etc, and preserve energy so you can actually do the exercises), and practice asking for help with them, and write questions up ahead of time. also write down your limitations (ex. can't stand with your knees bent). the more prepared you are the better it goes. it sucks because it's a lot of effort and i wish theyd take more initiative, but they don't, so we have to :(",12,12_pt_eds_pain_disorder,"['pt', 'eds', 'pain', 'disorder', 'muscle', 'like', 'stuff', 'exercises', 'hypotonia', 'don']","['hypotonia', 'squat', 'diagnosed', 'posture', 'spectrum disorder', 'congenital', 'symptoms', 'pt', 'exercises', 'md']",['Hypotonia and Hypermobile EDS'],"['pt', 'eds', 'pain', 'disorder', 'muscle', 'like', 'stuff', 'exercises', 'hypotonia', 'don']","['i\'m willing to try pt again at some point (hopefully before i lose my medicaid) but i really want a better picture of what\'s going on at first so i can stop telling people these vague things and ""maybe\'s"" and maybe also find a pt familiar with what my issues are instead of just any old pt, i might see about it over the summer depending on what happens between now and then since it wouldn\'t work well with my class schedule right now\n\ni have hard time with coordinating different muscle groups at the same time to properly do some exercises though (potential chiari has been dismissed so maybe undx\'d dyspraxia), they had to cue me on stuff up until i was discharged so there was minimal improvement in that area and that\'s something that gets in the way of doing stuff on my own which is kinda what\'s necessary for pt, very annoying', ""i also have congenital hypotonia for me my issues were caused by a connective tissue disorder (hypermobility spectrum disorder).\ni had a pretty bad bout of influenza once but that was so long ago i couldn't say whether or not that was the trigger, i also have generalized joint issues + generalized hypermobility but any pain/other problems related to that have virtually disappeared since taking continuous birth control so seeking evaluation for possible hypermobile eds (i was denied genetic testing due to lacking certain clinical criteria so monogenic eds is unlikely i guess) or generalized hsd isn't as high a priority on my list as all the stuff i have that sometimes occurs alongside it (on top of the fact there's no medical professionals around me who know enough about that stuff), for the pots getting testing for potential sfsn/other nerve problems is something i'd seek out before anything to do with heds or ghsd"", ""fwiw i’ve always had mildly lower core muscle tone and i was in ot for something sort of related. we tried starting to work on it but i didn’t tolerate it well and my ot said it would be very long term/slow. it’s not so bad that i felt up to that at the time haha (it’s more that i can’t do stuff like rock climbing or treading water, doesn’t affect my posture like yours does), but i have been slowly trying some yoga that focuses on that. but yeah maybe getting into pt/ot could help even if it is slow going like mine said.\xa0\na few things about your post really stand out to me. if you have pots, it's extremely common to also have some form of ehlers-danlos syndrome (eds). that usually presents with hypermobility, joint and/or tendon pain, frequent joint dislocations or subluxations, things like that. only a few types of eds have been genetically sequenced so getting gene testing isn't necessarily guaranteed to produce an answer for you on that disorder.""]",pt - eds - pain - disorder - muscle - like - stuff - exercises - hypotonia - don,1.0,False
